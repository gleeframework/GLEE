"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is above Bob's value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly opening:** A friendly message helps to establish a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Open ended question:** Asking for Bob's thoughts invites him to respond and keeps the dialogue open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Selling to John is not optimal:** While selling to John guarantees $120, I'm hoping to get closer to that price by continuing with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm confident you'll find this product valuable, and this price reflects its quality."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** Using phrases like ""I appreciate your interest"" and ""confident you'll find it valuable"" helps keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $90. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for higher offer:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round.
* **Selling to John is still not optimal:** While John offers a guaranteed $120, I'm optimistic about reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $85 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Let's meet at $90.  This gives us both a good deal and keeps the negotiations moving forward."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking to my ground:** I'm maintaining my previous counteroffer of $90. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, so I'm hoping to keep the pressure on.
* **Positive reinforcement:** I'm acknowledging Bob's willingness to compromise and reiterate that my offer is a good deal for both of us.
* **Framing the counteroffer:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a way to keep negotiations moving forward. This helps maintain momentum and avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still looking for a bit more profit, but I'm getting close to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $87, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $87 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, there's still some room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better offer:** I believe I can potentially get Bob to go a bit higher in the next round.
* **Selling to John is premature:**  While selling to John guarantees $120, I'm optimistic about reaching a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up.  $87 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $88.50?  That would make it a win-win for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 88.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising and staying firm:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's latest offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still keeping the price above my minimum.
* **Highlighting the win-win:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win for both of us, emphasizing that it's a fair price for both parties.
* **Urging closure:** I'm reminding Bob that we're nearing the end of the negotiation and suggesting a swift conclusion to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm not comfortable going above $87. I'm willing to make a final offer of $86.50. If you can meet me at that price, I'll buy the product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, the likelihood of getting a higher offer from Bob is decreasing.
* **Below minimum:** $86.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $120, which is significantly higher than any offer I've received from Bob.

While I would ideally prefer to close the deal with Bob, the risk of not getting a better offer and the time constraint make selling to John the most logical decision."
