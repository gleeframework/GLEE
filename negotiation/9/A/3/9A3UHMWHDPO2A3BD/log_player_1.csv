"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $100}

I'm starting with a relatively high price, but not too high, to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $70 because it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll wait for his next offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $85}

I'm making a counteroffer of $85, which is a bit higher than Bob's previous offer, but still lower than my original price of $100. Let's see how Bob reacts."
