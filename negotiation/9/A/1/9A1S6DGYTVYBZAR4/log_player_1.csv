"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to get him to bite.  I'll adjust my offer depending on his response, but I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  I'll counter with a lower offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $13,500 for this product.  This is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,500, which is still a significant profit for me. This is a compromise, but I'm still firm on my minimum price.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary.  I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject it and see if I can push him a little further.  I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer, but I'll be ready to walk away if he doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still a little short of where I need to be.  How about $13,250?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal without further delay.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

I'm offering $13,250 as a compromise. It's a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still a good deal for him, considering he values the product at $12,000. I'm hoping he'll accept this, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and would like to counter with a price of $13,100. I hope this proposal is acceptable and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,100 is getting very close to my desired price. While it's still slightly below my minimum, I'm running out of rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely, so I'm going to accept his offer. It's a good compromise that allows me to make a decent profit and close the deal."
