"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Based on my understanding of its potential, I'm asking $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price, which can help Bob feel more comfortable with the initial offer. 
* **Potential:**  I'm highlighting the potential of the product to encourage Bob to see its value.
* **Openness:**  I'm ending with an open-ended question (""Let me know your thoughts"") to invite a response and keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 seems a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is offering the minimum acceptable price for me ($800,000). 
* **Time is Money:**  I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate.  I have limited rounds, and I'm not sure if Bob will continue to increase his offer.
* **Guarantee:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me the minimum I'm willing to sell for.  

**Important Note:** While it's tempting to try to get a higher price, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for a slightly better offer. This decision is based on the goal of maximizing my earnings with a 10-round limit."
