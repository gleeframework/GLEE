Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) as possible while still ensuring a significant profit above our minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties (John) creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's highly motivated, allowing you to potentially secure even more. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes Alice is confident in John's guaranteed purchase at $1,200,000. If there's any risk of John backing out, a lower initial offer to Bob might be wiser."
