{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Above My Minimum:** The offer is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price ($100), ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $100, so I'm not pressured to accept any offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming higher. There's room to negotiate, and I believe Bob might be willing to go a bit higher. Rejecting his offer gives me a chance to counter and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob. How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50?"",
""product_price"": 112.50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price directly in the middle of our previous offers, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm not dropping my price too drastically, signaling that I still believe in the product's value.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer keeps the price above my minimum while still being enticing enough for Bob to potentially accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $111? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Gains vs. Risk:** While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $111 is already very close to my initial asking price.  
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale entirely. The difference between $111 and a potentially slightly higher offer isn't significant enough to risk losing the sale to Bob.
* **Profitable Outcome:** Accepting this offer still nets me a profit well above my minimum acceptable price."
