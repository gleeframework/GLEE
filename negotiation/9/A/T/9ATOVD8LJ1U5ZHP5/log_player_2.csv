Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I can do $85, which is the lowest I can go. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable with $77. I can do $82.50, which is a bit closer to the original price, but still a fair compromise.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go below $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $82, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $82 secures a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of the price going up or missing out entirely by going to John."
