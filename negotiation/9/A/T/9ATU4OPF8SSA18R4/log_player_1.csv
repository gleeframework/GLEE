{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed. It also shows that I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this product.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,250. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial ask, I'm comfortable accepting this offer.  The risk of continued negotiation could lead to a lower offer or even a rejection, and I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether."
