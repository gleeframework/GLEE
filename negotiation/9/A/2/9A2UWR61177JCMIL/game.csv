"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to this amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I still believe that $8,000 would be a fair price given my current budget constraints. Would it be possible for us to meet at this amount?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,000 is still not a viable price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? This would be a good compromise, and we can both walk away satisfied. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position and appreciate the compromise. Given my budget constraints, I would like to stick to $8,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8000.0,Bob,6,
