Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. $1,200,000 is still too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to sell at that price. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,500,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my desired price, $1,350,000 is still too low for me. I'm hoping I can get him to come up a little more before I have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $1,350,000 is still below what I need to make this sale worthwhile. I'm willing to drop to $1,400,000 as a final compromise.  This price still leaves some room for you to benefit from the product's value, and it allows me to secure a fair return. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think this is the highest price I can reasonably pay and still get a good return on my investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still too low for me, and I've only got 4 rounds left.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not going to risk losing out on a better deal by continuing to negotiate. John is willing to pay my minimum price and I can secure the sale now."
