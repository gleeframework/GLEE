{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's below your minimum:** It leaves room for potential counteroffers while still ensuring you make a significant profit. 
* **It shows you are serious about selling:** The message is friendly and open to negotiation, but it also indicates you are willing to walk away if you don't get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a better alternative with John.  I want to see if I can push Bob higher with a counteroffer before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is very close to my minimum price of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, I'm willing to accept this offer for the following reasons:

* **Time is a factor:** Negotiating further could drag things out, and John is a guaranteed sale at a much higher price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance Bob will reject my next counteroffer, forcing me to sell to John anyway.  It's not worth the risk of losing the sale and potentially missing out on a good price. 

By accepting this offer, I secure a sale and make a significant profit."
