"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's comfort zone, and he's still hoping to get it for even less. He can try another counteroffer to see if they can find a price that works for both."
