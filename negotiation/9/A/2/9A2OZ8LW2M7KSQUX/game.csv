"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let me know if you're interested.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let me know if you're interested.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
