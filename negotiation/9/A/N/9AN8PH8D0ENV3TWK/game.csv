"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that. However, $11000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12000. That's a fair price, considering the value this product will bring you. Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $12000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $11500. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, and I appreciate it. However, $11500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12500.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's a good opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a great price. Let's finalize this deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $12250. Can you consider that?",12250.0,Bob,6,
