{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $10,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll try a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $10,500 is closer to what I was hoping for, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference at $11,000?  It's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $10,750. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $10,750 is a good price and it's getting closer to my desired value.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and ending up with only $10,000 from John."
