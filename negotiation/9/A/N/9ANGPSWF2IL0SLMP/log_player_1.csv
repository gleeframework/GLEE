{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate but still leaves a significant profit for you.
* **It's below your minimum price:**  This ensures you don't immediately sell for less than what you're willing to accept.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  This helps keep the negotiation focused and avoids unnecessary ambiguity. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your assessment of his negotiating strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think it's a bit high, but I'm interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to consider his offer, you are in a strong position:

* **John is a guaranteed buyer:** You can sell to John for $1,200,000 anytime.
* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Accepting $950,000 would mean losing out on a significant amount of money. 
* **Negotiation can continue:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you keep the door open to potentially get a better deal through further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

You will proceed to the next round by sending Bob a counteroffer. It's crucial to find a price that balances maximizing your profit with keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,050,000?  This price still allows you a good margin and is closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is exactly halfway between your last offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000).  This approach shows you're open to compromise while still holding your ground.
* **Emphasizing value for Bob:**  The message points out that the price is still a good deal for Bob, giving him a clear benefit to accept.
* **Maintaining your minimum:** The price remains above your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you don't sell for less than what you're willing to accept. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer balances being firm with your pricing while signaling a willingness to negotiate. By presenting a fair and reasonable compromise, you increase the chances of securing a deal with Bob, while also ensuring you earn a good price for your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $980,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  You're in a strong position with John as a guaranteed buyer, so there's no immediate need to settle for a lower price.

**Reasoning:**

* **John is a guaranteed buyer:**  You can sell to John for $1,200,000 anytime, making this a safe option.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you keep the negotiation open. Bob might be willing to increase his offer further to secure the product.

**Next Steps:**

You will proceed to the next round by sending Bob a counteroffer. You can use this opportunity to try to bridge the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer, keeping in mind your minimum acceptable price and the potential of selling to John if a deal with Bob cannot be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $980,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down a little more, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,020,000? This offers you a good deal while still ensuring I get a fair return for my product."", ""product_price"": 1020000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between your previous offer ($1,050,000) and Bob's latest offer ($980,000). 
* **Emphasize Value:** The message reinforces the value of the product and highlights that the price is still a good deal for Bob. 
* **Maintain a Minimum:**  The price remains above your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you don't undervalue your product.

**Strategy:**

By continuing to offer a counterproposal, you demonstrate your willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a firm stance on your desired price. This strategy increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation with Bob.  If Bob rejects this offer again, you can reassess your options and potentially move closer to accepting his offer, or even consider selling to John if a deal with Bob seems unlikely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm not willing to go up to $1,020,000. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $990,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  You're in a strong position with John as a guaranteed buyer, so there's no immediate need to settle for a lower price.

**Reasoning:**

* **John is a guaranteed buyer:** You can sell to John for $1,200,000 anytime, making this the most profitable option.
* **Negotiations are stalled:** Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge significantly, and further negotiation may be unproductive.

**Decision:**

You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum acceptable price. Selling to John is the best course of action to maximize your profit and ensure a quick and sure sale."
