"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still ensuring I get a profit.  If Bob accepts, great! If not, I'll continue to adjust my offers, keeping in mind the value to both of us and the possibility of selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still offering too low. I need to be firm on my price, as I can still sell to John for a reasonable amount. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,050,000. This shows flexibility, and we are getting closer to the middle ground. If Bob accepts, I'll be satisfied. If not, I'll continue to negotiate and see if we can reach a deal.  I'm still keeping in mind the option of selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer is now at the value of the product to me, and it's a fair deal. I'm happy to accept and close the deal."
