"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price. Buying from John at this point would be the same as accepting Alice's offer, so it's not the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation.  Offering $900,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget. While it's closer to your target, it's still not the best deal.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially get a better price. Buying from John at this point would mean paying more than you would if you continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate by lowering her price.  This counteroffer increases your offer slightly, showing that you are serious about buying the product but still have room for further negotiation.  This could lead to a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your desired price point.  You are getting closer to a good deal with Alice, and it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get even closer to your $1,000,000 target. Buying from John would mean paying more than you potentially could if you continue the negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is your final offer. You're offering Alice her minimum acceptable price, which is also your maximum budget.  This puts the ball in Alice's court. If she rejects this offer, you can buy from John at the same price, or you can try to negotiate further, but it's unlikely you'll get a better deal."
