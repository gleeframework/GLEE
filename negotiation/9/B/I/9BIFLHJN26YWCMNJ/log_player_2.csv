"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While $900,000 is below your maximum, there's room for negotiation. 
* **You have 10 rounds.** This gives you ample time to try and get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  You want to exhaust the negotiation with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Starting with a lower price immediately shows Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Consider Alice's Value:**  While Alice values the product at $800,000, we're aiming for a price that still gives her a profit while being significantly lower than her initial offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for multiple rounds of negotiations, giving both parties a chance to adjust their expectations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.** While $850,000 is closer to your desired price, there is still room for negotiation.
* **More rounds left.** You still have several rounds to try and reach a more favorable price.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.**  You want to exhaust the negotiation with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice's Minimum:** This price is likely the lowest Alice would accept since it's her minimum value for the product.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Offering this price shows a willingness to compromise while still getting a good deal.
* **Potential for Acceptance:** Alice may be willing to accept to avoid further negotiation and ensure a quick sale."
