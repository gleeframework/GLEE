Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm sure we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate and creates a sense of potential savings.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that the deal is beneficial for both of us, framing it as a win-win scenario. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'll consider:

* **His Counteroffer:** How close is it to my desired price?
* **My Time Constraint:** How much longer am I willing to negotiate before selling to John?
* **My Risk Tolerance:** How much am I willing to compromise to close the deal?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this would mean a substantial loss for me.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While Bob is willing to negotiate, he's still far below my desired price point. There's room for further negotiation to reach a more favorable outcome.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum.  This gives me leverage to hold out for a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'll consider:

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'll aim for a price somewhere between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'll reiterate the product's value and why it's worth more than Bob's offer. 
* **Emphasizing Win-Win:**  I'll emphasize that finding a mutually beneficial price is my priority."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is simply too far below the true value of this product.  It's a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll recognize the benefit of paying a bit more to secure it.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've offered a price halfway between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I've reminded Bob that the product is valuable and that he's missing out on a significant opportunity if he doesn't pay a fair price.
* **Emphasizing Win-Win:** I've re-emphasized the desire for a mutually beneficial outcome. This creates a sense of partnership and encourages Bob to consider my offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response carefully. If he still refuses, I'll consider making a final counteroffer, but I'll also keep John's offer in mind. I need to weigh the risk of losing a deal with Bob against the certainty of a profit from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a sweet spot at $1,012,500. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,012,500 is only $12,500 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Limited Upside:**  Further negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, but the potential gains are small compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing the negotiation could drag on, potentially causing me to miss other opportunities or simply lose interest. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal. It's a good outcome, as it's close to my minimum and ensures a quick sale."
