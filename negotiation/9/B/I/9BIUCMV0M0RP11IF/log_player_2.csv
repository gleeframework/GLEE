Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is simply too far below the true value of this product.  It's a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll recognize the benefit of paying a bit more to secure it.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.
