Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum value of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible and work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm willing to push for a better price. I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I've thought about it and I'd like to propose $90 for the product. This would allow me to stay within my budget while still being fair to you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my desired price of $92.50. It's also above my minimum of $80 and represents a good compromise. Accepting his offer ensures I get a decent price and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer."
