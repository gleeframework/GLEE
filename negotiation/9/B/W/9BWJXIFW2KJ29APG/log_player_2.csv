Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value in this product.  To show you I'm serious about finding an agreeable outcome, I'll come down to $1,000,000 even.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is the best time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice's Limit:** She explicitly stated this is her final offer and the lowest she'll go. 
* **Matching John's Price:** Accepting this offer means you're getting the product for the same price as John would charge.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If you counteroffer again and Alice sticks to her word, you'll have to buy from John anyway. 

By accepting now, you secure the product at a reasonable price without risking a worse outcome."
