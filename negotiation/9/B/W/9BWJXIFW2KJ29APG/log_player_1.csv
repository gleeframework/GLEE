Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we start the negotiations at $500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product far exceeds $500,000. Let's meet closer to the middle - I'm willing to part with it for $1,250,000."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle around $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more. We're still significantly below my minimum and John's standing offer. It's worth countering again to explore if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value in this product.  To show you I'm serious about finding an agreeable outcome, I'll come down to $1,000,000 even.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I'm willing to go."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time to hold firm. I've come down significantly, and this offer matches John's guaranteed purchase price. It's a strong position to take - either Bob recognizes the true value and accepts, or I take John's offer with no loss."
