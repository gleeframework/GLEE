Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While I want to find a solution that works for both of us,  $850,000 is simply too far below market value for me to accept.  I'm willing to consider $975,000 as my final offer.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my strong desire to close this deal with you."",
