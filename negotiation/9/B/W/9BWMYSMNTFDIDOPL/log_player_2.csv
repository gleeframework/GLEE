"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, it's great to be connecting with you about this fantastic product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for us to discuss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,100,000 exceeds your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:** There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $1,200,000, indicating she's willing to sell for less.
* **Exploring counteroffers:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $1,025,000 remains above your maximum budget of $800,000.
* **Further negotiation is needed:**  There's still room to bargain since Alice has lowered her price, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Seeking a better price:** Rejecting allows you to counteroffer again and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price considering the value we both understand this product holds."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be upfront.  While I want to find a solution that works for both of us,  $850,000 is simply too far below market value for me to accept.  I'm willing to consider $975,000 as my final offer.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my strong desire to close this deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $975,000 is above your maximum budget of $800,000.
* **Limited negotiation room:** Alice has indicated this is her ""final offer"", suggesting further negotiations are unlikely to result in a lower price.
* **Secure a better deal:** Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum budget. This is a safer option as it avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a worse outcome."
