Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum value:**  You're aiming to get more than $150. 
* **It's not too high:** It's reasonable enough to encourage Bob to negotiate. 
* **It's paired with a friendly message:** This helps establish a positive tone.

**Important:**  We need to see Bob's response to your offer to make the next move.  I'll be ready to analyze his response and help you craft your next move!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $120. Would you consider reducing the price to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's still worth trying to get a bit more. Here's why:

* **You're in a strong position:** You have a backup buyer in John willing to pay your minimum. This gives you leverage.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's a chance Bob might be willing to go a little higher, especially if he truly values the product.

**Next Step:**  We need to craft a counteroffer to Bob.  Let me know what price you'd like to offer him and I'll help you with the wording."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm happy to come down a bit, but I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my original asking price. How about $175?  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** We're acknowledging Bob's offer but proposing a price that's still above your minimum.
* **Reasoning:** We offer a reason for the counteroffer (""closer to my original asking price""). 
* **Friendly tone:** We maintain a positive and engaging tone to keep the negotiation open. 

Let me know what Bob's response is, and we'll continue strategizing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your current offer. Would you be willing to consider $160 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $160 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Time is Money:**  Each round of negotiation takes time, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better offer.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If you keep rejecting, Bob might get frustrated and walk away, leaving you with the $150 offer from John.

**Conclusion:**  While you might get a bit more, the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit."
