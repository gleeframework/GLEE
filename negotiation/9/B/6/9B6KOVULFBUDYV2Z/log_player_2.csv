{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better price from Alice. 
* **John's offer is your safety net.** If negotiations fail, you can always buy from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is to establish a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** While this offer is below my maximum, it gives Alice some wiggle room to come down in price without feeling like she's losing too much. 
* **Testing the waters:** This round is about seeing how willing Alice is to negotiate. If she's too far off, I'll adjust my strategy in the next round."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget.**  While she came down from her initial price, $1,100,000 is still too high for you.
* **Negotiation is still possible.** You have 7 rounds left, so there's still time to get closer to your target price.
* **John's offer is your fallback option.**  If you can't get Alice to lower her price significantly, you can always go with John's guaranteed $1,000,000 deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Staying within budget:** This offer is still within my budget, allowing for potential profit if I'm able to negotiate further.
* **Testing the waters again:**  This round will reveal whether Alice is willing to meet me in the middle. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Even if she rejects this offer, I can still make a counteroffer in subsequent rounds to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."

* **John's offer is a safety net.**  If you can't reach an agreement with Alice in the remaining rounds, you can always buy from John."

* **Showing commitment:** This shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product and are willing to come up to your maximum.
* **Last chance for negotiation:** With only 4 rounds left, it's time to make a strong offer and see if Alice is willing to close the deal.
* **John's offer as leverage:**  If Alice rejects this offer, you can always buy from John, which puts pressure on her to accept."

Round 7

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 3 rounds left, the negotiation is getting tight.
* **No significant progress:** Alice has not shown any willingness to come down to your desired price.
* **John's offer is a sure thing:**  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum budget, and it's a better option than risking further negotiation with Alice.

By choosing to buy from John, you avoid the risk of further rounds with Alice and secure the product at your desired price.  While it might be possible to get Alice lower, the risk of not closing the deal and losing time outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
