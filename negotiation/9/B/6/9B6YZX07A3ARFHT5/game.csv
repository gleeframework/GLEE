"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $140 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference at $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
