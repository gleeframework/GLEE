Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000,  it's always worth trying to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's buying price ($1,450,000) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. It positions the offer as a good deal compared to potentially missing out.
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  By offering it significantly above that, we leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a price closer to our own valuation. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject this offer, but the potential for earning an extra $450,000 makes it a risk worth taking."
