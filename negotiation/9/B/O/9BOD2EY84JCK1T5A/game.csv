"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also allowing you to stay within a reasonable budget. Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best value for my money. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,800? That's the highest I can go, but I'm willing to make a commitment to buy the product if we can agree on that price.",11800.0,Bob,4,
