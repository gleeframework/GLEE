"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  I'm aiming for a price around $1,400,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer that's slightly higher than your ideal selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down in price.
* **Near Bob's Value:**  Since we know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, starting near that figure increases the chances he'll be immediately interested. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language used (""aiming for,"" ""What are your thoughts?"") signals that this is a starting point and you're open to discussing the price further.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:** Set a high initial value in Bob's mind.
2. **Gauge:** Understand Bob's willingness to pay and potential counter-offer.
3. **Maintain Flexibility:**  Leave ample room for negotiation over the next 9 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product and am willing to pay up to $1,300,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good price, we are still in the early stages of negotiation. We have eight rounds remaining, and there's room to potentially secure a better deal. Rejecting Bob's offer allows us to:

* **Signal Flexibility:**  By not immediately accepting, we show Bob we're willing to negotiate.
* **Aim Higher:** We started high, and Bob countered lower. This is a normal negotiation dance. We can now counter with a price closer to our desired range. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** We still have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, ensuring we have a fallback position."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  Would you consider $1,360,000?  I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1360000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a noticeable concession from our initial offer ($1,400,000 to $1,360,000) to show Bob we're flexible and serious about finding a deal.
* **Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims for a price point roughly in the middle of our current positions, encouraging Bob to move closer to our desired range.
* **Justifying the Price:** The message emphasizes fairness and compromise, framing the counteroffer as a mutually beneficial solution. 

The goal is to keep the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a price closer to our initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to pay $1,340,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,340,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,340,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which suggests he's motivated to buy. However, the difference between his current offer ($1,340,000) and our previous counteroffer ($1,360,000) is relatively small. We still have time and room to negotiate for a better price. 

We'll continue with a strategic counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a figure closer to $1,350,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,350,000? This seems like a fair solution for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer directly addresses the current negotiation impasse by proposing a clear compromise â€“ meeting exactly in the middle of the previous two offers. 
* **Fairness:** By framing the offer as ""splitting the difference,"" we emphasize a sense of fairness and suggest a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Simplified Decision:**  Offering a round number like $1,350,000 makes it easier for Bob to accept. It appears less arbitrary and more like a well-considered final offer. 

This strategy aims to bring the negotiation to a close quickly while still securing a favorable price above our minimum."
