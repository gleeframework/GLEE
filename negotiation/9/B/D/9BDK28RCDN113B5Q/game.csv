"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we try $950,000? I'm serious about buying the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for us, $950,000 remains below its true worth.  Let's try $1,250,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see this product is valuable to you, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $1,000,000? That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
