"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still quite a bit higher than your maximum valuation and significantly higher than her own valuation. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?"",
 ""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a much lower price.
* **Polite and Positive:** The message maintains a friendly and respectful tone, which is important for a successful negotiation.
* **Expressing Interest:**  Clearly stating your interest in the product encourages Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to her valuation, $85 is still above your ideal price. There's room for further negotiation. A counteroffer around $70-75 could potentially lead to a more agreeable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about $70?  That seems like a fair price that would work for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** This counteroffer lands almost in the middle of the current negotiating range ($60 - $85). 
* **Justification:** By suggesting $70 seems ""fair,"" it subtly implies Alice is being a little unreasonable if she rejects it outright.
* **Concise and Goal-Oriented:** The message is short, clear, and focuses on reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell the product for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $78. It's a great price, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $78
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $78 is within a reasonable range of your target price. While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings might not be worth the risk of Alice backing out.
* **Time Value:** Every round of negotiation takes time. Accepting now secures the product for a good price without further delay.
* **Avoiding John:**  Buying from John would mean paying the full $120. Accepting Alice's offer at $78 represents a significant saving."
