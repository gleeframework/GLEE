"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're considering.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is below its true market value. How about we meet halfway at $1,400,000? This recognizes its worth while still offering you a competitive price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $1,400,000 is slightly above my budget. Would it be possible for us to meet closer to my proposed price of $1,300,000? Perhaps we could find a middle ground?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
