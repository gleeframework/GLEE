"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay closer to my initial price. How about $1,050,000? This price allows for a fair deal for both of us. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to stay closer to your initial price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,025,000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,025,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still not quite there. Let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,040,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1040000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,040,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,020,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make a smart business decision.",1020000.0,Bob,6,
