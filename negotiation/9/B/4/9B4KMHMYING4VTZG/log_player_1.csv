Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will accept no less than $1,500,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000.

**Alice's Optimal Strategy**

Alice knows she has John as a guaranteed buyer.  Therefore, she should aim to get the highest price possible from Bob without losing him as a potential buyer.  

Here's a possible offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. It's a unique item, and I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Pricing:** The price of $1,450,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for Alice to profit considerably more than her guaranteed sale to John.
* **Messaging:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's uniqueness and value to Bob. This can help encourage him to consider the offer seriously, even if it's initially higher than he intended to spend. 

**Important Notes**

* This is just one possible offer. Alice could adjust her price slightly higher or lower depending on her assessment of Bob's negotiation style and how much she wants to push for a higher profit margin.
* There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If he rejects it, Alice can always fall back on her guaranteed sale to John."
