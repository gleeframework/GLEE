"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about $105?  That seems fair to us both.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to go to $108, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $108 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference at $104. If you're willing to go there, we can close the deal.",104.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $106, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",106.0,Alice,7,
