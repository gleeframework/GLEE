Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $50. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $85. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85. Accepting this offer gets you the product within your budget and avoids the risk of her increasing her price in later rounds."
