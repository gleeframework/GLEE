"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $50.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $50. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit much for my budget. How about $65? That's a fair compromise.",65.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $85. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
