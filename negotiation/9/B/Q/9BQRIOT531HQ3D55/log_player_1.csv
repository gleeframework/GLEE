Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, while still securing you a profit. 
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $119 feels more appealing than a flat $120, potentially making Bob more inclined to buy. 
 
**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. If he's a strict bargain hunter, he might reject it knowing your minimum is likely close to John's offer. However, this strategy aims to balance risk and reward."
