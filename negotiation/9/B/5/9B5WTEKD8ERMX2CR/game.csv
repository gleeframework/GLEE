"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $700000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's value and potential, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $900000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,,
