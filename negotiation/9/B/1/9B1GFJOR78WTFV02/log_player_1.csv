Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering the product at $12,000 positions it as a ""deal"" for Bob since it's significantly less than his perceived value of $15,000. 
* **Protecting Your Interests:**  While we aim high, the $12,000 offer still ensures a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Mentioning listing it publicly implies a time constraint, potentially encouraging Bob to decide quickly."
