"I'm interested in the product, but $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $1050000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1050000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $950000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $950000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1000000, but that's my absolute final offer.  This is a very valuable product, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
