"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the substantial benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer that leaves room for negotiation. This starting point is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, allowing you to gauge his interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:**  By emphasizing the ""unique value and potential,"" you aim to create a perception of high value in Bob's mind, potentially justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language used implies a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his initial perceived value, it's still considerably lower than your target price and John's standing offer.  You have room to negotiate further and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and willingness to negotiate. I've considered your perspective, and while I acknowledge your valuation, the product's inherent value and market potential warrant a higher price. I propose $2,100,000, which I believe represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** You acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and express appreciation for his willingness to negotiate, fostering a positive atmosphere.
* **Strategic Concession:** By reducing your price by $200,000, you demonstrate flexibility and willingness to meet Bob halfway. However, the concession is calculated to keep you well above Bob's initial offer.
* **Value Reiteration:** You subtly remind Bob of the product's broader value proposition, implying that your price reduction is already a significant compromise. 
* **Seeking Common Ground:** You aim to find a price point that satisfies both parties while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product. However, $1,950,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price, and significantly less than John's offer. You have the leverage to counter and push for a better deal.  You're aiming for a price closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're working with me on finding a mutually agreeable price.  To be frank, accepting anything below $2,000,000 would be difficult for me.  I believe the product's unique benefits warrant this price point.  If you're able to meet that figure, I'm ready to finalize the deal today."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** You're setting a clear boundary at $2,000,000, signaling that this is your bottom line. The language is firm but not aggressive, maintaining a positive tone.
* **Transparency:** By being transparent about your position, you build trust and potentially encourage Bob to be more forthcoming with his own limits.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By implying you're ready to close the deal immediately, you introduce a subtle sense of urgency, which may prompt Bob to make a decision. 
* **Leaving Room for a Counter:** While you've stated your desired price, you haven't explicitly rejected his last offer, leaving a small opening for him to counter with a slightly higher amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not willing to pay $2,000,000. I'm willing to compromise further and propose $1,900,000. I believe this is the maximum I can offer and still feel comfortable with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision point. Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is tempting, but you're still leaving a significant amount on the table compared to John's offer.  Bob stating this is his ""maximum"" could be a negotiating tactic, and you still have a few rounds to potentially close that $100,000 gap. The risk is that Bob walks away, but the potential reward for a counteroffer is worth the risk at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position and I want to find a way to make this work. How about we split the difference - $1,950,000, and we have a deal? This shows how committed I am to working with you."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer directly addresses Bob's statement that he won't pay $2,000,000. By suggesting they split the difference, you're demonstrating a willingness to compromise and find a solution.
* **Finality:** Presenting this offer as a ""take it or leave it"" proposition creates a sense of urgency and finality. 
* **Time Constraint:** You're running low on rounds, and it's becoming increasingly risky to continue pushing Bob further. This offer represents a strong balance between maximizing profit and mitigating the risk of Bob walking away."
