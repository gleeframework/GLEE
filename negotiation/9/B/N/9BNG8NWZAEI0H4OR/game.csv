"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not quite ready to give up yet, Bob! While $95 is a good offer, I was thinking more along the lines of $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but I'm reaching my limit. I'd be willing to do $98, but that's as high as I can go.",98.0,Bob,6,
