I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant profit for me.  I'm confident that Bob will be interested given the value of the product to him.  However, I'm also prepared to walk away if he's not willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent sum, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial asking price, but I'll be flexible to ensure a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm counter-offering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer, but still maintains a substantial profit for me. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with, and I'm unsure if further negotiation will lead to a better outcome.  Since John is willing to pay $1,000,000, it's the most sensible option to ensure I receive a fair price for my product."
