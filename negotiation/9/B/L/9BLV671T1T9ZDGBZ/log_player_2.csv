(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer is the same as John's, her message implies she might be willing to negotiate lower since she mentions its worth to *you*.  It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal before accepting the $1,500,000 price."
