"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low just yet.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're not willing to go as low as $850,000, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. Can you consider that?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I understand your perspective, $875,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer the product for $887,500. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value you'll get from this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",887500.0,Alice,5,
