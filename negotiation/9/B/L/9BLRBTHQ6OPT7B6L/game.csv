,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget concerns, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but $18,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Can you meet me at that price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
