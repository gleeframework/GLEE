Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's truly unique and I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable for your business.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but your asking price is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is a fair price given my needs. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.** I'm not willing to sell at such a loss.
* **I still have 9 rounds to reach a better agreement.** I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can secure a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Selling to John right now would guarantee $1,000,000, but I want to explore if a better deal with Bob is possible.**"

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the value of this unique product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $850000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.** While it's a slight improvement, it's not enough to justify selling at a loss.
* **I have 6 rounds left to reach a better agreement.** I'm confident that I can continue to negotiate and secure a higher price.
* **Selling to John would guarantee $1,000,000, but I'm determined to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.**  There's still potential to reach a mutually beneficial deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

* **I have 4 rounds left to reach a better agreement.** I'm confident that I can continue to negotiate and secure a higher price.
