Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** $100 is a good starting point as it's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation Potential:** This price allows for a possible counteroffer from Bob, giving you the chance to either accept a slightly lower price or make another counteroffer.
* **Plan B:** Knowing John is willing to pay $120 gives you a safety net. If the negotiation doesn't work out, you can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  How about $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Counteroffer is Necessary:**  I need to push for a higher price to maximize my earnings.
* **John is a Safety Net:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to reject Bob's low offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  By offering $85, I'm showing willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $85 is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility.  
* **Focus on Value:**  I emphasize that the price is still a good deal for Bob, reinforcing the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's closer to your asking price, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $120 I could get from John. 
* **Negotiating Power:**  I have a strong alternative buyer in John, which allows me to be more assertive and push for a better deal with Bob.
* **Potential for Better Price:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer again and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for you.  I'm willing to go down to $80. That's a fair compromise, and still a good price for you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** $80 is a significant compromise from my starting point, but it's still above my minimum and a reasonable price given John's offer.
* **Show Flexibility:** Demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway reinforces the negotiation process.
* **Final Push:**  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to sway Bob, as it's a good deal for both of us. If he rejects it, I'll likely sell to John."
