Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that we believe will greatly benefit your business.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1,200,000. We appreciate your interest in the product, but we're not quite willing to meet you at that price. We're willing to meet you halfway, so we're counteroffering at $1,500,000.
