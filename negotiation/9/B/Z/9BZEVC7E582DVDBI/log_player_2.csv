"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product, but I have to be honest with you, I really need to get at least $180 for it. Would you be willing to consider paying that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you're willing to pay. John offers a much better deal at $120."
