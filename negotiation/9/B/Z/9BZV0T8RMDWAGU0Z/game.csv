"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $175. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for the unique value this product offers.",175.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $150 is your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $165. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for the product's value.",165.0,Alice,5,
