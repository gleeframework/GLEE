Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:**  This price is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It's a good balance between maximizing my potential profit and keeping Bob engaged.
* **Message:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel valued and increase the likelihood of a successful negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own, keeping in mind John's offer of $1,000,000 as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to commit up to $850000 at this time. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's better than his initial value of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and below the $950,000 I offered in the first round. 
* **John's offer is a strong fallback:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is more than Bob's current offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a better price.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before accepting. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'll need to carefully consider the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer and potentially losing the deal with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Given the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price is still fair for both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise but not too much:** I'm lowering my price from $950,000 to $900,000, showing willingness to negotiate. This price is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his range.
* **Highlighting value:** I remind Bob of the product's unique value to emphasize the value of the deal.
* **Positive tone:**  I maintain a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable and open to a successful outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great!  I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to assess whether his counteroffer is acceptable or if it's time to move on to John's offer of $1,000,000.  I'll consider the risk of further negotiation and the potential for a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I am unable to meet the price of $900000. I would like to propose an offer of $875000, which I believe is a fair compromise. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While he's moved closer to my price, $875,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John's offer is a sure thing:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than what I could potentially get from Bob after further negotiation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of continuing negotiation with Bob is that he might reject my counteroffer, leaving me with a lower price or no deal at all.  John's offer is a safer and more profitable option.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept John's offer and move on, as it's a much better deal than what I can currently achieve with Bob."
