Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aim high, but leave Bob with a potential profit margin.  
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you'll get at least $800,000.
* **The Offer:** $1,100,000 allows Bob to gain $100,000 in perceived value while you maximize your profit significantly beyond your $800,000 minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In a more realistic scenario, there might be back-and-forth negotiations."
