Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the waters:** A significantly higher offer of $1,200,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation.
* **Room for negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob pushes back, and you can potentially still secure a price significantly higher than your baseline of $800,000."
