"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500, which is a great price considering its worth. Let me know if you're interested!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to you:** You are willing to pay a maximum of $10,000, and Alice is offering it for $9,500.
* **John's offer is your fallback option:** While John's price is higher, it's still within your budget.

**Strategy:**  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with her or buy from John at your maximum price."
