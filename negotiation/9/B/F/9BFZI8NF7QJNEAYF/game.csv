"Alice, we're getting very close.  I understand your need for a profit, but $890000 is still stretching my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $860000, which is a significant improvement from my last offer and a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal now, as I'm concerned I may have to pursue other options if we don't reach an agreement soon.",860000.0,Bob,6,
