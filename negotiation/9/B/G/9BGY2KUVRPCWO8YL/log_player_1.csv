Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is significantly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, giving me some room to negotiate. It also sets a high bar, demonstrating the value I place on the product. I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to meet this price or if he will counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I want to see if I can push for a better deal. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but still staying above Bob's offer. This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $1,250,000, which is closer to my desired price and is higher than the guaranteed $1,000,000 I can get from John. This seems like a good deal, so I will accept it."
