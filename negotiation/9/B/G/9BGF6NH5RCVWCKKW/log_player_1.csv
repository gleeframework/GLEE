I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000. I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations."

I've decided to sell to John.  Bob's offers are getting too low, and while I'd like to get the maximum price, it's not worth risking further negotiations.  John is a sure thing at $15,000, which is my minimum."
