"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $150. Given its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe it's a great investment for anyone looking to enhance their experience. Considering its worth and the value it offers, I kindly propose a special introductory price of $140 for you. This is an exclusive opportunity to acquire the product at a slight discount, making it even more appealing. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and preferences. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice's offer of $140 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and it's a better deal than buying from John for $150."
