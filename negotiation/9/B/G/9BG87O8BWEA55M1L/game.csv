"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is the closest I can get to your offer while still meeting my minimum requirements. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
