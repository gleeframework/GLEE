Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $70 is too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $85, but I was really thinking more in the range of $75. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for more. It's better to secure the sale now than to risk a counter-offer that could lead to a lower price or even a failed negotiation."
