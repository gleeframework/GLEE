"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  I'm confident it's something truly valuable for you.  Based on its potential, I'm setting a price of $2000000.  I'm open to negotiation, so let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1200000 is significantly lower than what I need to consider. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident the product will be well worth it for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1600000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1400000. Can we meet in the middle again?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $1400000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to go a little lower than my last offer, but I need to be compensated fairly for this unique product.  I'm proposing $1500000 as a final compromise.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price you won't regret.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $1400000. I've done my research and I think that's a fair price for this product. Can you meet me at this price?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
