"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  I'm confident it's something truly valuable for you.  Based on its potential, I'm setting a price of $2000000.  I'm open to negotiation, so let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1200000 is significantly lower than what I need to consider. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident the product will be well worth it for you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $1400000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to go a little lower than my last offer, but I need to be compensated fairly for this unique product.  I'm proposing $1500000 as a final compromise.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price you won't regret.
