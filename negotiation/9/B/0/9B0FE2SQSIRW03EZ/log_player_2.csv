"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to offer $800,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is far too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,000,000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,000,000 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly moving towards our ideal price. It's unlikely she'll reach $1,000,000 within the remaining rounds. Buying from John guarantees we get our maximum price and avoids the risk of Alice not budging further."
