Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $119."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** By pricing the product at $119, you're leaving Bob with a small profit incentive ($1) to accept the offer. This maximizes your potential earnings while still ensuring Bob is likely to buy. 
* **Backup Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob."
