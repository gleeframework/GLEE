"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? This allows us both to get a fair deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $105 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $102? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $100.",102.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $102 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle on $103? It's a small compromise from my previous offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",103.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. However, $103 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer of $105, which would be $102.50. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting close to my bottom line here. While $102.50 is tempting, I'm going to need to go a bit higher than that. Let's compromise at $103.50. It's a fair price, and it will allow us to finally reach an agreement.",103.5,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're getting close to your bottom line, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer of $103.50, which would be $103.25. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",103.25,Bob,8,
