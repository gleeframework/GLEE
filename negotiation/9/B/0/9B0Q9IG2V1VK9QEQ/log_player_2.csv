{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. This should encourage Alice to negotiate and hopefully come down to a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my target price. Rejecting the offer gives me another chance to negotiate a lower price. I'll still consider buying from John if the price remains too high, but I want to explore all negotiation options with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate but staying firm within my budget. This middle ground should hopefully prompt Alice to reconsider and potentially meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above my budget, but we're getting closer.  Rejecting this offer gives me one more chance to negotiate a lower price. It's possible Alice might concede to my next counteroffer, especially if it's clear that I'm willing to walk away and purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer, and it's my maximum budget.  If Alice rejects this, I'll move forward with purchasing the product from John.  By making a clear and firm final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to accept."
