"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $95 for it. Thank you for considering my offer.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $98 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations.",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm very close to accepting, but $98 is still a bit below what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for considering my needs. I am willing to pay $97 for the product. This price aligns better with my budget while still offering a reasonable profit for you.",97.0,Bob,6,
