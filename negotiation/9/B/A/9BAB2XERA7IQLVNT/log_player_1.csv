Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I value the product at $15,000, so I won't go below that.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values it at $8,000, so I know I can't get the full $15,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** I'm offering $12,000, which is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **John as Backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer who will pay my minimum. This gives me leverage to potentially get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below my initial offer of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I have John as a backup buyer willing to pay $15,000, giving me a strong negotiating position. I can afford to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, potentially reaching a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My previous offer of $12,000 was rejected, so I'm willing to compromise slightly. $10,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $9,000.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm lowering my price, I'm still above Bob's value, giving me some negotiating power. 
* **John as Safety Net:**  I still have John as a backup buyer who will pay my minimum, giving me the confidence to continue negotiating.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  $10,000 is a more reasonable middle ground that could potentially lead to an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum of $15,000, but it's still a significant difference.
* **Risk of Further Lowering:**  If I continue to counteroffer, there's a risk that Bob will simply walk away, leaving me with nothing.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is my minimum. This eliminates any risk and ensures I receive a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob will take more time and effort, which I might not be willing to invest, especially when John provides a guaranteed higher price.

Therefore, selling to John is the best option to maximize my profit and minimize risk."
