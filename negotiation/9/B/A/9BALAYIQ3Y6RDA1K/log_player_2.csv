"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might prompt her to come back with a lower price, closer to her $800,000 valuation."
