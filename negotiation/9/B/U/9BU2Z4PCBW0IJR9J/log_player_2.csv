"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still above the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $12,000. A counteroffer of $13,000 is a reasonable starting point, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate but also demonstrating that he's willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice hasn't budged from her initial price of $14,000.  Bob should reject the offer and continue to try and negotiate a lower price. There's still room for Alice to move closer to Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate and has demonstrated a price point he's comfortable with. By offering $12,500, he's showing a genuine attempt to meet Alice halfway. This offer is also closer to Alice's perceived value, increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally moved closer to Bob's desired price. While $13,500 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, it's a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer and much better than buying from John. Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product within his budget and save $1,500 compared to John's price."
