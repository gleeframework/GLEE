"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for $1,200,000, saving him $200,000."
