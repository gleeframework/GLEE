"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a great deal for you as well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's significantly more than your $8,000 limit and even above Alice's own valuation. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is way outside my budget.  I'm interested, but I'd need to see it closer to $6,000 for me to consider it seriously."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This offer is significantly below both Alice's valuation and your own limit.  This tactic aims to:
    * Gauge Alice's flexibility.
    * Establish a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  Even if Alice completely rejects this offer, there's plenty of room to move upwards towards your $8,000 limit.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and honest about your budget limitations while still expressing interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think it's a great deal for you as well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $9,000 is still above your $8,000 maximum. You have room to negotiate further and try to get closer to your target price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Progress:** This counteroffer continues to move the price closer to your $8,000 limit while still leaving you some wiggle room. 
* **Compromise Language:**  Phrases like ""meet in the middle"" and ""working with me"" reinforce a spirit of negotiation and compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is:
    *  Below your maximum, giving you some bargaining power.
    *  Above the midpoint between your initial offer and Alice's current offer, showing significant movement on your part."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer the product to you for $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $8,200, which is above your $8,000 maximum. While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely. At this point, John's offer of $8,000 is your best option to stay within your budget."
