"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a great deal for you as well.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is way outside my budget.  I'm interested, but I'd need to see it closer to $6,000 for me to consider it seriously.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think it's a great deal for you as well.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer the product to you for $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,5,
