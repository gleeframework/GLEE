Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is above your minimum, but still leaves room for a potential compromise. It also expresses confidence in the product's value to Bob, which could make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your ideal price.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open for a potential better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
