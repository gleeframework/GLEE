Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is simply too high for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that allows for some profit for you while remaining within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous offers. Let's settle at $950,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire the product within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum threshold. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
