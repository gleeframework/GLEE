"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is simply too high for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that allows for some profit for you while remaining within my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous offers. Let's settle at $950,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire the product within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
