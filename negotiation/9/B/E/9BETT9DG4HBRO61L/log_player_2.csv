Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, so I'll meet you at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $10,000.  Would you be open to $9,750? It's a firm offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,500. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'll meet you at $10,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting the offer of $10,250 secures a significant savings compared to John's price and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
