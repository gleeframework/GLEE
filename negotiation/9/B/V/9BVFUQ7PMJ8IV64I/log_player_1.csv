"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  It's a fair price considering its potential, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product. I understand its potential value, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $12000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is the minimum I am willing to accept for the product.  It's better to sell to Bob at $12,000 than to John at the same price, as I'm preserving the possibility of future negotiations with Bob if the need arises."
