I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not satisfied with it. I want to try to get closer to my initial price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm still aiming for a price higher than my minimum but acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay only $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to counteroffer again, the risk of further lowering the price and ultimately getting a lower price than John's offer is too high. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, so it's the safest and most secure option."
