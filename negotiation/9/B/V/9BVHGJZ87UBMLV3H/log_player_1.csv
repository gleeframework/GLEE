"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  I'm confident the product is worth at least that much to me, and I'm hoping to get as much as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, but I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more,  I'm happy to accept this offer. I've reached the minimum I'm willing to settle for, and continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the deal completely.  Selling to John for $8,000 is a viable option, but I'd rather avoid that if possible."
