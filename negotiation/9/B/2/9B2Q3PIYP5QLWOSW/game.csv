"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $20000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $17500?  This would allow me to make this deal work while still ensuring the value of the product is respected.  Let me know what you think.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $17500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12500? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'd be happy to make a deal at that price.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12500 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $14000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows me to move forward with the deal.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget limit, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but I don't think I can stretch any further. Can you meet me at $13000?",13000.0,Bob,6,
