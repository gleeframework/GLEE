Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $100 is more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $100 is less than the $120 Bob values the product at, so he has room to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is friendly and to the point, stating the price directly. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum price.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer to keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $85? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
