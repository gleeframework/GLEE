"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,400,000. This takes into account the product's unique benefits and future potential for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible price point. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects my desire to close this deal while ensuring a fair valuation for this unique product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still struggling to justify $1,300,000. How about $1,200,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to make this purchase. Let's try to reach an agreement at this point.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
