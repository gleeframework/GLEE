Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000**, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below the product's worth to Bob ($15,000)**, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and concise message** that leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I consider a fair price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
