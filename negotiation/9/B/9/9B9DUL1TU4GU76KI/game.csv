"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, considering my budget and the current market situation, $1,025,000 is still beyond my means. I am prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
