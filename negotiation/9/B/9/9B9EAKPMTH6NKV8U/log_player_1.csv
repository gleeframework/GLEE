Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the features of the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still confident in the product's value beyond $1,100,000. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This offer reflects a significant price reduction on my end while hopefully remaining reasonable for you."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,225,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the features of the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a million, it's clear he's unlikely to meet your minimum acceptable price.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
