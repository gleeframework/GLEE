"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the features of the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. While I appreciate your perspective on the price, I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,350,000? This reflects some flexibility on my end while still acknowledging the product's true worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the features of the product. Can we discuss further?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still confident in the product's value beyond $1,100,000. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This offer reflects a significant price reduction on my end while hopefully remaining reasonable for you.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,225,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the features of the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
