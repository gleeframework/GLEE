"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get closer to your target of $1,000,000."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is within your budget and a significant improvement from her previous offer.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject your counteroffer again, and you'd end up buying from John at $1,000,000.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product for a price you're comfortable with."
