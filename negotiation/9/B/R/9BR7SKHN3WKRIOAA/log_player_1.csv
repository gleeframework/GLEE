Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,500,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial offer:**  Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation. Even if Bob negotiates down, Alice is likely to secure a price significantly higher than her minimum ($1,200,000). 
* **Highlighting exclusivity:**  Phrasing the offer as ""exclusive"" adds a sense of value and urgency for Bob to consider.
* **Open for discussion:** Alice's message keeps the conversation open, inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation.

**Important:** While John represents a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, Alice maximizes her potential profit by aiming higher with Bob initially."
