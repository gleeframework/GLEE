"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to budge. I'm also trying to build rapport and make him feel like this is a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $90 is still too low. I'm hoping to push him further towards my desired price, but if we can't reach an agreement, I'm ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $90 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is a significant compromise. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, but $110 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While we're getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, $95 is still too low. I'm hoping to push him further towards my desired price, but if we can't reach an agreement, I'm ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we might be at an impasse here.  While I appreciate your interest, $95 is just not enough for me to justify selling. I'm willing to come down to $105, but I'm not going any lower.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $98 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $98 is still too low. I'm hoping to push him further towards my desired price, but if we can't reach an agreement, I'm ready to sell to John. I'm starting to run out of time, so I need to get more aggressive in my negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm running out of time here.  I'm going to make one final offer: $102. This is a significant compromise for me, but I believe it's fair given the value of the product. If you're truly interested, I urge you to accept. Otherwise, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 102}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to sell to John. I'm running out of time, and Bob is not budging on his price.  While $92 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's best to take the guaranteed $150 from John and avoid risking getting stuck with a much lower price."
