**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than your target price. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get closer to your desired range."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range where there's room for negotiation. I believe a price of $750,000 is a fair starting point, considering both of our desired outcomes."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, $850,000 is still higher than my target. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can push for a price closer to my desired $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate. This round, I'm going to make a final counteroffer at my target price of $800,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both parties.  If Alice rejects it, I'll buy from John at $800,000 to guarantee I get the product."
