Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
