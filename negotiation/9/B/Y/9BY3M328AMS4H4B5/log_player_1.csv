I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation, but still gives me a profit on my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm curious to see what Bob's reaction is and if he's willing to enter negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,350,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is slightly above my minimum value of $1,200,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a reasonable offer and I'm willing to accept it."
