"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $14,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a better price, especially since we have plenty of room below our $15,000 maximum and know Alice's product is worth less to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $14,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:** By offering $12,000, we're aiming close to Alice's perceived value of the product. This sets a strong anchoring point for the negotiation. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating our price point.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  While we've gone straight for a good price, there's still space to negotiate upwards if Alice completely rejects our initial counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to negotiate, which is good. However,  $13,250 is still too high. We've got time, so let's keep negotiating towards a price closer to $12,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $12,500? That feels like a good compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($13,250) and our previous counteroffer ($12,000). This shows flexibility.
* **Clear Target:** $12,500 is a good price point, leaving us with some savings while likely being acceptable to Alice.
* **Direct Language:**  The message is straightforward and emphasizes the collaborative nature of finding a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly interested in this product and I want to see us make a deal. $12,500 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to do $12,800?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $12,800 is a solid price, saving us $2,200 from our maximum and $700 from John's offer.
* **Alice is Motivated:** Her message indicates she's eager to close the deal. 
* **Limited Upside:**  Pushing for another $300 is unlikely to succeed and risks pushing Alice away. It's better to secure a good deal now."
