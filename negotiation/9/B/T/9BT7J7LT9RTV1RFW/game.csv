"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a fair price for this product is $85. I'm willing to give you a small discount from my original price of $90, but I need to make a profit.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to pay $78 for the product. Can you consider that?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit higher than my last offer, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can meet you at $82. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",82.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit higher. I'm willing to pay $79 for the product. Can you meet me there?",79.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $80, which is my minimum price. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and it's the lowest I can go.",80.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to your minimum price, and I think we're almost there. I'm willing to pay $79.50 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",79.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I've already met you at my minimum price of $80 in the previous round. I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm starting to think that maybe we're not meant to do business together.",80.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to pay $80, but I'm willing to pay $79 for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere for the product. I've already had an offer from another seller for $100, so I think I'll have to take that one.",79.0,Bob,10,
