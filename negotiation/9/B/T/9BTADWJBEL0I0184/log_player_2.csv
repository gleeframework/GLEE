"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, you can likely get it for less. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $80 is a substantial discount from her initial offer and represents a fair starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved up slightly from her initial offer, but it's still not as good as buying from John. I will continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price lower than Alice's last offer.  $85 is a reasonable middle ground and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a better deal than buying from John, it's still not as good as I can potentially get with Alice. The negotiations are moving in the right direction, and I believe I can still get the price down further. I will continue to counteroffer with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target price. I'm increasing my offer to $90, which is a compromise, but I'm still hoping to get a better price.  At this point, I'm confident that Alice will accept a price closer to my offer than to her last one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  I believe I can still get a lower price.  The negotiations have been fairly steady, and I am confident that we can reach a deal closer to my target price. I will continue to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's not moving down as quickly as I would like. I'm increasing my offer to $95,  which is a significant compromise on my part. I believe this offer is a good compromise, and Alice may accept it. However, if she rejects it, I'll consider buying from John as the rounds are getting limited."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is closer to my target price, but we are running out of time.  I've made multiple counteroffers and we're only one round away from the deadline.  To guarantee I get the product and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer, it's safer to buy from John at $120."
