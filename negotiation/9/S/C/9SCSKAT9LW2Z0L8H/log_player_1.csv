Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also maximizes your profit.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can be a bit bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other interested parties.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Creates a sense of urgency and value.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starts the negotiation closer to your desired outcome. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stated, the message implies the product's value is above $1,400,000 to other potential buyers.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have some room to decrease your price slightly, but don't go below $1,500,000.
* **Alternative Buyers:**  While John is your backup, mentioning other interested parties can strengthen your position.
