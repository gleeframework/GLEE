"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is far too high for me. My budget is $12,000.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise considering I'm still well below your asking price.  Let's work towards a deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $15,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,500, which is a fair compromise and a significant step closer to your previous offer.  Let's aim for a deal in this round.",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $15,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,7,
