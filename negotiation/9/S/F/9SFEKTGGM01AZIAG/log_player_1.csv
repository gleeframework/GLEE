Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $10,500.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum price of $10,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. I still have 8 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for this product.  This is a very fair price, considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I want to see if I can push him a bit further by making a counteroffer.  I've got 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're eager to make a deal, but $10,750 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,875.  This price reflects both of our needs and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10875}
