{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,700,000. This is a starting point for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer. He's dropping the price by $300,000, which is a significant reduction. This will likely prompt Alice to counter with a more reasonable offer. It's important to be aggressive in the first few rounds to establish a lower negotiation range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still potentially do better. He's already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing that he's willing to meet Alice halfway. This counteroffer is still below Alice's last offer, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward.  Bob is trying to find a middle ground while still saving some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's already demonstrated a willingness to pay close to his maximum price, and Alice has shown a willingness to come down. There's still room to try and squeeze out a better deal, and the risk of buying from John is always present."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

Bob is making his final push. This offer is his absolute maximum, and he's hoping Alice will accept it.  He knows that if she rejects it, he can always buy from John. This is a high-risk, high-reward move, but Bob is confident that he can get a deal done."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already reached his maximum price, and Alice has shown a willingness to come down to a price that's only slightly above his value for the product.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, and Bob runs the risk of losing out on the deal altogether.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
