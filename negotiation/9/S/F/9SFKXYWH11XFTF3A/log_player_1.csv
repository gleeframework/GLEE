"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum desired value.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $150 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I believe the product is worth more, and I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $175. This is a compromise that acknowledges Bob's initial offer while still allowing me to get closer to my desired value. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price for Bob, and we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and I'm willing to accept $160.  There's a risk of further negotiation, but I'm concerned about running out of rounds and having to settle for the minimum with John.  This offer secures a decent profit, and I'd rather close the deal now."
