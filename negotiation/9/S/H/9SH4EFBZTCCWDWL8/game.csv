"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, and I do see its potential. However,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring immense value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,320,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its worth to you and my initial offer of $1,400,000. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,320,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to me and your original asking price.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1280000.0,Bob,4,
