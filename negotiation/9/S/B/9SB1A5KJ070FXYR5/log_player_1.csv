Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects a fair price considering its value and my budget constraints. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
