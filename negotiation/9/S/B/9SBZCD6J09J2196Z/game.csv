"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a significant value for you. This price allows for a mutually beneficial deal, and I believe this product would be a great addition to your operations. Let's try to make this work!",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still working within a tight budget and would like to keep the price at $800,000 if possible. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
