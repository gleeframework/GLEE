,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. The product is worth a lot to me, but I'm a savvy buyer and I'm looking to get the best deal possible.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $1,000,000 is a strong offer, this product offers significant value beyond that.  I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
