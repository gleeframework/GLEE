Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $1,000,000 is a strong offer, this product offers significant value beyond that.  I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.
