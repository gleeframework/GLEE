"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000? I think that's a fair price.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low for me.  It's clear you see value in this product, so let's work towards a price that is fair for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment.  Would you consider $700,000? That seems like a reasonable compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
