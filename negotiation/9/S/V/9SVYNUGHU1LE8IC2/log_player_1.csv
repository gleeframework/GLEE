Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to part with it for $119."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price higher than $120. 
* **Time Value:** While I have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays.

Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, there's a chance for a counter-offer that still benefits me more than selling to John directly."
