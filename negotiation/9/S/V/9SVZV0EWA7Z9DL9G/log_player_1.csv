Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $18,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing above my minimum.
* **Confidence:** A strong initial offer can signal the product's value and my confidence in it. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's financial situation or how much he might be willing to pay. If I had more insights into Bob's profile, I could adjust my offer accordingly."
