Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  To be frank, $700,000 is too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,000,000.  This is my absolute bottom line, as it represents a significant discount to its true value and potential. Let me know if this works for you.
