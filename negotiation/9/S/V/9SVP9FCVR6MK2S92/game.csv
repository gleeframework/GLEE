"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects.  I could consider a price of $1,300,000.  This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but  $1,300,000 is still significantly higher than what I had in mind.  Perhaps we can find a middle ground.  Would you be willing to accept $700,000? I feel this is a fair offer considering its true value to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  To be frank, $700,000 is too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,000,000.  This is my absolute bottom line, as it represents a significant discount to its true value and potential. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
