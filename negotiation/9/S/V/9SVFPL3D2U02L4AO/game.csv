"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $950000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this price is still a fair reflection of the product's value, and it would allow me to make a more comfortable purchase. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825000.
