{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than $8,000, giving Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $9,500 is still above your minimum of $10,000, so you're not losing money.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects, you can still negotiate. 

By starting high, you give yourself the best chance of getting as close to your desired price as possible."

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob a bit more and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
