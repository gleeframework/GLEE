"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate your offer, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $120. Would you be able to accommodate this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to budge from his $120 offer.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Bob. I'll take the sure thing."
