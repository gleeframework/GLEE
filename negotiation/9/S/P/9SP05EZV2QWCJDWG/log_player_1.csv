Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get a higher price, but I'm also prepared to potentially accept a counteroffer from Bob or move on to John if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I will counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $90 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105?  This would still give you a great deal on the product, and allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we settle at $97? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $97 is close to my ideal price and significantly higher than what John is offering.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $105, I don't want to risk losing a deal and ending up with only $80. Accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this situation."
