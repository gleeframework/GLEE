Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is still too far below my value. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be compensated fairly.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of time, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to hold firm for now and see if I can get Bob to budge."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000.  We're so close to a deal, though!  Let's compromise one last time. I'll meet you halfway at $12,500.
