"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $7,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to settle for $8,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $8,750?",8750.0,Alice,5,
