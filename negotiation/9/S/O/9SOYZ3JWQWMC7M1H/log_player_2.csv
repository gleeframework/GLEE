You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000, and both Alice and John are selling the product for exactly that price, there is no advantage in accepting Alice's offer.  You can simply reject her offer and buy from John."
