Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing our profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing we have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John gives us leverage. We're not desperate to sell to Bob below our minimum. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between attracting Bob with a seemingly good deal while still maximizing our potential profit."
