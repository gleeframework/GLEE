"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  However, $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm looking for $10,500. This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product to your business. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $9,500. Would that be feasible for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference and settle on $9,800.  This will give us both a fair deal and hopefully move us forward towards a final agreement. ",9800.0,Alice,5,
