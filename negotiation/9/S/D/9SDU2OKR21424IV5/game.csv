"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the significant value the product holds, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
