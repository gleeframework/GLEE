Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's tempting to accept Bob's offer, but $8,000 is far below my minimum value for the product. I'll keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $9,000?  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $8,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob to see if I can get a better price.  I have the option of selling to John for $12,000, but I'm going to see if I can do better with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $8,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower the price to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've been considering your proposal carefully, and I would like to suggest a price of $9,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close enough to my desired price point, and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, I might lose the chance to sell to him at all. It's better to secure a sale at $9,000 than to risk ending up with nothing or having to sell to John for $12,000."
