It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We're approaching the limit:**  Alice is clearly signaling she won't go much lower. Continuing to push for a small discount might backfire.
* **Good deal:**  $8,100 is a significant savings compared to John's $10,000 price.
* **Time is a factor:**  We've already used 7 rounds.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice gets frustrated and the deal falls through."
