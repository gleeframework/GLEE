"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $7,000? I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $7,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $8,000.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I understand this is as low as you'd like to go,  $8,200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Could we settle at $7,800? I feel that's a fair offer considering your valuation and my budget.",7800.0,Bob,6,
