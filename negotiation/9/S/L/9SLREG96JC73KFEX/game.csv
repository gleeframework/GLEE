"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",140.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $140 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'd be happy to purchase it for $130.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $140 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth the investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $135. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's a fair compromise.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $135.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $132?  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal.",132.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. I'm willing to throw in a small bonus, though - I'll include a premium service package that's worth $10. This will bring the total value to $145, which is still below your original offer of $150. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $135 plus the bonus.",135.0,Alice,5,
