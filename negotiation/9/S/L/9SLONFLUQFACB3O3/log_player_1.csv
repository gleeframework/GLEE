Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $100 would be a fair price for this item. Would you be able to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

Explanation:  Bob is clearly anchored at $100 and unlikely to budge.  It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting a worse deal."
