"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $750,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product at a discounted price. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,
