"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $750,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product at a discounted price. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your constraints, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $675,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $725,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.
