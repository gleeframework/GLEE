"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $92.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That seems fair to both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
