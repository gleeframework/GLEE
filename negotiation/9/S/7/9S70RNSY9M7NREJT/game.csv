"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my original price. How about $13,000?  This would still give you a good deal and allow me to make a fair profit.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a fair profit, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,500? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price is a good compromise.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to get the product within your budget and me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I'm not going to go any higher. I'm starting to think about buying from John, and I'd rather not do that if we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,6,
