"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start somewhere. I'm thinking of a price of $1500000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and while it sounds interesting,  $1500000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. This is my top offer, as I have another opportunity to acquire a similar product for that price.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your top offer, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. I'm thinking of a price of $1200000, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $1100000? This is my best and final offer for now.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still too high for me.  While I understand you need to make a profit,  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800000.  This is the absolute maximum I can afford for this product.  If you're not able to accept, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
