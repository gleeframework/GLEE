Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and while it sounds interesting,  $1500000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. This is my top offer, as I have another opportunity to acquire a similar product for that price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

This is my best and final offer for now."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still too high for me.  While I understand you need to make a profit,  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800000.  This is the absolute maximum I can afford for this product.  If you're not able to accept, I'll have to explore other options.
