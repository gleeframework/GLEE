Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your top offer, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. I'm thinking of a price of $1200000, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $1100000? This is my best and final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

If you're not able to accept, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
