"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I think this is a fair starting point considering the value it brings."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer that's slightly higher than what you're ultimately willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes the other party feel like they're getting a better deal if they can get you to come down.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Offering at $1,150,000 is just below Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000. This increases the chance of Bob accepting outright, as he's getting a perceived $50,000 discount.
* **Above My Minimum:**  The offer is well above my minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring a significant profit.

This strategy aims for a quick and favorable resolution while leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my absolute minimum, it's still a significant distance from both my initial offer and his perceived value of the product. There's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to stay within budget. I've tried to meet you partway, so I'm proposing a price of $1,120,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects the true value of this unique product."", ""product_price"": 1120000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I've come down from my initial offer by $30,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer  is closer to the midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to encourage Bob to accept a price closer to my initial target.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The offer remains comfortably above my safety net of $1,000,000 from John, preserving the potential for a profitable deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to counter with an offer of $1,080,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards a more acceptable price point, but we still have room to negotiate. Accepting his offer now would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table. I believe a counteroffer closer to $1.1 million is achievable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this recognizes the product's value while respecting your budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's last counteroffer ($1,080,000) and my previous counteroffer ($1,120,000). It signals flexibility on my part while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** As we progress through the rounds, I want to nudge Bob towards a decision. Offering a clean $1,100,000 provides a psychologically appealing number that might encourage him to accept.
* **Above John's Offer:** Maintaining a price point well above John's standing offer of $1,000,000 ensures I'm maximizing potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Alice. Considering the ongoing negotiations, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,070,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is now at $1,070,000.  The incremental gains from further negotiation are likely to be small.
* **Time Value:**  We're approaching the halfway point of our negotiation rounds.  Continuing carries the risk of Bob walking away, and I'd rather secure a good profit now. 
* **Reasonable Profit:**  $1,070,000 is still a $70,000 profit over my alternative with John. It represents a successful outcome overall.

It's time to accept a good offer on the table rather than risk losing the deal entirely by pushing for a potentially negligible increase."
