"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price higher than my minimum.  It's important to start high and see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, it's not my ideal price. I want to try to get closer to my initial $15,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $12,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still above my minimum. Hopefully, this will be a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to keep negotiating, Bob's offer of $10,500 is a significant improvement from his previous offer. It's only $500 less than my initial offer and much closer to my target than John's offer. I'll accept this deal and avoid the risk of losing a sale entirely."
