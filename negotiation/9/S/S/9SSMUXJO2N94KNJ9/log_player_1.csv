"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest and give me a sense of his potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round.  I'm not ready to settle yet, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that's closer to his last offer but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise, while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is very close to my desired price.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal entirely is growing. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
