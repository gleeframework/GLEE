Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a great deal for you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,500,000.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. 

You start with a strong offer slightly below your guaranteed price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer while ensuring you make a significant profit. 

**Why this strategy:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** By starting high, you aim to get as close to your $1,500,000 minimum as possible from Bob. 
* **Strong Position:** Knowing John will buy at your desired price gives you leverage in the negotiation. You are not desperate to sell below your minimum.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's financial situation or how badly he needs the product. If you had more information, you might adjust your strategy."
