"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit, and $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
