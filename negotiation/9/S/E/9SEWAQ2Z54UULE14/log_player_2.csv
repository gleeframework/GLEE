Explanation:

Alice is holding firm at a price higher than John's offer. While she claims it's her final offer, there's no guarantee she won't negotiate further in a later round. However, every round carries the risk of Alice sticking to a price above $10,000.  

At this point, it's strategically better to take the guaranteed win. John's offer saves you money and ends the negotiation process."
