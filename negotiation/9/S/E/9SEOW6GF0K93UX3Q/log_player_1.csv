"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. This product has the potential to generate substantial returns, and I wouldn't be comfortable letting it go for less than $2,000,000. This is my final offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. How about $1,450,000? That's a strong offer considering I could go with another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

At this point, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk Bob not reaching an acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
