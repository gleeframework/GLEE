"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept Bob's offer, as it's below my minimum acceptable price. However, I also don't want to immediately sell to John. It's worth seeing if I can push Bob a little closer to my target price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. Let's meet halfway.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to achieve a reasonable return. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get closer to my goal of $1,200,000 by continuing to negotiate."
