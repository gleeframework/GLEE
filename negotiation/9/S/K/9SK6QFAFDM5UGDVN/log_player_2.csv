"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this valuable product.  It's something that I believe will be a great asset to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,400,000. Let's see if we can work from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. Let's meet halfway.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to achieve a reasonable return. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above my budget of $1,200,000.  While it's closer, I'm going to try to get a lower price.  I'm also concerned that if I accept this offer, I'll be left with very little room for negotiating with John in the future if the deal falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can agree."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, but still below Alice's latest price.  It shows a willingness to negotiate while staying within your budget.  Hopefully, Alice will recognize the potential for a deal and come closer to your price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly at my maximum budget.  While I would prefer to pay less, it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I can buy the same product from John for the same price.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product without further risk or delay."
