"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit high for me. How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it right away.",100.0,Bob,4,
