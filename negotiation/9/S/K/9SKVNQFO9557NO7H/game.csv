"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can cover my costs. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $105, just like I said before. Can we finalize the deal at this price?",105.0,Bob,6,
