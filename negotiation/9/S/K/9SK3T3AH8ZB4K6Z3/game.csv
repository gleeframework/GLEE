"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but given my budget constraints, I can only offer $9500 for the product.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000 to show you I'm serious about making a deal. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Given the value I place on the product, I would like to counteroffer at $10500. This feels like a fair compromise considering our previous discussions.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I recognize the value you place on the product, $10500 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10750. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. Considering our previous discussions and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10250 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating. However, $10250 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $10500 as a final compromise. This would be a good deal for both of us, and it would be a shame to miss out on this opportunity.  Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've carefully considered your latest offer and appreciate your flexibility. In light of our ongoing dialogue and my financial constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10300 for the product. I believe this represents a fair compromise that respects both our interests.",10300.0,Bob,8,
