Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that is:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  $140 is above your $120 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **Lower than Bob's perceived value:**  It leaves room for negotiation and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $130 is less than the initial offer, it's still above your minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's also likely that Bob is close to his maximum price, so trying to push for more could risk him walking away completely."
