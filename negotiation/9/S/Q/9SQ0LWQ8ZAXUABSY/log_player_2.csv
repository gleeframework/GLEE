# Alice's message: I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1280000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $1,280,000, he's getting a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,500,000. While he could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't go much lower, and he risks losing the deal."
