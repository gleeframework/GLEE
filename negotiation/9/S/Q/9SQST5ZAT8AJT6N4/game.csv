"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However,  $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground there.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product to you is undeniable, and  $1,100,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer. Let's try and find a middle ground â€“ how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we settle on $1,150,000? I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable to me, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
