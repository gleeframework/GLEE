"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your desired price range.** You're aiming to spend no more than $1,500,000, and Alice is starting at $1,350,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting the initial offer and counter-offering. 

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to your $1,000,000 target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product to you is undeniable, and  $1,100,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer. Let's try and find a middle ground â€“ how about $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your desired price range.**  You're aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000, and her new offer is $1,250,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, and you can likely get her down further.

**Next Steps:**

You should make another counteroffer, but aim a bit higher than your previous offer to show you're willing to negotiate.  A counteroffer of $1,150,000 would be a good starting point."
