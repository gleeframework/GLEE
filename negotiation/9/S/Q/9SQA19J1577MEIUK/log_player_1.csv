Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum value:** The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, so I won't sell it for less.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $1,000,000. This is my baseline.
* **Potential upside:**  By offering $1,500,000, I am trying to maximize my profit.  If Bob values the product at more than this, he'll accept. 
* **Risk assessment:**  There's a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, I'm willing to take that risk because even if he does, I'm still guaranteed to make a profit of $500,000 by selling to John. 

This strategy balances the desire for a higher profit with the need to secure a sale."
