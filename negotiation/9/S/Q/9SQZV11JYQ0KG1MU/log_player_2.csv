Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $850,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise a bit further.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This price still allows me to make a good profit, and I believe it's a reasonable starting point for further negotiations.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
