"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can offer you $150 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $150 matches the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I already have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay the same amount.  There's no benefit to risking further negotiation with Bob when I can secure the $150 immediately with John."
