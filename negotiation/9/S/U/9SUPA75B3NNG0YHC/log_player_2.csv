"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Bob starts with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a common tactic in negotiations to establish a lower starting point for negotiations.
* **Justified Reason:** Bob gives a reason for the counteroffer (budget) to make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Room for Compromise:** While $14,000 is Bob's ideal price, it allows for potential compromise in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget of $15,000. 
* **More negotiation room:** Bob can still try to get a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. He has a few rounds left and can continue to explore options.
* **Alternative option:**  Bob can also choose to buy from John at any point for $15,000, giving him a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** Bob is incrementally moving closer to Alice's price, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget.
* **Setting a limit:** Stating ""absolute limit"" reinforces the seriousness of his offer.
* **Seeking common ground:** The message focuses on finding a solution, rather than rejecting outright, making the offer seem more reasonable."
