"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to meet you halfway.  This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's make this happen.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work. How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this is a great deal for you. Let's work this out.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,800.  I think this is a fair deal for both of us.",7800.0,Bob,6,
