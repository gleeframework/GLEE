"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she is asking for $90. This is a good starting point, but I can try to get a better price.  I will reject her offer and try to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice is willing to go down to $87.5, which is closer to my target price of $80. It's still a bit more than I want to pay, but with only 7 rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiations. Accepting her offer is the best choice."
