"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($10,000).  This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Discount:**  $12,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $14,000. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to make a substantial concession.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $12,000 is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $10,000, leaving room for Alice to counter with a price closer to Bob's desired price.
* **Politeness:**  The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer, making the negotiation more amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, but that's my final offer.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $13,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's below his maximum budget of $15,000 and also a good compromise from his previous offer.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has clearly stated this is her final offer.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Alice backing out of the deal entirely.
* **Risk of Buying from John:** While John is also an option, buying from Alice at this price guarantees a lower price and avoids the risk of John potentially changing his price later."
