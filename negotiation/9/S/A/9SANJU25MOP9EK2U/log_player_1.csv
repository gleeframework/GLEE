Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's a chance to get Bob to buy it. Aiming for your full desired price makes sense.
* **Not Too High:**  Going much higher than $10,000 is unlikely to entice Bob when his perceived value is $8,000.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value and that Bob is getting a preferential opportunity. 

It's a delicate balance: trying to get Bob to bite while knowing you have a backup plan."
