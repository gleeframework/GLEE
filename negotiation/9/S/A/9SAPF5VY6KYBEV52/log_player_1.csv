I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable price for both of us - it's more than my minimum but less than Bob's maximum value. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I believe this is still a fair price, given the value of the product to both of us, and it might incentivize Bob to accept rather than going through another round of negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not convinced I can get him to go any higher. It's not worth the risk of another round of negotiations when I can sell to John for $12,000 right now. It's a guaranteed profit, and it's time to move on."
