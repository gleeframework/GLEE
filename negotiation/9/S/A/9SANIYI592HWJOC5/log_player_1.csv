{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my valuation. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both your valuation and his perceived value. There's plenty of room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. This reflects my strong belief in its value while acknowledging your perspective."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits the product offers. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob is now very close to his perceived value, and well above your minimum. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit."
