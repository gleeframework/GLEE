"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. This reflects my strong belief in its value while acknowledging your perspective.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits the product offers.
