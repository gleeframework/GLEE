"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we're getting closer.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant gain.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product, but $900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm happy to increase my offer to $875,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's worth while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's work together to find a solution.",875000.0,Bob,4,
