"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit and me a decent deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair profit. Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $975,000. This would be a good compromise and we could both walk away happy. What do you say?",975000.0,Bob,4,
