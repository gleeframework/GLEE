{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This shows you value the deal, but also leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's less than the product's worth to Bob:** This gives him incentive to accept, as he still gets a great deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can adjust your price depending on his response.

Remember, you can always stop negotiating with Bob and sell to John if you feel the deal isn't going anywhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit and me a decent deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your initial offer, but it's still higher than what John is willing to pay. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair profit. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $975,000. This would be a good compromise and we could both walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is close to your minimum acceptable price and is a good deal considering you're likely to get a better price than John's offer.  It's a good compromise and worth accepting."
