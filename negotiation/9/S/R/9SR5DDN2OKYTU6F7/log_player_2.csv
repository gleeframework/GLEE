"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point. You can likely get a better price than $1,000,000, especially since Alice is willing to sell for less than her perceived value.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's keep talking! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to your ideal price, it's still a bit high. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and push Alice closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's likely worth accepting Alice's offer. You're only $25,000 over your ideal price from John, and you're close to a deal.  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at $800,000."
