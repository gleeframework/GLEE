``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully gets Bob interested.  I'll keep in mind that John is willing to pay $8,000, so I won't go below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While I'm happy with $8,000, I can try to get a little more from Bob.  I'll reject his offer and counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,000. This is still a good price for me, and hopefully it's enough to convince Bob to come closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Bob has come up to $8,500, which is closer to my desired price than John's offer.  I'll accept this offer."
