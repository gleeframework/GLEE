"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth at least $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's try to find a middle ground here! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 still doesn't quite work for me.  How about $10,500? That's a good compromise, and it allows us both to get a fair deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000. It's better to secure the known price from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
