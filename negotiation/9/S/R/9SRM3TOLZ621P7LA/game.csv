"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth at least $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's try to find a middle ground here!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  It's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 still doesn't quite work for me.  How about $10,500? That's a good compromise, and it allows us both to get a fair deal.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
