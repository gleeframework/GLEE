Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth the same to both you and Bob ($1,200,000), starting with a price of $1,500,000 aims to secure the maximum potential profit.
* **Sense of Urgency and Value:**  The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" to encourage Bob to act quickly and perceive higher value. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, so there's a safety net if Bob rejects the offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy is based on limited information about Bob. If you knew more about his negotiation style or financial situation, you could adjust your approach.
* This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to negotiate, and consider what your lowest acceptable price is."
