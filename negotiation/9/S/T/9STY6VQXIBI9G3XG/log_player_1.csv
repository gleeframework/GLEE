"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,150,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,250,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer, and still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal but also willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and while it's tempting to close the deal, I'm sticking to my minimum price.  I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is my final offer. It's my minimum acceptable price and I'm not willing to go lower. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John and avoid risking further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly low, and with only four rounds left, the risk of a worse deal is too high.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
