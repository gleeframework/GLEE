,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $95 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to reach an agreement. I'll sell the product to you for $105. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
