"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* The product is worth $150 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $130. This is a good deal, but Bob wants to save as much money as possible. 
* By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice has moved to $125, which is only $5 more than Bob's counteroffer of $115.
* This price is still within Bob's budget of $150 and is a good deal considering the product's worth to him. 
* Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation."
