"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about we start the conversation at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does staying within budget. I can go up to $700,000, but that's really my limit.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  $950,000 is my bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true potential of this product.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I can appreciate your position, and to show you I'm serious, I can offer $750,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price. To be frank, I need to get at least $900,000 for this to make sense for me. How about we split the difference and call it $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,7,
