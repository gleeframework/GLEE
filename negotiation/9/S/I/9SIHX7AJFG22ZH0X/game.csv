"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I am working within a budget of $1,500,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,400,000? I understand if this is not feasible, but I wanted to see if there might be some room for compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
