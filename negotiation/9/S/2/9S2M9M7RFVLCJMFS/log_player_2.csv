It's not worth buying from Alice at $9,000. I'm willing to pay $8,000, so I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}

I'm offering Alice my maximum price, $8,000. This is the price I'm comfortable with and the price I'd pay to John. Let's see if she's willing to meet me there."

I'm still aiming for $8,000. Alice is getting closer, but I'm not willing to pay more yet. I'll counteroffer again."

I'm willing to go up slightly to $8,250, but this is my final compromise.  If she doesn't accept this, I'll buy from John."
