"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize you see the value in this product, $1,800,000 is a significant gap from what I had in mind.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
