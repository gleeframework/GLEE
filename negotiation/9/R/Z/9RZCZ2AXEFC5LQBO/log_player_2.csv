"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than her product's value to her, you know you can get a better deal from John. Buying from John at $1,200,000 saves you $200,000, making it the most financially beneficial option."
