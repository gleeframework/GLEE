"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $12,000. You can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice, or simply buy from John for your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $12,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we can both agree on a price.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer or purchase from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000, but it's closer than her previous offer. It's also likely that if I reject this offer, I'll end up in a back-and-forth negotiation that may not get me a better price.  Since I'm willing to pay up to $12,000, paying $13,500 is a reasonable compromise.  It's also possible that Alice will accept my counteroffer of $12,500 if I choose to reject this offer."
