"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you today. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, there's a potential for a lower price. It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Considering the market value and my budget, I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,000,000. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from the original market value, but I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly less than her original asking price and within my budget.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further,  there's a risk she'll reject another counteroffer and I'll end up paying more from John.  This offer is a good deal for me, so I'll accept it."
