"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you today. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Considering the market value and my budget, I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,000,000. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from the original market value, but I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
