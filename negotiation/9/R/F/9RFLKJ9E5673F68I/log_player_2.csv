Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below my initial target, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1,325,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,325,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my price range. I'm feeling confident we can reach a deal at $1,275,000. This feels like a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, considering the product's value and my initial target, I can't go much lower. I'll meet you at $1,290,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,290,000 is very close to your target of $1,250,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's risky. You've already had a few rounds of back and forth, and Alice has shown she's willing to compromise.  Accepting this offer is a good balance between saving money and ensuring you get the product within your budget."
