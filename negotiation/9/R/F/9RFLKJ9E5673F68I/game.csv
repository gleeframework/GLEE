"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the generous starting point.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to buy it for $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below my initial target, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1,325,000.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,325,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my price range. I'm feeling confident we can reach a deal at $1,275,000. This feels like a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, considering the product's value and my initial target, I can't go much lower. I'll meet you at $1,290,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
