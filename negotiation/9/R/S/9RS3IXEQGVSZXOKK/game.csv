,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $85? I think this is a fair compromise, and it still allows me to get a decent price for the product.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $70 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $77?",77.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $77 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $81? That way we both get a fair deal, and I can still make a reasonable profit.",81.0,Alice,5,
