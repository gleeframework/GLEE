""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a unique item that I believe you'll find valuable. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $10,000.  We want to offer a price higher than this to make it seem like a good deal to him, while also maximizing our potential profit.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a higher price ($19,000) sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even though it's significantly higher than his valuation, it makes subsequent offers (if he negotiates) seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for potential negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and we can gradually decrease the price, potentially settling somewhere above our minimum ($15,000).
* **Backup Option:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John. This gives us leverage in the negotiation as we're not desperate to sell below that price."
