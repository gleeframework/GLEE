Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, but it's still above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This allows for room for negotiation while ensuring you get a good return on your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is a good amount, it's still below my desired price point. I'll try to get closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm confident that $900,000 is still a fair price considering the value Bob places on the product."
