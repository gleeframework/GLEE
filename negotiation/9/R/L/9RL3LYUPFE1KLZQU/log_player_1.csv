Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to discuss the price further if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, as that's her guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering it slightly below her fallback price ($11,999) leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not mentioning John, Alice subtly implies scarcity. Bob might be more inclined to accept a good offer if he thinks he could miss out.

**Important Note:** While Alice knows John will buy it for $12,000, she shouldn't reveal this information to Bob. Doing so would eliminate her negotiating advantage."
