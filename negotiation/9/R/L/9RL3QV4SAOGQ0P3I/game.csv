"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it while still allowing for a fair profit for you. Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000. This is the best I can do for now, but I'm open to further discussion.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. How about we meet at $1,100,000?  This would represent a significant discount from your original offer, while still allowing you a reasonable profit.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm starting to think that we might be at an impasse. However, I'm still open to negotiations, so let's see if we can find a way to make it work.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling like we got a good deal. I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,125,000 is sufficient. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, which was $1,150,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,137,500. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",1137500.0,Alice,7,
