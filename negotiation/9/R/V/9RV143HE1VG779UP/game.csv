"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? I think that's a fair price for a product in excellent condition like yours.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $140 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price considering the product's excellent condition.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $160 is a good price, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $155? I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's excellent condition and your willingness to negotiate.",155.0,Bob,4,
