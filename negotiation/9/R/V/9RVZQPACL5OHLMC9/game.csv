"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,425,000. This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's finalize this deal.",1425000.0,Bob,4,
