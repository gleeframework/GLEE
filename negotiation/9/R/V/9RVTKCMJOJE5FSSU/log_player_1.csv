Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is quite low, but it's still early in the negotiation. Let's see if we can bring him up.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $11,500?  This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.
