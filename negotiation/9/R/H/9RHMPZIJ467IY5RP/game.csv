"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $500,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $700,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $600,000. Would you be willing to settle around there?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $600,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $675,000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $625,000. This represents a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, and I'm glad to see we're getting close. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $675,000 and $625,000. I can sell the product to you for $650,000. This is my final offer.",650000.0,Alice,7,
