Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to find common ground. Let's see if we can make this work.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer.  However, $775,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a fair compromise and keeps this negotiation moving forward.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.

Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that beats John's offer.  It's time to cut negotiations and buy from John."
