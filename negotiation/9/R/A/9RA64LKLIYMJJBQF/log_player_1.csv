I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I'm confident I can get more than $100 for the product, and I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal."", ""product_price"": 125}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $110 is better than $100, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $125. I have a few more rounds to negotiate and don't want to settle too early."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $110 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $117.50.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $115. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. $115 is a good price, and I'm happy to close the transaction."
