"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given your needs. I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is within your budget, it's still a significant amount, and there's room for negotiation. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, signaling your serious intent to negotiate. The price is still within your budget, but it leaves room for Alice to counter while still allowing you to save a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but the value of this product is significant, and I can't go as low as $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer again. It's important to remember that your goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me. However, I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise, but you're still trying to get a better price. It's a small increase from your previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway. Hopefully, Alice will see this as a fair compromise and accept your offer."
