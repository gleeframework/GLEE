"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get it lower. Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer ($1,000,000) shows Alice that you are serious about negotiating and are willing to walk away. This hopefully encourages her to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly better than John's offer of $1,500,000.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice walking away and having to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  $1,100,000 is a good price, so accepting the offer minimizes risk and saves money compared to buying from John."
