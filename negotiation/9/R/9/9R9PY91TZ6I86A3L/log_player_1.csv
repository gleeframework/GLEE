Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value that would benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price point higher than $10,000 (my minimum acceptable price).
* **Highlight Value:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still ensuring a sale."
