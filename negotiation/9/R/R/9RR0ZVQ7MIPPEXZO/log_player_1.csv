"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. To kick off the negotiations, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $14,500, there's a good chance you'll eventually settle on a price that is beneficial for both parties while still exceeding your minimum. 
* **Appear Confident:**  A strong opening offer can signal that you believe in the value of your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's still early in the negotiation. There's a chance you could secure a better deal. You started high, signaling potential flexibility, so it's reasonable to see if Bob is willing to move closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit your business. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? "",
""product_price"": 13250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:** You've moved down from your initial offer, demonstrating that you're willing to negotiate. 
* **Aim for a Win-Win:** The $13,250 price point is a compromise that could potentially satisfy both parties. It's a significant increase from Bob's offer while still below your initial asking price.
* **Highlight Value:**  Reiterating the product's benefits reinforces its worth and justifies your counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is a reasonable compromise. It exceeds your minimum acceptable price, providing a profit, and shows Bob is willing to meet you closer to your desired range.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better offer, and prolonging the process has opportunity costs. Accepting now secures the deal. 
* **Avoid Risking the Sale:**  While you could hold out for a higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will agree, and you risk him walking away entirely.  Accepting a solid offer now mitigates that risk."
