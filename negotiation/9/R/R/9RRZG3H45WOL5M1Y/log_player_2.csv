"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while I gain a significant return.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to invest a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to recover a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still below Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, accepting the offer is the best move here.  This secures the product for a price that's still a good deal for Bob, and he avoids the risk of Alice further raising the price or completely rejecting further counteroffers."
