"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it could really benefit you. I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a lot higher than what the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob's initial counteroffer is $2,000 less than Alice's asking price. This is a significant reduction but still leaves room for potential negotiation. 
* **Fairness:**  The $12,000 offer is closer to the product's value for Alice, making it more likely she'll consider it. 
* **Strategic:**  This counteroffer signals Bob's seriousness in buying the product but also his willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $12,000. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above what Bob wants to pay, but it's closer to his desired price point.  However, Bob has a few rounds left to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a better deal.

* **Potential for Further Reduction:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, indicating there might be more room to lower the price.
* **Strategic Advantage:** Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob the power to make a counteroffer, potentially bringing the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,000. How about we settle at $12,500? That's a fair compromise, and it would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** Bob's counteroffer is the midpoint between his previous offer of $12,000 and Alice's current offer of $13,000. This signals a willingness to meet halfway and shows good faith in finding a mutually acceptable price.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $12,500 is still a decent saving for Bob compared to the original asking price and John's offer, while also leaving some room for Alice to make a small profit.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward, giving Bob more control and potentially leading to a better price in the long run."
