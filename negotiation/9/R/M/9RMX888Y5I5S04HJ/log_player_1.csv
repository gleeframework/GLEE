This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also allows for a good profit margin while remaining competitive. I'll be prepared to negotiate further if necessary."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I want to make a deal, I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise that benefits us both."
