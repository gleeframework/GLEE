"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $180 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementing his offers in very small amounts. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering.  It's more profitable to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
