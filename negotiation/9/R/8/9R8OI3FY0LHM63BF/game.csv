"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, but that's my absolute top limit. Let me know if you're interested in that price.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to the value I have in mind.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price, and it gives you a good return on your investment. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look elsewhere.",8500.0,Bob,4,
