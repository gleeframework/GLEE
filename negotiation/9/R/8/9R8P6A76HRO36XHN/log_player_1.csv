Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $1,080,000 is a strong outcome. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** This price still provides a healthy $80,000 profit over my minimum.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations risks stalling the deal. Accepting now guarantees the sale and avoids losing time I could spend on other opportunities. 
* **Bob's Determination:** Bob's consistent counteroffers demonstrate his interest. Accepting now capitalizes on his eagerness before he potentially lowers his offer or walks away."
