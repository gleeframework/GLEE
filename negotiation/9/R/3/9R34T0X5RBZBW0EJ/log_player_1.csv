Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is a great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate but also shows that I'm serious about a deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This leaves space for counteroffers and negotiations, allowing me to potentially earn a better price than my initial offer.
* **Keeping John as a backup:**  I'm still aware of John's offer and can always walk away if the negotiation with Bob doesn't reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I believe there's room for further negotiation.  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and hopefully reach a price that's closer to my desired range.
* **John remains a viable alternative:** Selling to John for $15,000 is still on the table if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints but making it clear that I won't accept such a low price.  $11,000 is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and his offer. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why $11,000 is fair.
* **Seeking common ground:** I'm expressing a willingness to continue negotiating and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While he's moved closer to my minimum, $10,500 is still below my acceptable threshold of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome:**  Bob has already indicated this is his final offer. Further negotiation might just prolong the process without significantly improving the price.
* **John provides a guaranteed higher price:** Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I meet my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

Given these factors, selling to John is the most beneficial choice for me at this point."
