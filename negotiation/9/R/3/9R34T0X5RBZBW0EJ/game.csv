,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
