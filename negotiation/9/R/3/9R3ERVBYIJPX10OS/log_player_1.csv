"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $800,000.  I'd like to start with a counteroffer of $600,000, a price that reflects a significant discount and leaves room for negotiation.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer and for countering. While I understand your perspective, the $600,000 offer significantly undervalues the true potential and worth of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this revised price better reflects the inherent value and the substantial returns you'll gain."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still a significant distance from what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a much more realistic price point for me.  This would be a considerable gain for you compared to selling to John, and it would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. While selling to John is always an option, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a price closer to $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but $750,000 is still too low.  How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000?  This reflects my effort to reach a deal while still acknowledging the product's true worth."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still significantly over my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This offer is a win-win â€“ you'd still be making a profit, and I'd be acquiring the product at a price I can comfortably afford. Let's reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has now hit his maximum budget and is unlikely to move significantly higher. Accepting $800,000 would be a substantial loss compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.  It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
