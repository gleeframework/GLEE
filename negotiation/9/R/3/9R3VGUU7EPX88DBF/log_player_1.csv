Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $950,000 is well above your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below the product's value to Bob:** $950,000 is still less than the $1,000,000 value to Bob, giving him an incentive to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still space for Bob to counteroffer without you needing to drop too low.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, and negotiation is key. By starting with a fair offer and leaving room for counteroffers, you can aim for a mutually agreeable price!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the value of the product to me, $850,000 would be a fair price.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you initially offered. There's still room for negotiation to get a better price. You're in a strong position because you have a backup offer from John. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, you can try to push for a price closer to your initial offer of $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to pay less, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still gives you a great deal, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is still above your minimum:** $900,000 is higher than your $800,000 minimum.
* **Is a compromise:** You're meeting Bob halfway, showing you're willing to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** There's still potential for further discussion, but you're getting closer to your desired price.

Remember, you have the backup offer from John, so you don't need to settle for a price that's too low."
