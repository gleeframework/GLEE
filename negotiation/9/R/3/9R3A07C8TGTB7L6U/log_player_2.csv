"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I believe it offers a great value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  He values the product at $120, so there's room to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can still get a better deal than $105.  He's willing to pay up to $120 and Alice is willing to sell for $80, so there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob a chance to get closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $102.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 102}
