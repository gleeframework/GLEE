"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8000 is my absolute minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9000? This would allow me to make the sale while still getting a fair price for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $7500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8500 is my final offer.  If you're serious about buying this product, let's see if we can reach an agreement.  ",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $8500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $7750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7750.0,Bob,6,
