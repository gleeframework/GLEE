"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't afford $11,500 at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would still be a great value for you, and it would help me get closer to my goal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Could we possibly meet at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to come down to $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make it happen!",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. I would like to counter with $10,500.",10500.0,Bob,6,
