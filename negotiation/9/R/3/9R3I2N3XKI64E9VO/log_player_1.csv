Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't afford $11,500 at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $12,000. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to sell to John.  We're running out of time, and while I'm close to my target with Bob, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price below my minimum.  John is a sure thing, and I can get my desired price with him."
