"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. It's still a great value for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $9000. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on that.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $10500. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10500 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get the product for $10000. That would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground there.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the product for $10000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $10200. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,7,
