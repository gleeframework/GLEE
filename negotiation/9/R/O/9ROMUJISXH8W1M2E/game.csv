"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product but I can only go as high as $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value it offers. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This way, we can both benefit from the deal. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This price is more than fair given my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Bob,4,
