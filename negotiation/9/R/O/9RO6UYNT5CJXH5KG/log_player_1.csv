Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always best to start with an offer higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a price above your baseline. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $150 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, and for you to potentially meet in the middle.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately rejects a price significantly above his perceived value, you can adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $75 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($100) and his own perceived value ($100). This indicates there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to the product's actual worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $75 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference (Almost):**  Bob offered $75, and your starting point was $150.  Meeting directly in the middle would be $112.50. By countering at $120, you're showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Maintain Value Perception:** You don't want to drop your price too drastically, or you risk devaluing the product in Bob's eyes. 
* **Keep John as Backup:** Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $100 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is still a bit much for my budget.  Could we settle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you know he values the product at ($100). There's room for one more counter-offer to try and bridge the gap.  You're getting close to the point where selling to John might be the better option, but it's worth one more attempt with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's make this work - how about $100? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** You're at a point where you need to maximize your profit and avoid further negotiation.  
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $100. By offering it at his perceived value, you're making it very difficult for him to refuse while still ensuring you get a fair price.
* **John as Backup:** If Bob rejects this offer, it's time to walk away and take John's guaranteed $100. There's no point going lower than Bob's own valuation."
