"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it for you too. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum of $10,000, it's still significantly below my desired price. I believe I can get closer to my goal with further negotiation. I want to see if I can push him higher before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,150? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 9150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,900 is closer to my desired price, it's still too low. I'm not ready to sell for that amount yet. I believe with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can push Bob closer to my desired price. Selling to John for $10,000 would be the easiest option, but I want to see if I can squeeze more value out of this deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,025? This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for you. Let's see if we can finally strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 9025}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,750 is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than his initial offer.  I've tried to negotiate, but it seems we're too far apart.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John for $10,000. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed sale."
