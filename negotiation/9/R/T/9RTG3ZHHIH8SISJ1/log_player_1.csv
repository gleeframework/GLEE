Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000 to you.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I have 9 rounds left to work with Bob, so I'm not going to settle for the minimum right away."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's latest offer is below my minimum, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  While I'd like to get a bit more, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. John is a reliable buyer, and I'm happy to secure a sale at $1,200,000."
