,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This product is a worthwhile investment and I'm confident you won't regret it.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $14,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
