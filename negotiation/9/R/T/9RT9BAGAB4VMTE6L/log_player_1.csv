This offer represents a significant profit for me while still leaving room for negotiation.  It's also a price that is likely to be attractive to Bob, as it is below his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price is fair considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is significantly higher than what John is willing to pay, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects a good compromise for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
