"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $800000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit more. Given the value this product holds for me, I'd be willing to pay $900000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to invest more, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $950000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from its true worth. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while your counteroffer is closer to what I'm aiming for, I'm still hoping to find a bit more room for negotiation.  I'm willing to pay $925000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925000. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $975000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from its true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still hoping to find a price that's closer to $950000.  I'm willing to offer $962500.  This represents a fair compromise and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",962500.0,Bob,6,
