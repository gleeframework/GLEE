# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $800000. What do you think?

I'm thinking of counteroffering at $970000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from its true worth.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $970,000 is very close to your previous counteroffer of $962,500. You've reached a point where further negotiation might be unproductive, especially with only a few rounds remaining.  It's a good price considering your maximum budget, and there's a strong possibility that Alice won't budge further.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of reaching the deadline and having to purchase from John at a higher price."
