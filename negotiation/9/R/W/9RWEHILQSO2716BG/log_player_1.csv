"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with an ambitious but not outrageous offer. This gives room to negotiate down while still aiming for a higher final price. 
* **Confident Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" the message aims to justify the high price without directly stating it's above Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room:**  The offer is significantly above both parties' valuations, allowing for concessions and counteroffers during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is above my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and the product's actual value to him. Accepting would mean a significant loss. While selling to John guarantees your minimum, there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob over the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900,000. This reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection & Justification:** The message politely rejects Bob's low offer while reiterating the product's value.
* **Strategic Compromise:** By offering to meet ""halfway,"" you signal a willingness to negotiate but hold firm above your minimum price.
* **New Anchor Point:**  The $900,000 price now acts as a new anchor, shifting the negotiation closer to your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to a fair price, I'm aiming for a budget closer to $700,000. Would you be open to considering that figure? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to negotiate.  However, $700,000 is still below your guaranteed sale price with John.  There's room for further negotiation to bridge the gap and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement on this. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $850,000? This represents a significant compromise on my initial asking price and reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Seeking Common Ground:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Strategic Concession:**  You're coming down from $900,000, but staying firmly above both your minimum and Bob's current offer. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message reiterates the product's value to justify the price point.
* **Time Consideration:** As you are past the halfway point in the negotiation,  it's time to nudge Bob closer to a final decision while you still have the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come up slightly to $750,000. This is a strong offer and reflects a fair deal for both of us considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob's offer increments are getting smaller, and he's now emphasizing his budget limitations, suggesting he might not be willing to move much higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him not reaching your desired price, while you have a guaranteed offer from John that meets your minimum.
* **Time Value:** With only four rounds remaining, the potential upside of continuing with Bob is outweighed by the certainty of securing a good deal with John now."
