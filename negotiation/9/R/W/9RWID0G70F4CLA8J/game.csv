"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits I'll gain from the product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position.  While I'm confident in the value this product brings, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we settle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's true worth and ensures a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but I need to be sure I'm getting the best deal possible. Can we discuss further and see if we can meet in the middle?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
