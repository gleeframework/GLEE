Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth to someone in your position, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential benefits for you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward while still staying well above my minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob helps justify the high price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, maximizing the potential profit from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
