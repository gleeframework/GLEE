"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that work for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,000 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $11,500?  It's a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. How about we settle at $11,200?  That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree.",11200.0,Bob,6,
