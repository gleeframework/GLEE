"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $9,500?  That feels like a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This is my final concession for now. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",10250.0,Alice,5,
