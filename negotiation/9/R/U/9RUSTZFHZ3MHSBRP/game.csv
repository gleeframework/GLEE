"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1050000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $1075000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1075000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you a price of $1062500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1062500.0,Alice,5,
