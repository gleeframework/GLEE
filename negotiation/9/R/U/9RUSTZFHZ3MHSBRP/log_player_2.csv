"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer is $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1050000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $1075000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is closer to his target, it's still higher than his maximum budget. He has 7 more rounds to negotiate, and it's worth trying to get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,075,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1075000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you a price of $1062500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,062,500 is still above Bob's target but getting closer. He has 5 more rounds to negotiate, but the risk of Alice walking away or needing to buy from John for $1,000,000 is high. Accepting this offer saves Bob $62,500 compared to buying from John. It's a reasonable compromise, especially considering the limited negotiation time remaining."
