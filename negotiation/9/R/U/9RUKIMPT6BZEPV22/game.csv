"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I can offer you a compromise: $18000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we perhaps settle on $16000 for the product?",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $16000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $17500? This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'll make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle at $17250? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",17250.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to give up more than $500 from my last offer. How about we meet at $17250 again? I'm not budging from this price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",17250.0,Alice,9,
