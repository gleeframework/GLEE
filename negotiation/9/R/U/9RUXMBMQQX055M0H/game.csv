"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant value it holds.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but the offer of $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the product's potential. How about we consider $1,900,000? This feels like a fairer starting point for further discussion.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but so does my budget. $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000?  This is a serious offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
