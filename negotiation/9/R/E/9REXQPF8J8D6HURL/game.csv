"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $975,000. I can offer you a slightly better deal - $1,025,000. This is still a great price for the product, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I can sell the product to you for $1,012,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1012500.0,Alice,7,
