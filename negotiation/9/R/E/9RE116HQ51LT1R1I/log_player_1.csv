Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly lower than that. Let's say I'll offer it to him for:

{""product_price"": $750,000}

This is a good starting point, as it's still a significant amount of money, but leaves some room for negotiation. Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still a decent amount of money. Since I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, I'll think carefully about my next move.

I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $725,000 and send him a counteroffer that's higher than his offer, but still lower than my initial offer. Let's say I'll offer it to him for:

{""product_price"": $750,000}

This should give us a good chance to find a mutually beneficial price. If Bob rejects this offer, I can always consider selling the product to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send my counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": $750,000}

This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's slightly higher than his offer, but still a bit lower than my initial offer. Let's see what Bob thinks of it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial offer, but I'm still not convinced that it's the best deal for me. Since I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, I'll think carefully about my next move.

I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $720,000 and send him a new counteroffer that's closer to my initial offer. Let's say I'll offer it to him for:

{""product_price"": $765,000}

This should give us a good chance to find a mutually beneficial price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling the product to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send my counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": $765,000}

This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's previous offers. It's slightly higher than his last offer, and I'm hoping it will be more appealing to him. Let's see what Bob thinks of it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $740,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial offer, but I'm still not convinced that it's the best deal for me. Since I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, I'll think carefully about my next move.

I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $740,000 and consider selling the product to John for $800,000. I've already had a few rounds of negotiation with Bob, and I'm not sure we'll be able to find a mutually beneficial price. John is willing to pay me the full value of the product, so I think it's time to consider selling to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I apologize, I made a mistake! I previously decided to sell the product to John for $800,000, but since I was given the option to send another counteroffer to Bob, I'll do so. However, I'll make a very slight adjustment to my previous offer to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle.

I'll send my counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": $760,000}

This is a very slight increase from my previous offer, and I'm hoping it will be enough to get Bob to meet me in the middle. If not, I'll stick with my original decision to sell the product to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","I've reached the final decision point!

Since Bob's offer of $750,000 is still lower than my initial offer, and I've already had a few rounds of negotiation with him, I think it's time to stick with my original plan.

I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell the product to John for $800,000, as I know that's the minimum value I can get for it. Bob's offers have been getting closer, but I'm not willing to compromise further."
