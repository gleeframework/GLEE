"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I believe the product has value, the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 undervalues the true worth of this product. It offers significant potential for you, valued at $1,000,000, as you know. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but the price is still a bit high for me. I can offer $760,000 to be fair.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $760,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I need to be mindful of the product's true value. How about we settle at $825,000? This reflects a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm seeing your efforts to find a middle ground here. How about we do this - I'll offer $790,000, and I think that's a very fair deal. It reflects my strong interest in the product while recognizing it's not something I'd pay full price for.",790000.0,Bob,6,
