"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I am proposing a price of $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. $12,000 is still too high for him, so he should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I propose a price of $10,500. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. $10,500 is still above his limit, and he has more rounds to negotiate. He should reject the offer and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value we both place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, Bob. To further facilitate this transaction, I propose a final price of $10,000 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our respective valuations while ensuring a profitable outcome for me. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price, but Alice seems unwilling to budge much. At this point, Bob has two options:

1. **Accept Alice's offer:** This would cost him $10,000, which is still higher than his preferred price of $8,000. 
2. **Buy from John:** This is the safest option for Bob, as he can buy the product for his maximum budget of $8,000. 

Given that Bob wants to save as much money as possible and is already approaching his limit, buying from John is the most logical choice."
