Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective, $900,000 simply isn't a price I can accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I still need to ensure I get a fair value for what I'm offering.  How about $1,050,000?
