"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($120) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product for my minimum acceptable value, $120. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm still hoping to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value, but it's getting closer. Given that we're already on round 4, I'm accepting his offer, as I risk losing out on both Bob and John if I keep going.  $115 is better than nothing, and I still have 6 rounds left to potentially negotiate with John."
