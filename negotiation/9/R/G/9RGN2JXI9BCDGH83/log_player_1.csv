**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently unwilling to move substantially from his $800,000 comfort zone. While his counteroffers are increasing, the increments are small. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a price significantly closer to your $1,000,000 valuation. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, representing a clean and more profitable conclusion to the sale."
