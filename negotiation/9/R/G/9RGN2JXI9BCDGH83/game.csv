"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe you'd benefit greatly from this product.  My final offer is $875,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I hope it reflects the value you'll gain.",875000.0,Alice,5,
