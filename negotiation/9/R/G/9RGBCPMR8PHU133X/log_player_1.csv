Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Considering its value and quality, I believe it's worth $120 to you. Would you like to proceed with this offer?"", ""product_price"": 120}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to accept $105 for it?  I think that's a fair price considering its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
