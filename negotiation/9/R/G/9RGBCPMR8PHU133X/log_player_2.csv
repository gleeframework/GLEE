"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Considering its value and quality, I believe it's worth $120 to you. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While $120 is his maximum price, Alice's initial offer is at his limit.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to accept $105 for it?  I think that's a fair price considering its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To move forward, I would propose a price of $115 for the product. This offers a compromise between our initial offers and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's already saved $5 from his initial budget, and while he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject and he'll be forced to buy from John at his maximum price.  It's a good compromise and a solid deal for Bob."
