"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I make it clear I'm willing to negotiate, which could lead to a faster agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Profit:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I can still make more by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  By rejecting, I can see if Bob is truly serious about buying the product or just trying to lowball me. 
* **Negotiation is a Game:** It's important to show that I'm not afraid to walk away, which can incentivize Bob to come up with a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $95? That would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm but Flexible:**  I'm not accepting his offer but I'm also not being unreasonable.  
* **Split the Difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can show willingness to compromise.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him. 
* **Open Communication:**  I'm encouraging open communication and a mutually beneficial agreement."
