"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $15,000.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  I think this would be a fair deal for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it at $15,000.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,100. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11100.0,Alice,7,
