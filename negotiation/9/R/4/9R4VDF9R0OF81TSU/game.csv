"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. While I do see the value in your product, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be happy to purchase it for $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $105 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to pay $90 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can do $98 for the product, which is still a great value for you and a fair price for me. Let me know what you think.",98.0,Alice,5,
