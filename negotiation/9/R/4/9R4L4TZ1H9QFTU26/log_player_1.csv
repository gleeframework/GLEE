"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm starting with an offer of $1,200,000. This reflects the product's unique value and potential. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** My message emphasizes the product's value to justify the high starting price.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I emphasize finding a price that benefits both of us. This builds goodwill and increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** While I appreciate his counteroffer and willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **I have more leverage.** I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to negotiate a higher price in subsequent rounds.

**Next steps:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my target of $1,000,000 in the next round. I'll aim to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product.  Considering its unique features and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is still well within a reasonable range and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a lower price but still above my minimum:**  I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility but still remaining above my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Reiterate product value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Focus on a mutually beneficial agreement:**  I continue to emphasize finding a price that benefits both of us to encourage cooperation and a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the market. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While he's getting closer, $950,000 is still less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **I have a safety net.**  I can sell to John for $1,000,000, so I don't need to settle for a lower price out of desperation.
* **Opportunity to push for a better deal.**  By rejecting his offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my target price.

**Next steps:**

* I will make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the unique features and potential of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'm offering $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's true value.  I hope you'll agree to this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with my minimum price:** I'm offering my absolute minimum price to show that I'm serious about reaching an agreement. 
* **Highlighting value and fairness:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that my offer is fair.
* **Expressing hope for agreement:** I'm expressing hope that Bob will accept my offer to encourage a positive outcome.

**Reasoning:**

* Bob has consistently offered below my minimum.
* My minimum price is still beneficial to Bob, as it's less than the product's value to him. 
* I have the option to sell to John for the same price, so I'm not taking a loss.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my offer, the deal is closed.
* If he rejects it, I'll need to carefully consider my options, as we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway again, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $975000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the market. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While he's getting closer, $975,000 is still less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.**  There are only four rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John for my minimum price.
* **The risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential gain.**  There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further, and continuing to negotiate could result in a lower price or even a failed deal.

**Reasoning:**

* Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* This decision is based on the limited remaining rounds and the potential for a failed deal.
* My target price has always been $1,000,000, and John is willing to pay that, so it's a secure and profitable outcome."
