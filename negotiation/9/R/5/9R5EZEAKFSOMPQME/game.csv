"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $725,000, but I'll throw in some additional features and support that will make it worth the extra $25,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",725000.0,Alice,5,
