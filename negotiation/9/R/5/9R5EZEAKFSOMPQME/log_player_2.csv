"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do $650,000?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer  tests Alice's willingness to negotiate. While it's a big jump down, it leaves me room to increase my offer if needed while staying well below my $800,000 maximum."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $725,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is willing to negotiate, but $725,000 is still a significant amount above my initial target. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to $700,000."

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm holding firm at $700,000. This price point represents a significant saving for me while still being a reasonable offer for Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $725,000, but I'll throw in some additional features and support that will make it worth the extra $25,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
