"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $760,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $760,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $815,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great value for you.",815000.0,Alice,5,
