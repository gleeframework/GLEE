Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're still interested in the product. I can see you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $82.50, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down below $80.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John for $80 than risk getting a worse price from Alice in the remaining rounds."
