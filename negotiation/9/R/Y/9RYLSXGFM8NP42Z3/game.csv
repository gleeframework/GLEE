,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's fair given the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still unable to agree to $9,500. I would like to counteroffer at $8,500 for the product.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  However, I can't go any lower than $9,000.  This is a final offer from me. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll need to explore other options.  Think carefully, this is a valuable product and this price reflects that.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. We're running out of time here, and I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to go down to $8,900. This is a significant compromise, and I don't think I can go any lower.  Let's make a deal now before I have to move on to other options.",8900.0,Alice,7,
