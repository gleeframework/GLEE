"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $9,500. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired price range. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's a chance he might be able to get it for closer to his $8,000 valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $8,500? I'm genuinely interested in this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $9,000 is still within Bob's budget of $10,000.  While he could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice will not budge from her final offer. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price he's comfortable with, saving him $1,000 compared to buying from John."
