Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point because it's a reasonable price for both of us. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a higher price.  

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer.  I'm prepared to walk away from the deal if I believe I won't be able to get a price that's good enough for me, but I will also consider John's offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum value of $120. I'm not willing to sell the product at a loss, especially since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $120. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value. I'll keep in mind John's offer as a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't prove fruitful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It's still a good price for me, as it's above Bob's offer, but also lower than my minimum value. 

This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price. However, I'm still keeping John's offer in mind and will proceed with caution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $95.  While it's getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below my preferred price point.  I'm not willing to sell for a significant loss, particularly since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $120. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price that's more in line with my minimum value, but I'll also consider how much leverage I have given John's offer and my assessment of how likely Bob is to accept a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $105. This is a slight increase from my previous offer and shows my willingness to compromise.  It's also still higher than Bob's latest offer, but below my minimum value. 

This counteroffer is a strategic move to potentially push Bob closer to my desired price point. However, I am still keeping John's offer in mind and will be prepared to accept a lower price if necessary or walk away entirely if the negotiation doesn't seem fruitful."
