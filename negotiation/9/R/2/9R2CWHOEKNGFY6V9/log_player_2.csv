{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $11,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to his target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I value this product, $11,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price that allows for a profit for you while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, which is a good compromise. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still $750 over his target of $10,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price. There's also the possibility that Alice will come down further if she sees Bob is serious about getting a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,750 is tempting, it's still a bit above what I can comfortably pay right now.  I'm prepared to pay $10,250.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it will allow us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500 again, but I'll throw in a small concession. I'll include a free upgrade that's worth $500. So, the total price would be $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally reached Bob's target price of $10,000.  Even though it's not a significant discount from Alice's original offer, it's still a good deal for Bob.  The added free upgrade also sweetens the deal, making it worth Bob's while to accept the offer.  It's also important to note that Bob is running out of time, and if he rejects the offer, he might be forced to buy the product from John for the same price but without the extra benefit."
