"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $150. You can do better by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John, who is willing to sell for your maximum budget."
