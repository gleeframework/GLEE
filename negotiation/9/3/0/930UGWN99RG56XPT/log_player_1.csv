"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good strategy to start with a price higher than your desired selling price. This gives you room to negotiate and appear flexible.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is in the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind, you have John as a backup buyer at $10,000, so you're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is already above your minimum acceptable price ($10,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a significant gap between Bob's offer and your initial asking price, suggesting there's room for further negotiation.
* **Early Stage:** It's only round 2, and walking away now might leave money on the table. 

**Next Step:** We will send Bob a counteroffer in Round 3, aiming to close the gap and secure a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $15,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  By coming down from your initial price, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Concession:** A $1,500 reduction is a significant concession, but it keeps the price well above your minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** Framing the reduction as ""meeting halfway"" makes it seem like a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,500. I'd be willing to pay $12,500, which I think is a more reasonable price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $12,500 is a solid profit above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating genuine interest. However, his increments are getting smaller, suggesting he's nearing his limit.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation further might not yield a significantly better offer from Bob. Accepting now secures a good deal without risking losing the sale entirely."
