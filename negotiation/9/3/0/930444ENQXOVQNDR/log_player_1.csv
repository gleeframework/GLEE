Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a little more than his minimum, but I'm also ready to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, so I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm countering with $130. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's a compromise. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. It's not worth the risk of further negotiations. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates any further potential losses."
