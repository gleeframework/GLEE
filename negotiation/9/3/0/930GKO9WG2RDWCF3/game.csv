"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to keep some profit while still giving you a great deal on this product.  What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $97.50, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal, what do you say?",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit short on budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we go with $96? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",96.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $96, but I'm hoping we can close the deal at $97.  This would be a good middle ground for both of us.  It's a fair price, and we can finalize the sale.",97.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $97. I'm willing to meet you at $95, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might need to explore other options if we can't come to an agreement.",95.0,Bob,8,
