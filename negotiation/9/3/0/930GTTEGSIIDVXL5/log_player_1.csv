Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, but still keeps the value of the product above my minimum of $8,000.  I'll see what Bob's response is before deciding whether to adjust the price or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still above my minimum of $8,000.  I'll take the deal, rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with less."
