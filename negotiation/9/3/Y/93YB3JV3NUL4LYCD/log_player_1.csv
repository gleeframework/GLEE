"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've expressed interest in. I'm starting with a price of $110.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss it further."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's important to start with a price above what you think Bob is willing to pay. This gives you room to negotiate and allows you to potentially earn the maximum amount. 
* **Be Friendly:**  A positive message sets the tone for a good negotiation. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $110 is higher than Bob's value, it is still lower than your minimum of $100, giving him incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I would like to propose a lower price of $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $95 is below my minimum of $100, so accepting it would be a loss. 
* **Room for counter-offer:**  I can still negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a price that is closer to my minimum.  
* **John's offer is secure:**  If I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob, I can always sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest.  While $95 is a good price, it's a bit lower than I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a middle ground:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum, showing I'm open to negotiation but not desperate.
* **Maintain positive tone:**  Staying friendly encourages further discussion. 
* **Highlight the value:** ""Let's see if we can find a middle ground"" suggests a potential for a win-win agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  $100 is my minimum acceptable price, so accepting his offer is a good outcome. 
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  While I could try to get a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee I'll succeed.  
* **John's offer is a backup:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I can still sell to John for the same price."
