"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, as I believe this price is fair and reflects its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but my budget simply doesn't allow me to go above $1,100,000. This price represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement. Let me know if you're open to this final offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your commitment to acquiring the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
