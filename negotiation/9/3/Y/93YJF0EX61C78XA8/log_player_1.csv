Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $140, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While I'm aiming for as much money as possible, I'm also leaving some room for negotiation to keep Bob engaged. If he rejects this offer, I can then lower the price slightly.
* **John as Backup:**  I have a backup buyer in John, who will pay $150, which gives me a strong position to walk away from the negotiation if Bob's offers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $120. Would you be willing to consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even below my initial offer of $140. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still potential for Bob to come up in price, so rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John as backup:** I can always sell to John for $150 if the negotiation fails, so there's no urgency to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $130 is a compromise between my initial offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $120. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to give in too much. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob that $130 is still a good deal for him, considering his perceived value of $80.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, which protects my interests and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $120 was a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, $125 is still significantly lower than my desired price.  
* **John's offer is better:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $150.  There's no need to continue haggling with Bob when I have a better offer already in hand. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob could lead to further price reductions and a potential loss of profit. Selling to John ensures a safe and profitable outcome."
