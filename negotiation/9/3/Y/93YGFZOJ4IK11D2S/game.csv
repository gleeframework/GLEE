"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective. However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and $950,000 is a fair reflection of that.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This offer still ensures a beneficial deal for both of us. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $900,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
