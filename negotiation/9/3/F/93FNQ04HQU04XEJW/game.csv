"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8900. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider.",8900.0,Alice,5,
