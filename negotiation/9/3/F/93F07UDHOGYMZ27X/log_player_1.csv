"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum acceptable value of $8,000.  I want to see if Bob is interested in paying a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I want to see if there's any room for negotiation. There are still 8 rounds left. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a higher price. There are still 6 rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's only slightly above my minimum. I will counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $8,800. I'm getting closer to his price point, but I'm still holding firm on getting something more than my absolute minimum."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but I still believe I can get a slightly higher price. There are still 4 rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I will counter his offer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $8,800, which is above my minimum acceptable value of $8,000. With only two rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid potentially losing the deal altogether."
