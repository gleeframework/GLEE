{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still trying to push for a high price, despite multiple rejections.  I'm not yet willing to accept a price this close to her original offer.  I'll continue to negotiate, but if she doesn't budge, I may need to consider buying from John.  There are still a few rounds left."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers have been stubbornly high.  This counteroffer is a small increase from my previous one, showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a lower price.  I need to start moving the price closer to her value to see if we can reach a deal before I need to consider John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are getting closer to my maximum, but it's still a very expensive purchase.  I'm not yet ready to accept a price this high, and there are still rounds remaining. I'll continue to counteroffer, but I'm starting to consider the possibility of buying from John if we can't reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are approaching my maximum, and the negotiation is getting tense. This counteroffer is equal to her value for the product, which is likely the lowest she'll be willing to accept.  If she rejects this, I might have to consider buying from John.  It's a risky move, but it's my last chance to secure a lower price."
