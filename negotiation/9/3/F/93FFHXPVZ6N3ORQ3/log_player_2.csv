"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its immense value and potential impact on your endeavors, we believe it's worth more than just monetary exchange. However, for the sake of a transaction, let's discuss a fair price. I am offering the product to you for $11000, which is a significant discount considering its true worth of $12000 to you. This offer aims to ensure both parties benefit from this interaction. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations or if you need further information. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  $11,000
* **Your Maximum Value:** $12,000
* **John's Price:** $12,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John. While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee you'd get a better price, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
