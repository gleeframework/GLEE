"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it's valuable to both of us. My initial offer is $1100000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than the $1,200,000 John is asking, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and your interest, I am willing to sell it for $1075000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target:**  $1,075,000 is closer to Bob's desired price point than John's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that continuing negotiations will result in Alice getting closer to her minimum of $1,000,000, potentially leading to a worse price for Bob.
* **Time constraint:** With only 7 rounds remaining, it's crucial to secure a deal, especially given that John's price is the fallback option.

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a decent price within his budget and without risking losing the deal."
