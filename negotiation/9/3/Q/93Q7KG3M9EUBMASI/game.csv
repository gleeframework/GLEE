"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the price to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is my absolute minimum. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000. Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm confident the product is worth more than that to you. Let's meet in the middle at $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
