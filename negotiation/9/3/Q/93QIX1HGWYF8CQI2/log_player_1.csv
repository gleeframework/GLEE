Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $119."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, exceeding John's offer ($120). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** By offering a ""great deal,"" I aim to incentivize Bob to accept quickly without overthinking."
