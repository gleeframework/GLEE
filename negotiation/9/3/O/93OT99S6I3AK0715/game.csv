"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I understand the product's value, but I'm only willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is my maximum offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a substantial compromise, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,800,000 is still above my budget.  I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I can't go higher than $1,400,000. This offer represents a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the product's potential. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see that we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. I believe this represents a significant concession on my part and a fair price for a product of this caliber.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we are making progress, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, but I can't go any higher. This is a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
