"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,700,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,700,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
