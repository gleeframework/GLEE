"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject the offer.  You're trying to get the price down to $8,000, and Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This is a reasonable counteroffer. You are showing Alice that you are serious about buying the product, but you are also making it clear that you are not willing to pay her full asking price. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still ensuring you are within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice has increased her price from the first round. This is a sign that she is unwilling to negotiate further. However, you are still within your budget and have several rounds left. It is worthwhile to continue negotiating to see if you can reach a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

You're increasing your offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice you're serious about buying but still within your budget. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is clearly not willing to budge much. You've gone through several rounds and are still far from your target price of $8,000. It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John at $8,000 than risk further negotiation with Alice."
