"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is above your maximum budget of $80. You have room to negotiate a lower price. You should reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:** By starting with a counteroffer of $65, we aim to establish a lower price range right from the beginning. This gives us room to negotiate upwards if needed while still potentially securing a significant discount.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product. This helps maintain a positive tone for a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product for $75. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $75 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. You can try to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to $70. Remember, you always have the option to buy from John for $80 if the negotiations don't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $70? That would work well for me."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** By proposing $70, we're continuing to negotiate towards a price closer to our target.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":**  This framing makes the offer seem fair and potentially more appealing to Alice. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and reiterates our interest in the product at the right price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I'm willing to go down to $72, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $72, which is a reasonable price and within your $80 budget. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice won't budge, and you'll end up paying $80 at John's. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
