I am confident that this investment will not only meet but exceed your expectations. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any questions about the product. I am here to assist you every step of the way. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is significantly better than the $1,000,000 you would pay John. While the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, it's still a good deal to get it for $800,000 and save $200,000."
