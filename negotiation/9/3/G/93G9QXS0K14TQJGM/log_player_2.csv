"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $1,500,000 is above his budget, and he has a backup option with John for $1,000,000.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,200,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget.  He can still get the product from John for $1,000,000.  He should try to negotiate further with Alice to see if he can get closer to his target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and I'm glad to see we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and counteroffer at $1150000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

Bob should buy the product from John. While Alice has lowered her price significantly, it's still above Bob's preferred price. Since John offers the product for $1,000,000, it's the best option for Bob to save the most money."
