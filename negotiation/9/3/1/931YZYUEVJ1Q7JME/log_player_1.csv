Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly higher than that. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $130.

{""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $125. Since this is higher than my minimum price of $120, I'll consider accepting his offer. However, I'd like to get a bit more for the product, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer of my own.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to pay $125, I'll try to get a bit closer to my minimum price of $130. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $128.
