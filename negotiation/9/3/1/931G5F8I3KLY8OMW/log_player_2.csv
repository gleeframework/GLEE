"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than what John is selling for, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. By offering $13,000, he's splitting the difference between Alice's offer and his maximum budget, leaving room for potential compromise. This counteroffer is still within Alice's profit margin, making it a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and only $500 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  Continuing to negotiate might save Bob a little more, but the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and Bob having to buy from John for a higher price is too high.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal while minimizing risk."
