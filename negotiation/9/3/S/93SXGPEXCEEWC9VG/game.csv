"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it has the potential to generate significant returns for you. My initial offer is $950,000.

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me in the middle or consider a slightly lower price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $750,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to show my commitment to this deal, but $850,000 is the lowest I can go. This still leaves room for profit for you, and allows me to ensure I'm getting a fair value for the product.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, $850,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $800,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a smart financial decision. Can you consider this offer?",800000.0,Bob,4,
