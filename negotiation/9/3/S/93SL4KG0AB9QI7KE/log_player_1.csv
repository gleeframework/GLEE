"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its true value to me is much higher. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High starting price:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm confident in the value of the product.
* **Positive framing:** I'm focusing on the benefits for Bob, emphasizing the ""fantastic deal"" and highlighting the value discrepancy between my perceived value and the offered price. 
* **Openness to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, showing I'm willing to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

I want to maximize my profit, but I also need to consider the possibility of selling to John. By starting high, I create a space for negotiation while leaving myself an opportunity to walk away if Bob becomes unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point through further negotiation, and I still have plenty of rounds to do so.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting the offer shows Bob I'm serious about getting a better price and helps me maintain leverage in the negotiation.
* **Exploring potential for higher offer:**  I believe I can secure a higher price with more rounds of negotiation, especially since Bob is already showing interest. 
* **Avoiding the ""safe"" option:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm aiming for a better deal and want to see if I can reach that $1,200,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromising, but not too much:**  I'm raising the price from Bob's offer but am also dropping my price from the previous round. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I still value the product highly.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's desire for a good deal while also emphasizing the value proposition.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my desired outcome.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to pay and see if I can reach a price closer to my $1,200,000 goal without jeopardizing the deal. This offer is a strong compromise, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price,  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm confident I can secure a better deal with more rounds of negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting the offer shows Bob I'm serious about getting a better price and helps me maintain leverage in the negotiation.
* **Focusing on my minimum:** I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,000,000, and I still have several rounds to work with.
* **Avoiding premature sale:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I believe I can potentially get a higher price through continued negotiation with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet, but I'm still confident this product is worth more than $950,000 to you. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000, which is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it offers. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and push Bob towards a decision. 
* **Compromise with a clear reason:** I'm dropping my price slightly but am still emphasizing the value and benefits of the product, justifying my final offer.
* **Shifting the focus:**  By mentioning ""other options"" (without explicitly mentioning John), I'm subtly suggesting that I have alternatives, reminding Bob of the potential risk of losing the deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Increasing pressure:** By declaring this as my final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to accept. 
* **Close to the minimum:**  This offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not giving much more ground.
* **Preparing for the ""safe"" option:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to sell to John, as I've clearly indicated my willingness to consider other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is my final offer before I consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below the $1,000,000 I'm aiming for. With several rounds of negotiation left, I'm not ready to settle for a price below my minimum. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting the offer shows Bob that I'm not desperate for a deal and am willing to walk away if I don't get a satisfactory price.
* **Focusing on the minimum:** I'm still holding firm on my minimum price and aiming to get closer to my target of $1,200,000.
* **Weighing risks and rewards:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I'm still confident that I can get a better price with Bob, especially since he's stated that this is his final offer, creating a sense of urgency."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still committed to getting a fair price for my product.  $975,000 simply doesn't reflect its value, especially considering the benefits it offers you.

This is my final offer, and I'm prepared to consider other options if we can't reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
