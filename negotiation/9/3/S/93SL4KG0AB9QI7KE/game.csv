"I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet, but I'm still confident this product is worth more than $950,000 to you. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000, which is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it offers. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still committed to getting a fair price for my product.  $975,000 simply doesn't reflect its value, especially considering the benefits it offers you. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm prepared to consider other options if we can't reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
