,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This reflects the product's worth while recognizing your interest.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $17,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
