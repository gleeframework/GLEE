{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's within your budget, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($1,200,000). This means there's room for negotiation.
* **You have time:** You have 10 rounds, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a suboptimal offer.
* **Exploring options:** Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can get a better price.  

By rejecting, you initiate the negotiation process and have the opportunity to secure a better deal."

Round 2

* **Testing the waters:** This gives Alice a clear indication of your desired price range.
* **Room for compromise:**  There's still space for both of you to meet in the middle and come to an agreement. 

This counteroffer is designed to initiate a negotiation that could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome."

{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between Alice's previous offer and our initial counteroffer. 
* **Fair value:**  This price reflects the product's worth to Alice, making it a reasonable starting point for a potential deal. 
* **Limited time:** While we have 6 rounds left, we need to start closing the gap to avoid running out of time. 

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a price that benefits us."
