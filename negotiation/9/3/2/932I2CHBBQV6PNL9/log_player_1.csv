I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's below Bob's perceived value but allows for some room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will find this offer attractive, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $14,000, it's not worth risking a further negotiation and potentially losing the sale."
