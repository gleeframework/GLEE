"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering the product for $14,000. While this is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is willing to sell for $12,000, and you're willing to pay up to $15,000, a price of $13,000 represents a reasonable compromise. This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's original offer, giving you the potential for a substantial saving. It also leaves room for Alice to make a counteroffer if she's not happy with this price, but still allows you to potentially purchase the product at a lower price than John's offer."
