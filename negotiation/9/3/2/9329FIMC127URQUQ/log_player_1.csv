{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $125? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I'm hoping for.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $125. How about $115? That's my absolute maximum, and I'm willing to meet you halfway at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get closer to $125, Bob's offer of $115 is still a good deal for me. It's more than selling to John, and we're getting closer to a deal. I'll accept his offer and move on."
