"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. My initial offer is $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he knows he can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000? "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is starting with a significant discount to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Offer:** $1,000,000 is a substantial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is polite but firm, showing Bob's interest while setting a clear price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. My counteroffer is $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Bob is still trying to get the lowest possible price. 
* **Alice's Counter:**  Alice's counteroffer is a step in the right direction, but it's still above Bob's desired price.
* **Negotiation:**  There's room for further negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price if he continues to counter.

**Next Steps:**  Bob should counter with a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I can comfortably go right now.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,050,000? This would allow both of us to achieve a fair outcome."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by meeting Alice halfway between their previous offers.
* **Clear Price:**  The counteroffer is specific and avoids ambiguity.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a polite and collaborative tone to encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1050000. My counteroffer is $1080000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice is coming down in price, which is positive. However, Bob's goal is to save as much as possible.
* **Counteroffer Advantage:** Bob is still in a good position to negotiate further.  Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and Bob can potentially secure a lower price by continuing to counter.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is a fallback, it's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.

**Next Steps:**  Bob should counter with a price slightly higher than his previous offer, perhaps $1,060,000 or $1,070,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  Let's try to bridge that gap just a bit further. How about $1,070,000? This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1070000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** Bob is increasing his offer by a small amount, showing flexibility while still working towards his goal. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the fair price for both parties and expresses confidence in closing the deal.
* **Negotiation Momentum:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and puts pressure on Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I get a good price for the product. My counteroffer is $1080000, which is the same as my previous offer. I'm willing to hold firm at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is refusing to budge from her previous offer of $1,080,000. 
* **Time Constraint:**  The negotiation is nearing the end.  If Bob rejects this offer, he may not have time to reach a lower price. 
* **Better Price:** While it's not the ideal price, $1,080,000 is still a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,200,000.

**Decision:**  It's time to accept Alice's offer. Bob will save $120,000 compared to buying from John."
