"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to consider $1000000? ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. My counteroffer is $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1100000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I can comfortably go right now.  Let's split the difference - how about $1050000? This would allow both of us to achieve a fair outcome.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1050000. My counteroffer is $1080000, which is a compromise between our previous offers.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  Let's try to bridge that gap just a bit further. How about $1070000? This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",1070000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I get a good price for the product. My counteroffer is $1080000, which is the same as my previous offer. I'm willing to hold firm at this price.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
