"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while acknowledging its true market value.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
