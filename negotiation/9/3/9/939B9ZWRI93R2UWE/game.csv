"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I still think $7,500 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
