"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've done my research and believe it's worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is still too high for Bob.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your assessment of the product's value, I'm not quite ready to commit to that price.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $900,000, it's still higher than Bob's target price. Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $750,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly coming down in price, but $825,000 is still above Bob's target. With 5 rounds left, there's time to continue negotiating and try to get the price down closer to $750,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $825,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $775,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $775,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is now at the point where Bob is getting a good deal. It's only $25,000 above his target price.  It's a fair compromise and a good value for Bob, considering the potential for John's much higher price.  With 3 rounds left, there's not enough time to potentially squeeze out another significant price reduction.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal for Bob."
