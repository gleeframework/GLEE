Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}

This is a risky move, as it's very close to my minimum and we're running out of time. However, with only three rounds remaining, I need to push for a slightly higher price. If Bob rejects, I might have to accept his next offer or sell to John."
