I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob.  I will counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between our previous offers. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still securing a profitable sale for myself."

I will accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a slightly higher price,  $13,000 is still a good deal and significantly better than selling to John. Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to further delays and potentially lower prices. It's time to close the deal."
