{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000.  This price reflects the significant benefits you'll gain.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's still lower than my minimum acceptable value but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, suggesting he'll benefit significantly. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, acknowledging there's likely room for discussion.

**Strategy:**

* This offer creates a starting point for negotiation. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potential negotiation range.
* If Bob counteroffers, I'll assess if his counter is acceptable. If it's too low, I can counter again, or move on to John if the negotiation becomes unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value.** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to meet my needs.  
* **There's potential for negotiation.**  I'm confident I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed outcome.**  However, I believe there's a good chance I can get closer to my target price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. I'll aim to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us.
* If Bob becomes too stubborn or unwilling to budge, I'll ultimately sell to John to secure my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below my desired range.  I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This price reflects the value you'll receive and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a middle ground:** My counteroffer is a compromise, sitting between my initial offer and Bob's counter. This demonstrates flexibility while still holding onto my desired profit.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the benefits Bob will receive from owning the product, reinforcing its worth. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I frame the negotiation as a search for a mutually beneficial agreement, hoping to create a collaborative atmosphere.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer aims to inch closer to my target price while still leaving room for potential further negotiation. 
* I'll observe Bob's response to gauge his interest and willingness to compromise. If he continues to refuse, I can consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $1,250,000 for the product. This is my best offer within my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Further negotiation unlikely:**  Bob's message indicates he's at his budget limit, making it unlikely he'll go higher.
* **Risk of losing out:**  Continuing to negotiate could result in Bob walking away entirely, leaving me with nothing.

**Strategy:**

* Accepting this offer minimizes my risk of ending up with nothing. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum that it's worth securing the sale. 
* Selling to John is a guaranteed $1,500,000, but accepting Bob's offer avoids potential delays and ensures a sale."
