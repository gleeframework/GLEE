"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, and it demonstrates the value I place on the product. I'll keep in mind the value of the product to me ($800,000) and John's offer as a safety net while navigating the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not going to accept the first offer. It's too early in the negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see where it leads."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $950,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a significant profit. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price by continuing this back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. While I'd prefer more, it's closer to my target than John's offer of $800,000. It's also a significant profit, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
