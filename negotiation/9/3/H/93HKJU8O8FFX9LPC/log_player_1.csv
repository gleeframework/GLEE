Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $130, slightly above Bob's perceived value, to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and open to discussion. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By not starting at the absolute maximum, I give Bob a reason to negotiate and potentially reach a price that benefits both of us. 
* **Knowing My Backup:**  I'm confident in my ability to sell to John for $120, which provides a safety net if negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting would result in a loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it demonstrates his interest in the product. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John:** I'm not desperate to sell, as I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120. This gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $115.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with $115, which is closer to my minimum but still allows for some negotiation.
* **Maintain Interest:** I'm keeping the tone positive and  emphasizing that I appreciate Bob's interest, creating a good rapport for continued negotiation.
* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price. This shows Bob I'm open to compromise, making him more likely to negotiate further. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $115 is still above my minimum of $120, allowing me to potentially secure a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for considering my previous offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $115. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $112.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $112.5 is closer to my minimum of $120, it's still below it. Accepting would result in a small loss.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's still a chance for Bob to come up in price. I believe I can potentially push for a higher price, closer to my minimum.
* **Safeguard with John:** I have the option to sell to John for $120, which gives me the security of a guaranteed profit if negotiations with Bob fail.

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer. It will be a small increase but it shows that I'm still willing to negotiate while keeping my minimum in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your hesitation. How about we split the difference and settle on $113.75? That way we both get a little closer to what we're looking for.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 113.75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting a price that's the midpoint between Bob's offer and my previous counteroffer, I demonstrate a willingness to compromise and show that I'm taking his offer seriously. 
* **Small Increase:** The increase from Bob's offer is small, making it less likely for Bob to feel pressured to reject. It's a subtle but effective way to potentially push for a higher price without completely shutting down negotiations. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and encouraging tone, making Bob more likely to consider the counteroffer. 
* **Keeping Options Open:**  I'm still within a range where selling to John remains a viable option if negotiations fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $112.50 again? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No More Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer of $112.5 is the same as his previous offer. It demonstrates that he's not willing to budge further, and continuing to negotiate will likely lead to a stalemate. 
* **Reaching My Limit:**  I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $120. Accepting his offer would result in a loss. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a profit, which is more than what I would make if I accepted Bob's offer. 

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  it's time to move on and secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John."
