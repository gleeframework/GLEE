"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Reason:  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is below his maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my value.  Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Reason:  Alice has come down to $110, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal considering John is selling for $120.  Continuing to negotiate risks going over budget or running out of rounds."
