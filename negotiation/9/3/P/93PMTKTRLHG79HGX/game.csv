"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. My initial offer is $1,750,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and its potential for you. Let's discuss!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need it to be more budget-friendly. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget concerns, $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This price reflects the value of the product and still allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,550,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about meeting in the middle.  However, $1,375,000 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000.  This price allows for a mutually beneficial agreement, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,400,000. This is a competitive offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1,400,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm flexible.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1,425,000.  This would allow me to move forward with the sale, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1425000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I'm willing to budge a bit more. How about $1,410,000? I feel this price acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget.",1410000.0,Bob,8,
