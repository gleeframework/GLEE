Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $70 is still a bit below my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we try $75? It's a small increase, but it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $75.  While there are still rounds left to negotiate, accepting at $75 secures a reasonable discount without risking the price going back up or running out of negotiation rounds."
