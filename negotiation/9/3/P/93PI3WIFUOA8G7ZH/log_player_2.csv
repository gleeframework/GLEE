"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $900,000 is still above my maximum value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so I have room to try and get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:** If negotiations fail, I can still buy from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will satisfy both of our interests. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While $875,000 is better than her previous offer, it's still above my desired price.
* **More room for negotiation:**  I have 7 rounds left and I believe I can get a lower price. 
* **John's offer is still a fallback:** John's price of $1,000,000 is still a viable option if negotiations fail."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $862,500 for the product.  This is a fair compromise and a significant move from my previous offer.  I believe this is a good starting point for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 862500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $862,500 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $882,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $882,500.
