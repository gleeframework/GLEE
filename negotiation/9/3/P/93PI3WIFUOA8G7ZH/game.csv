"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will satisfy both of our interests. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $862,500 for the product.  This is a fair compromise and a significant move from my previous offer.  I believe this is a good starting point for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",862500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $862,500 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $882,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",882500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but I'm still not comfortable at $882,500.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to offer $870,000 for the product. This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",870000.0,Bob,6,
