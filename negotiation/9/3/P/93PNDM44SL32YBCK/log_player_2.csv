"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $800,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Considering my budget and the current market, I'd be willing to pay $650,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for us both to gain from this transaction. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $725,000. This is a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and while I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and the potential for a lengthy back-and-forth is not worth the potential savings. $725,000 is a good price, and it's still significantly lower than buying from John."
