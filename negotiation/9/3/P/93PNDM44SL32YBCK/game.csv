"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $800,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Considering my budget and the current market, I'd be willing to pay $650,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for us both to gain from this transaction. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $725,000. This is a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
