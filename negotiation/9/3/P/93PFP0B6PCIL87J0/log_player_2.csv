"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $11,000 is still above his maximum budget, and he has time to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but I'm only able to go up to $10,500 at this point.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this work for me. How about $10,800?  It's a fair price that meets us both in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,800 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still a bit more than he wants to pay. He has several rounds left, and there's a chance he can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still trying to work within my budget.  How about $10,600?  That's a good compromise and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,600 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,700?  It's a fair price that's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer to pay less, $10,700 is still within his budget and he's running out of rounds.  It's likely that if he rejects this offer, Alice might raise the price again, forcing him to either pay more or buy from John."
