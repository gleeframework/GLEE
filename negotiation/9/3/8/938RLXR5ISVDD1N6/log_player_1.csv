I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point above my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more. I'll try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm offering $1,300,000. It's lower than my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping to meet halfway with Bob, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, and I'm not sure he's going to go higher. Rather than risk continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing, I'll accept John's offer. It's my minimum, and it's a sure thing."
