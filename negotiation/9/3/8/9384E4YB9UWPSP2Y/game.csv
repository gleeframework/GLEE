"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident that the value you'll derive from it will far exceed the price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a significant discount from your original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This price allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm confident that the product will be worth it to me, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. How about $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price that benefits both of us. It's a win-win situation, and I'm confident you'll find this product incredibly valuable.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider other options.",920000.0,Bob,6,
