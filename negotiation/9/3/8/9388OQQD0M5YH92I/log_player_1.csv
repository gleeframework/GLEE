Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

 I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $7,000 is getting closer to my floor price of $8,000, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also aware that I could sell the product to John for $8,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,800.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $7,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it. I'm getting close to my target, and I'm hoping we can meet on this price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  I've negotiated with Bob for several rounds, and it seems unlikely that he's willing to pay a price that's close to my minimum price of $8,000.  Rather than continue to negotiate and risk ending up with a lower price, I'm going to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
