"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest.  This leaves room for negotiation, while still reflecting the significant value of the product to me.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to assess his counteroffer and make a more informed decision in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is a decent offer, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my valuation.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility, but it still reflects the value of the product to me.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and we're nearing the halfway point of our negotiations.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and secures a profit, though it's less than I initially hoped for. I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better offer in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
