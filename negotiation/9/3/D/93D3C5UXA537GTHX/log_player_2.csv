"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  Bob has other options, including buying from John, so there's no need to rush into an overpriced deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be interested in buying it for $120.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with his maximum price point, aiming to see if Alice is willing to come down to his value limit. This counteroffer sets the stage for negotiation while ensuring Bob doesn't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $120 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above his ideal price. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal. Additionally, Bob still has the option to buy from John for $120, giving him leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $150 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $135.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility while still staying within his budget. He's increased his offer from $120 to $135, showing a willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down, but also leaves room for further compromise."
