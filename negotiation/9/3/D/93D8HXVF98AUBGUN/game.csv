"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on a high-quality item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can do even better than that.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $12500. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $13500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but $13500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of $12000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to pay a premium for the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $12000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $13000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make one last compromise, Alice, but I'm afraid $13000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to go above $12000. I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price, but if not, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
