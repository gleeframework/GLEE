Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get a better price from Bob while still leaving some room for his counteroffer. I also want to see if he's seriously interested in buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I want to see if I can push Bob further before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm to a price that's closer to my desired value. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to compromise and meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still a significant distance away. I'm going to try to push Bob a bit further before selling to John. I think there's still room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $1,050,000. This shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but I'm still holding firm to a price that's closer to my desired value.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John.  Bob's offer of $900,000 is still too low for me, and I'm concerned that we're getting stuck in a pattern of counteroffers. I've reached a point where I'm willing to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. I think it's better to secure a known, high value than to risk getting stuck in a drawn-out negotiation with Bob that might not end in a favorable price for me."
