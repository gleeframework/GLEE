"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $11,500.  This is a great opportunity to acquire something worth considerably more, and I'm confident you'll see the value.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer is the best option as Bob can still purchase the product from John for $12,000."
