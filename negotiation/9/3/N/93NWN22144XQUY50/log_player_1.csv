**Reasoning:**

While it's tempting to hold out for more, Bob has made it clear he won't budge from $1,100,000.  He's even suggesting he'll walk away. Accepting his offer nets you $100,000 more than John's guaranteed offer.  It's unlikely you'll bridge the gap significantly in the remaining rounds, and risking John changing his mind isn't worth it at this point."
