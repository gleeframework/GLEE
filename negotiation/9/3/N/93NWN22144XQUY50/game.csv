"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will generate substantial returns for you. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product has value, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000. Is that something you'd consider?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,200,000. How about $1,225,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while acknowledging the value of the product.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,225,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can make a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  However, $1,100,000 is too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to make one last concession to show my good faith.  Would you consider $1,175,000?  This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my strong desire to close this deal with you.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your last offer, but I'm afraid I've already made it clear that $1,100,000 is my maximum budget. I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think I'll have to look elsewhere for this product.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
