"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a special price of $1,000,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price lower than its market value.  I understand you value it at $800,000, and this offer gives you a significant margin for profit. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be moving on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $1,000,000, which is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.
* You can get the product from John for $800,000, which is within your budget. 
* It makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save $200,000."
