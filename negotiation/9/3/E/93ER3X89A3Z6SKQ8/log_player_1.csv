"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a strong opening offer that leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value of $8,000. I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value of $10,000 as possible without risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my desired outcome. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price. I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good price for me and likely more appealing to Bob than his last offer.  It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal, I'm still confident I can push for a higher price. I have 6 rounds left and I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the value of my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,900. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair price that demonstrates my flexibility while also closing in on a profitable outcome. I have 5 rounds left, so there's still room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,800 is close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept. We're now only $200 apart from my initial target of $9,000.  While I'm happy to have closed a deal, I'll keep in mind that this negotiation style can be used in future deals to maximize profit!"
