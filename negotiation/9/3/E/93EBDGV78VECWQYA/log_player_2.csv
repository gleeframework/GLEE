"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are aiming to pay no more than $15,000, and Alice is asking for $12,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, and you know Alice is willing to sell for less than $12,000 (since her value is $8,000).
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  You can always buy from John, so you have no pressure to accept Alice's first offer.

**Next steps:** You will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:**  Starting with a lower price shows your commitment to saving money and encourages Alice to negotiate.
* **Middle ground:** $10,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer but leaves room for negotiation. It also accounts for Alice's value of $8,000. 

**Next steps:**  Wait for Alice's response. If she rejects, you'll have to decide if you want to make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is the same as Round 1.**  She's not budging from her initial price, showing she might be unwilling to negotiate.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You know Alice is willing to sell for less, and you still have 7 rounds left.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  You're not pressured to accept Alice's offer, as you can always buy from John.

**Next steps:** You will make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get a lower price. You might consider a slightly higher counteroffer than $10,000 to see if Alice is willing to move closer to your price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase:** This counteroffer shows you are willing to meet Alice halfway, but still aiming for a lower price. 
* **Testing the waters:**  A $1,000 increase from your previous offer might encourage Alice to consider a lower price.
* **Still lower than Alice's offer:** $11,000 is still less than Alice's $12,000. 

**Next steps:** Wait for Alice's response. If she rejects, you'll have to decide if you want to make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than desired:** $13,000 is still a significant amount for you.
* **Alice is being stubborn:**  She's raised her price from $12,000 to $13,000, showing resistance to lowering the price.
* **Time for a counteroffer:** You still have 5 rounds to reach a deal. 

**Next steps:** You need to consider if a counteroffer is worth it. You could try a slight increase from your previous offer or make a bold move with a lower price. However, be aware that Alice might be unwilling to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  While Alice is being stubborn, you're aiming for a middle ground.  $11,500 is a compromise between your previous $11,000 offer and Alice's $13,000.
* **Pushing the limits:** This is a slightly bolder move than a small increase, potentially encouraging Alice to accept.
* **Still within your budget:** This price is still significantly lower than your $15,000 limit and leaves room for Alice to make a small concession.

**Next steps:**  Wait for Alice's response. If she rejects, you'll need to decide if you want to make another counteroffer or move on to John. The situation is getting tense, and you have fewer rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your limit:** $14,000 is only $1,000 away from your maximum price, but it's still too high for your desired savings.
* **Alice is showing a pattern:** She keeps raising her price, which suggests she may be unwilling to budge further.
* **Time is running out:** You only have 3 rounds left, and it's crucial to keep negotiating to reach a favorable price. 

**Next steps:** You need to consider a counteroffer that is slightly higher than your previous offer but still within your budget. The goal is to get Alice closer to your desired price point, but you'll need to be careful as you only have a few rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This is a significant jump from your previous offer, showing you are willing to meet Alice halfway. 
* **Time pressure:** With only two rounds left, you need to make a bold move to encourage Alice to accept.
* **Risky but potentially rewarding:** If Alice rejects, you might have to buy from John, but there's a chance she might accept to avoid losing the deal completely.

**Next steps:**  Wait for Alice's response. If she rejects, you'll be forced to buy from John. This is your last chance to secure a lower price from Alice."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is your limit:** She's offering the product at your maximum price, leaving no room for negotiation.
* **Only one round left:** This is your last chance, and accepting Alice's offer means you get no savings.
* **Buying from John is the same price:** There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice when you can buy the product from John at the same price.

**Next steps:** It's best to buy from John to avoid further negotiation and ensure you get the product."
