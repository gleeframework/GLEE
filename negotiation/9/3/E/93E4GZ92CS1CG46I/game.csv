"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I see the potential of this product, $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to counteroffer with $1,150,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for some room for negotiation.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counteroffer at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and potential benefits, while also being reasonable for both parties.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
