Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits it can bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I see the potential of this product, $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to counteroffer with $1,150,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for some room for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
