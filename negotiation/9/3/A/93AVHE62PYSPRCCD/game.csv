"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is good, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $750,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $750,000 is closer, but still a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $675,000?",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $675,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $675,000, which would be $712,500. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",712500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. That's still a bit high for me, though. What if we try $690,000? ",690000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm still not comfortable with $690,000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $712,500 and $690,000, which would be $701,250. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",701250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting close!  I can do $695,000, but that's as high as I can go.",695000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm close to accepting, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $695,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $701,250 and $695,000, which would be $698,125. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",698125.0,Alice,9,
