"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I know it's even more valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm sure you'll agree. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Buying from Alice for $10,000 saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John.
* **It's within your budget:** The $10,000 price is less than your maximum budget of $12,000."
