"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the value Bob sees in the product. This should prompt him to counteroffer, giving us room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it might be a good compromise for Bob, considering his initial counteroffer."

While $1,000,000 is a good profit, I believe I can still do better. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."

{""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are getting lower. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $800,000. While it's not ideal, it's better than potentially ending up with a lower price or no deal at all."
