"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little out of my price range.  I'm willing to go to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.
