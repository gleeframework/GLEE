"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $12,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and counteroffer. You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice, or if that fails, you can always buy from John for $8,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better price. If not, you can always go with John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little out of my price range.  I'm willing to go to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $11,000 is still higher than your preferred price range.  It's time to cut your losses and purchase the product from John for $8,000.  You've already made a good effort to negotiate with Alice, but at this point, it's clear that a deal is not possible."
