Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I believe its true value is much higher. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a price that reflects both its potential and my willingness to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also suggests that I'm open to a deal and not just trying to squeeze every dollar out of Bob.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value while also highlighting my willingness to negotiate. This helps build rapport and create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Start high, but be reasonable:** By starting at $1,250,000, I have room to negotiate down if needed, while still ensuring I get a profit.
* **Focus on value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to both of us, which helps justify the price.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I can adjust my offer based on Bob's response, including the possibility of accepting a counteroffer or walking away to sell to John if the price is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired price range.  Since I'm aiming for the highest possible price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I show him that I'm not desperate to sell and I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This gives me leverage in the negotiation.
* **Counteroffer:**  I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point, but still acknowledges Bob's interest.

**Next Steps:**

* I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,250,000. This will involve carefully explaining why my counteroffer is justified and demonstrating the value of the product."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your offer.  While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, I believe this product holds even greater value.  Considering its worth to both of us, I'm willing to compromise by offering it to you for $1,175,000.  This price reflects the potential of the product, and my desire to reach a fair agreement. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $1,175,000 is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still within my desired range. It shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my goal of maximizing profit. 
* **Message:** The message continues to emphasize the product's value, while also acknowledging Bob's offer and demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  It's also phrased in a way that invites further discussion.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation tactic:** By starting at $1,250,000 and now offering $1,175,000, I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway. This could encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Focus on value:** The message continues to highlight the product's value to both of us, reinforcing the justification for the price. 
* **Remain open to negotiation:**  I'm ready to adjust my offer again if needed, but I want to make sure I get as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1075000 is a more reasonable price for me. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,075,000 is very close to John's offer of $1,000,000.  While I'm still hoping for a higher price, the negotiation seems to be stalling, and I don't want to risk getting stuck in a lengthy back-and-forth.  

**Strategy:**

* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time and may not lead to a significantly higher price. 
* **Secure the deal:**  Selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees a sale and provides a reliable income.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept John's offer and move on to other opportunities."
