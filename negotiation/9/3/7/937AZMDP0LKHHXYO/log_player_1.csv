Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $9,500.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $9,500 gives Bob a perceived ""deal"" and allows room for him to negotiate down slightly if he wants, while still keeping me well above my minimum price.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going straight to $10,000 might make Bob feel like he has no room to negotiate and could scare him off. 
 
By starting high but not unreasonable, I increase my chances of securing a sale price significantly higher than my backup offer from John."
