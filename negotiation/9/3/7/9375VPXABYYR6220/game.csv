"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,300,000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $2,300,000 represents the premium value of this product, I understand your perspective. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to accept $2,000,000. I believe this reflects a fair price considering its potential worth to your specific needs.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  However, $2,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly seeing the inherent value in this product. I respect your position.  Let's aim for a win-win. I'd be willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the significant value it holds and represents my final offer.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to pay $1,850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we've both agreed upon. Let's make this deal happen.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
