"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high.  It's above Bob's maximum budget and leaves significant room for negotiation. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,300,000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $2,300,000 represents the premium value of this product, I understand your perspective. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to accept $2,000,000. I believe this reflects a fair price considering its potential worth to your specific needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is still too high for Bob.  While it's a reduction from the initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  However, $2,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly seeing the inherent value in this product. I respect your position.  Let's aim for a win-win. I'd be willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the significant value it holds and represents my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for Bob.  While it's getting closer to Bob's ideal price, he can still potentially get a better deal. Bob should continue to negotiate to try and get the price down to $1,800,000 or lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to pay $1,850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we've both agreed upon. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1850000}
