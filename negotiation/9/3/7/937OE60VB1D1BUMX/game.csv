"Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate you being willing to work with me.  However, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,250. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $9,250 is still a little outside my budget.  Would you consider $8,750? It's a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,250 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $9,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",9000.0,Alice,5,
