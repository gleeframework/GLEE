Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give me room to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob considering he values it at $10,000. 
* **Positive Message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive way to encourage acceptance.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a successful sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer, taking into account my minimum acceptable price ($15,000 from John) and the potential for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While it's closer to my ideal, I'm not willing to accept anything lower than my backup offer of $15,000 from John.
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price:**  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. 

**Next Steps:** 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $12,000.  I will be mindful of Bob's willingness to negotiate and my own minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with Compromise:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get for the product, hoping to sway him.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation open.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've successfully negotiated a higher price than his initial offer.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to weigh his potential counteroffer and my backup offer from John before making a decision."
