"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you in the middle, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still aiming for $10,000, but I'm willing to go a little higher. How about $10,500? This would be a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10,500, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. While I appreciate the concession, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'll make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $12,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,7,
