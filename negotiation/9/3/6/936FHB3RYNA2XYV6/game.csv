"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I see you're really trying to find a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $10,125.  It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",10125.0,Alice,5,
