"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's value of $10,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, I'm only able to offer $11,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above Alice's value of $10,000, making it a potential win-win.
* **Room for Compromise:** There's still room for negotiation, as Bob can go up to $15,000. This approach allows for potential compromise without immediately jeopardizing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $12,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $13,000, it's still more than Bob's target of saving as much money as possible.  He's willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not able to meet $12,000.  How about $11,500?  It's a fair price that gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer. It shows that Bob is willing to negotiate while still trying to get a good price.
* **Moving the Needle:**  This counteroffer is a subtle move closer to Alice's price, suggesting that Bob is serious about making a deal.
* **Staying Within Limits:**  $11,500 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John."
