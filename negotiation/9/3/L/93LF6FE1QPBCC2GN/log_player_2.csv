Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $14,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer! I'm willing to come down a bit more to $15,500.  This is a very fair price for this product, and I think it reflects the value it would bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000.  While we're getting closer, I don't want to risk going over budget. I'm better off buying from John, who has already agreed to sell me the product for $12,000."
