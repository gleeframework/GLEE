I'm starting with a lower counteroffer of $10,000 to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. It's a significant drop from her initial offer, but it's still within the range of my budget."

Alice's offer is getting close to my limit, but we only have one round left. I'm not confident I can get her lower in a single round, and I don't want to risk being stuck with a price I'm not happy with. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
