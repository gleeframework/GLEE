"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet all your needs and expectations. Given its high quality and functionality, we believe it's worth $80. Would you like to make this investment and experience the benefits firsthand? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product at the exact price you're willing to pay. Since you have a backup option with John who is also selling the product for $80, there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer. You can reject it and still get the product for the same price."
