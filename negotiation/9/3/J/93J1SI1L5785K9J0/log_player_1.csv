Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for a profit, and $120 is well above your $80 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  He values the product at $150, so you have room to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and friendly message:**  You're establishing a positive tone and setting clear expectations. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, you can still potentially get more.  Bob is clearly interested and you have room to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and try to secure a price closer to your initial $120 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is a little too low for me right now.  Would you consider $110? It's still a great price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While you initially aimed for a higher price, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and you've already lowered your price twice.  Accepting his offer at $105 ensures a sale and a decent profit, as it's significantly more than selling to John for $80. It's also likely that further negotiations will only result in a smaller price difference, making this a good compromise."
