"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000.  This product is worth $1,000,000 to you, so I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would give you a good price and still ensure a fair profit for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
