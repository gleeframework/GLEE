"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Since Bob is willing to pay up to $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000.  This product is worth $1,000,000 to you, so I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would give you a good price and still ensure a fair profit for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000, and it's closer to Bob's desired price of $1,200,000.  Accepting the offer ensures a good deal for Bob without risking further negotiation that might lead to a higher price or a stalemate."
