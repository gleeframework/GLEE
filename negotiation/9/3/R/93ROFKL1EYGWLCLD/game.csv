"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $12,800. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,3,
