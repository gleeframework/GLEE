"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget, but $6,000 is quite low for the value this product offers. To find a middle ground, how about we consider $12,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While the product is good, $12,000 is still too high for me. Could you consider something closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing that we're both interested in making a deal here.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,500?  That's my final offer.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to go up to $7,500. If that works, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",7500.0,Bob,6,
