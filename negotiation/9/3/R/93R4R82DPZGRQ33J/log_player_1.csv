"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget, but $6,000 is quite low for the value this product offers. To find a middle ground, how about we consider $12,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While the product is good, $12,000 is still too high for me. Could you consider something closer to $7,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to go up to $7,500. If that works, I'm ready to close the deal right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to move much beyond his $7,500 offer. It's clear that getting him closer to our desired price will be difficult.  Selling to John for $10,000 ensures a guaranteed return and avoids further negotiation."
