Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob, giving you significant room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:**  You need to make at least $80 (from John if Bob declines).
* **Targeting High:** Starting with a strong offer of $120 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit margin if Bob accepts immediately. 
* **Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and presents the offer as a ""deal,"" increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
