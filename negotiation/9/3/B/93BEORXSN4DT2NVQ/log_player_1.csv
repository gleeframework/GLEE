Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I really appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $115? Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can get closer to my asking price.  $115 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $115 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $122.50? This feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 122.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $122.50 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to pay $118.75.  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118.75
