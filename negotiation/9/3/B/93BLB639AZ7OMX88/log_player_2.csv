"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. This price allows for a significant profit for you while still being within my acceptable range.  Let me know your decision.  If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her initial asking price, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to buy the product for a lower price from John."
