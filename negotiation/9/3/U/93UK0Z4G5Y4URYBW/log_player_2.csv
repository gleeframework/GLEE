"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $140 for it, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too close to my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal. 
* **Aiming for Under Budget:** My ideal outcome is to get the price below $120.  
* **Considering Alternatives:**  I'm keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $150 if negotiations don't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I'm sure you'll find it worth the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is meeting me closer to the middle, which is good. However, $125 is still above her value for the item. I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll counter slightly below her offer to see if she's willing to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $120? That's a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's directly in between our previous offers. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a favorable price.
* **Testing Her Limit:** Offering $120 (her value) will reveal if she's willing to accept a smaller profit margin to close the deal. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We're approaching the halfway point in the negotiation. I want to reach a decision soon or consider buying from John."
