Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, you're a tough negotiator!  Tell you what, let's wrap this up. I'll accept $125, that's my final offer.

It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. She's unlikely to go below $125, and you have a guaranteed option with John for $120.  You've negotiated well, but sometimes the best deals come from knowing your alternatives!"
