"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  That's a good compromise and allows us both to get a fair deal. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750. Can you meet me at this price?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750, as I mentioned earlier. It's the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping you can meet me at this price.",8750.0,Bob,6,
