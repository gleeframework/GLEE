"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting price is way too high. It's much better to negotiate and see if she'll come down significantly before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 60}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good tactic in negotiation to start with a lower offer than your target price. This gives you room to bargain upwards and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Significant Difference:** The counter-offer of $60 is substantially lower than Alice's initial ask of $120. This might encourage her to re-evaluate her pricing and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Leaving Negotiation Space:** By offering $60, Bob leaves ample room for further negotiation within his $80 budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $60 is quite low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above Bob's budget. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob the chance to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about $70? That's a fair offer, and I'm eager to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 70}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:** Bob is signaling his willingness to negotiate by increasing his offer from $60 to $70. 
* **Staying Below Budget:** This counteroffer keeps him within his $80 budget, ensuring he doesn't overspend.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By expressing eagerness to make a deal, Bob adds a subtle sense of urgency, which might encourage Alice to accept or offer a price closer to his target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $85,  and we have a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is definitely getting closer to Bob's budget, but he can still try to get the price down a little further. It's worth one more counteroffer before accepting a price above John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, you're really close! I'm happy to close the deal right now for $75. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 75}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her last offer of $85 and Bob's previous offer of $70. It shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below his maximum.
* **Urgency and Clarity:** By saying he's ""happy to close the deal right now,"" Bob conveys a sense of urgency and a clear desire to finalize the purchase. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Bob is getting close to his limit. If Alice doesn't accept this offer, he might have to seriously consider buying from John in the next round or two."
