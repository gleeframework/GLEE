"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming to maximize profit, so starting with a strong offer ($1,300,000) anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer gives us room to negotiate down if needed, while still staying well above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and encouraging discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,500,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  Bob's counter-offer indicates he's willing to pay a significant amount, but we have room to push for a better deal.  Rejecting keeps the door open for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying Value:**  The message reaffirms that the product is worth a significant amount while acknowledging Bob's counter-offer.
* **Compromise:**  Meeting in the middle ($1,250,000) is a common negotiation tactic, showing flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Clear Justification:**  By explaining the reasoning behind the counter-offer, we maintain transparency and encourage Bob to consider our perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I still aim to keep my investment within $1,500,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,225,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,225,000 is a substantial profit margin above our minimum ($800,000). 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob's counteroffers have consistently moved closer to our desired price range. This indicates he's serious about buying and less likely to walk away from a deal close to his initial offer.
* **Time Value:** We still have several rounds left, but continuing to negotiate for a relatively small increase might risk Bob losing interest or lowering his offer. Accepting now secures a very favorable deal."
