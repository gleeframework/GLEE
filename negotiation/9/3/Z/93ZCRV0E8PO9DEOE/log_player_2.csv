# Alice's message: Bob, you're a tough negotiator, and I appreciate that. $12,000 is my absolute bottom line, but I'm willing to throw in [mention a small but tangible add-on - maybe a service contract, expedited shipping, etc.] to sweeten the deal at that price. Do we have an agreement?

This is a good deal! Alice has reached her bottom line, and getting a small add-on makes this offer even better than buying from John for $15,000."
