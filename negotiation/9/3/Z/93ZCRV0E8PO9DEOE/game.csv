"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $13,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,500.  Would that work for you?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  While I can't do $11,500, I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  That's a significant price cut and a fair offer considering its value.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're a tough negotiator, and I appreciate that. $12,000 is my absolute bottom line, but I'm willing to throw in [mention a small but tangible add-on - maybe a service contract, expedited shipping, etc.] to sweeten the deal at that price. Do we have an agreement?",12000.0,Alice,7,
