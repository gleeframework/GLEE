"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,500. This is a fair price given the value to me and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,500 is your final offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your offer. How about $14,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to reach an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,5,
