"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm offering it to you for $700,000. I believe this is a great deal, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $550,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $650,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm offering the product to you for $620,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $620,000.

This seems like the best time to accept. Alice is firm on her price and it's a reasonable compromise. Waiting any longer might make her pull out of the deal entirely and then the only option is John's $800,000 offer."
