"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm offering it to you for $700,000. I believe this is a great deal, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $700,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $550,000?",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $550,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $650,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $600,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $600,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm offering the product to you for $620,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",620000.0,Alice,5,
