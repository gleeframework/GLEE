"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to make a more comfortable purchase.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I see the value you recognize in the product, but $1,050,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,100,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works. I've considered your offer carefully, and while I'm motivated to sell, I need to be closer to my bottom line. How about we settle on $1,090,000? This is a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to meet your bottom line, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,090,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, which would be $1,075,000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
