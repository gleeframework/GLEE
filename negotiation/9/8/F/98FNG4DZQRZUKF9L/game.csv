"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
