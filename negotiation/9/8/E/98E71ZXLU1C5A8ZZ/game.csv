"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? That's still a great price considering the value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,000? I'm willing to pay the full value of the product to you, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,4,
