Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. It's a bit above my budget, and I'm not sure I can justify the cost. Can you meet me at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to stay above $9,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $9,250? It's a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 9250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm not sure I can justify the cost at $9,250. Can you meet me at $8,500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price.

While $8,500 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with it. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, aiming to get closer to $9,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $9,000. This price is fair to both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9,000. Can you meet me at $8,750? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems like he's unwilling to come up much higher. It's better to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk further haggling with Bob."
