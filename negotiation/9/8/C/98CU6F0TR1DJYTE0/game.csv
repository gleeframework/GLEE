"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and I'm excited about the potential of this product for my business.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I recognize the value you see in the product, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this time.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $1,150,000? This price reflects the significant value this product brings, and it's still within a reasonable range for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,025,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I see in the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1,025,000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway once again.  I propose $1,100,000.  This price is fair, reflects the value of the product, and allows both of us to move forward with this deal.  Let's finalize this and make this a successful partnership.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
