Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  $1,500,000 (the least you'll accept)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **John's Value (your safety net):** $1,500,000

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your reservation price. This allows you to push for a higher price with Bob. However, you need to leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal to incentivize him to buy.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** We start above Bob's perceived value but below your guaranteed sale price. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""significant returns""  helps justify the price and shifts the focus from a pure number.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**: Creates a sense of scarcity and importance.

**Outcome**

* **If Bob Accepts:** You make a profit above Bob's valuation.
* **If Bob Rejects:** You sell to John at your reservation price.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly downward, but remember, you have a strong alternative with John."
