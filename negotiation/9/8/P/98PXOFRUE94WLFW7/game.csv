"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price given its worth to you. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, and I understand your perspective on the price. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
