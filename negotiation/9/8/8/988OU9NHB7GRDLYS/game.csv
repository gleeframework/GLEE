"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,800,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its market value. To be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $1,600,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  That's a fair bit closer to your valuation while still working within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, You're right, we're getting closer. How about we settle this at $1,450,000?  That's my final offer, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
