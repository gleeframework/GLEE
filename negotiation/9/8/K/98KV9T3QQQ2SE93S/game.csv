"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be interested in buying it for $90. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $110, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $105? I really do want this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I can do $108, which is the best I can do. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",108.0,Alice,5,
