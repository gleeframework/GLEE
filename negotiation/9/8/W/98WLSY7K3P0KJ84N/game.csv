"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still gives you a great deal, as you've indicated the product is worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That's a significant saving for me and still a good deal for you.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
