"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe could be highly beneficial for you.  Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and leaves room for us to close a deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe the value this product brings to your specific needs warrants a higher price.  Would you consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its potential.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still not quite there.  Considering the product's worth to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us and allows for a successful transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
