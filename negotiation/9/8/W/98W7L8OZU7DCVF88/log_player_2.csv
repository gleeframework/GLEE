"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe could be highly beneficial for you.  Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still significantly higher than the product's value to Alice ($800,000).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and leaves room for us to close a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe the value this product brings to your specific needs warrants a higher price.  Would you consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. While $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still not quite there.  Considering the product's worth to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us and allows for a successful transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
