Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe could be highly beneficial for you.  Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and leaves room for us to close a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
We're still significantly above John's offer, so it's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe the value this product brings to your specific needs warrants a higher price.  Would you consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its potential."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

Here's why we chose this approach:

* **Splitting the difference:** We're coming down from our initial offer, but not drastically. This shows we're willing to negotiate but also confident in the product's worth.
* **Highlighting Bob's benefit:** By reiterating the value specific to Bob, we're subtly reminding him why the higher price is justified. 
* **""Fair compromise"" language:**  This frames the offer in a positive way, encouraging Bob to see it as mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still not quite there.  Considering the product's worth to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us and allows for a successful transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

This is a great outcome! We've managed to secure a deal for $200,000 more than John's offer.  While we could potentially push for more, there's always the risk of Bob walking away. It's best to accept this strong offer now."
