"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $22,000 is far above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but you have room to significantly lower the price. You should reject the offer and counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  You're offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, establishing your willingness to negotiate.
* **Budget Awareness:** You've stated your budget constraint, making your offer seem more realistic.
* **Fairness:** You've framed your counteroffer as a ""fair price,"" implying a potential compromise.

This strategy aims to initiate a more serious discussion while leaving room for potential concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept. Would you consider meeting in the middle at $18,000? I'm motivated to find a solution, and I believe this price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, $18,000 is still above your maximum. It's important to continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to your target.  You can counteroffer again, aiming to inch closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $18,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents the absolute maximum I can pay.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  You're showing a willingness to compromise by increasing your offer, but only slightly. This keeps the pressure on Alice.
* **Maximum Budget:** You're reiterating your budget constraint, making it clear that there's no wiggle room above this price.
* **Common Ground:**  You're suggesting a desire for a deal, but on your terms.

This counteroffer positions you as a serious buyer while maintaining leverage in the negotiation."
