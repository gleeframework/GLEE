Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $90 is closer to where I want to be, but I'm still hoping to finalize the deal at $88.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 88}

Round 5
Alice's offer:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is continuing to come down in price, but $92 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay. With several rounds left, it's worth pushing for a lower price. You can likely get Alice down to your target of $88 with a few more counteroffers."

```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's latest offer while staying within your budget. It shows a willingness to reach a deal while keeping the pressure on Alice to come down just a bit more."
