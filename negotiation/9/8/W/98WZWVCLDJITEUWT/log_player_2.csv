"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is only worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $130. 
* **You have better options:** You can either counteroffer Alice or buy from John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  Offering $90 is significantly lower than Alice's offer, showing you're serious about saving money. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** While $90 is close to your maximum, it allows for Alice to potentially counter with a price closer to your target. 
* **Strategic:** This initial counteroffer sets the stage for a potential compromise, hopefully getting the price closer to $100 in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your maximum value of $100. 
* **John's offer is more attractive:** You can get the product from John for $100, a guaranteed better price than Alice's current offer. 
* **Negotiation room:** While it's tempting to accept, you still have rounds to negotiate with Alice, potentially getting a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  This offer is halfway between your previous offer and Alice's latest, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Still within your range:**  $105 is slightly above your maximum value, but it's a reasonable compromise if Alice is serious about selling.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to come down further, and potentially set up a successful negotiation in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** Alice's offer is closer to your maximum but still above $100. 
* **John's offer is a safe bet:** You have a guaranteed deal with John at $100, and the risk of further negotiation with Alice might not be worth it with only a few rounds left.
* **Negotiation room:**  There's a chance you could get a better price from Alice, but the risk of reaching the end of the rounds without a deal is significant."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is your final offer and your maximum value for the product. There is no room for further compromise.
* **Time pressure:** With only 4 rounds remaining, it's time to push for a final decision.
* **Decision point for Alice:** This offer forces Alice to choose between selling at a lower price or potentially missing the sale entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  With only 3 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal is too high.
* **Alice's offer is close, but not close enough:**  While $108 is only slightly above your maximum, it's not worth the risk of potentially getting a worse outcome in the next few rounds.
* **John's offer is secure:**  You have a guaranteed deal with John for $100, which is a safe and acceptable option given the time constraint. 

By buying from John, you ensure a deal while also maximizing your potential savings."
