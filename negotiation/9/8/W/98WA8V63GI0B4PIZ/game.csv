"Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To make this work, I can come down to $14,000.  This is my best offer, as I know I have other interested buyers.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14,000, but it's still outside my range.  I'm firm on $8,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic.  While I want to find a solution, I have other potential buyers.  I can go as low as $12,000.  However, this is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
