"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me is only $10000. I'm willing to meet in the middle and make a compromise. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. Considering the product's value to me is $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. I'm thinking of a price of $11500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $10500, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can you consider this offer? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about staying within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10500, as it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm thinking of a price of $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to make one more counteroffer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $11250. This is the maximum I can stretch to, and I hope you can consider this offer. I'm really interested in the product, and I don't want to give up on it yet.",11250.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11250. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm thinking of a price of $12800. This is a compromise between our last offers, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal.
