"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer. $950,000 is more than your maximum budget of $800,000, and you can get the product for that price from John.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 for it. It's the maximum I'm willing to pay. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits the product will bring to your business and personal life. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still higher than your budget of $800,000. You can buy the product for your maximum price from John, so it's not worth continuing negotiations with Alice."
