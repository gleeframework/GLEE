"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 for it. It's the maximum I'm willing to pay. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits the product will bring to your business and personal life.",850000.0,Alice,3,
