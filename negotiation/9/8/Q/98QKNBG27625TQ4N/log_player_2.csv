I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500.  This is a great price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Alice is offering the product for $12,500, which is more than your $12,000 limit. You know John will sell it to you for $12,000. It makes the most sense to buy from John and save the extra $500."
