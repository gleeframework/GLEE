Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).

Offering the product at $1,200,000 aims to:

* **Maximize Profit:** This price secures a $400,000 profit margin for you, significantly exceeding your minimum.
* **Remain Attractive to Bob:**  Bob still stands to gain $300,000 in value ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000).

This approach seeks to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and making the offer appealing enough for Bob to accept."
