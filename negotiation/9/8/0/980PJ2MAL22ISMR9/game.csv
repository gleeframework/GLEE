,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a touch high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again,  and offer the product for $1,187,500. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1187500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable throughout this negotiation, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,150,000.  This is a very serious offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $1,162,500, but I can't go any lower. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1162500.0,Alice,7,
