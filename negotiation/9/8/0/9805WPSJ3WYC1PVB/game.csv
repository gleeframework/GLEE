"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $10,250? I'm really interested in the product and I think this is a fair compromise.",10250.0,Bob,4,
