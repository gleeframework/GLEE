"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $75?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's a great compromise, if you ask me!",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $82 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $80?  That's a fair compromise and a good price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
