"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$90 is a good price, but you can potentially get a better deal.** You're willing to pay up to $120, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **You have 10 rounds to work with.** This gives you time to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $75?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:** $75 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still within your budget. This shows you're serious about buying but are also willing to negotiate.
* **Be polite and offer a reason:** Explaining that $75 is a ""fair price"" adds a touch of logic to your request and may encourage Alice to consider it.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  There's still some wiggle room between $75 and your maximum price of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's a great compromise, if you ask me! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is willing to negotiate:** She's lowered her price from $90 to $82, which indicates she's flexible. 
* **You still have room to negotiate:**  $82 is still above your ideal price, and you have several rounds left to try and get a better deal. 
* **Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice:** By rejecting, you show you're not desperate and are prepared to walk away if necessary. This could encourage her to make a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $82 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $80?  That's a fair compromise and a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continue showing willingness to negotiate:**  By offering $80, you demonstrate that you're serious about buying but still want to get a better deal. This keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Offer a reasonable compromise:** $80 is a small step down from Alice's offer, showing you're not trying to exploit her.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""good price for both of us"" helps keep the negotiation friendly.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** You still have a bit of wiggle room between $80 and your maximum price of $120."
