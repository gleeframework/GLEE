,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and go with $11250? That way we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $11250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to your offer. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think we can do better. How about we meet in the middle between $10000 and $10500? I'm willing to offer $10250",10250.0,Bob,6,
