"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's always best to start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable offer:**  $200 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but it might be tempting for Bob if he truly values the product.
* **Open communication:**  The message sets a friendly tone and encourages Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic negotiation:** While $150 is your minimum, accepting Bob's offer right away would give him the impression that you were desperate. 
* **Room for improvement:** It's still early in the negotiation process, and there's a chance you can get a higher price.
* **Counteroffer potential:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer, potentially securing a price closer to your desired $200."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $150 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $175? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 175} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Meeting Bob halfway shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Value proposition:**  Highlighting that $175 is still a good deal for Bob emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Staying firm:**  $175 is still a good price for me, but it signals that I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I would like to propose $160 as a compromise. This still allows me to stay within my spending limit while being fair to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the target:**  $160 is only $10 away from my desired $175, and considering the limited rounds left, accepting his offer seems like a good strategic move. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to further rejections and risk selling to John for a lower price.
* **Reasonable compromise:** Bob has shown willingness to compromise, and $160 is still a good deal for me."
