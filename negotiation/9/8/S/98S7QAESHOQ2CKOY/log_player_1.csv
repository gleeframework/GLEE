Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point for negotiation. It's significantly higher than my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. If he rejects, I'll consider lowering the price a bit in subsequent counteroffers.  However, I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John for $8,000 if I feel the negotiation is not going in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this price will be agreeable to Bob, as it's still significantly higher than my minimum value of $8,000. If he rejects again, I might consider lowering my price further in subsequent counteroffers, but I'll always keep the option to sell to John at $8,000 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $9,200 is a good price. It's significantly higher than my minimum value of $8,000, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome. Additionally, I'm running the risk of Bob walking away and selling to someone else. I'm satisfied with the deal and it's time to close it."
