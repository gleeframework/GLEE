{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($1,200,000). 
* **Strong but Not Greedy:**  A price too close to $1,500,000 might make Bob feel like he has no room to negotiate and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming to secure the best possible deal with Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
