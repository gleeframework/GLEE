"I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,400,000 is too low for the value this product provides.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,700,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
