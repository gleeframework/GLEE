"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $8000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.
* There's a chance to negotiate a lower price with Alice. 
* Buying from John is a guaranteed price of $8,000, but it's worth exploring if you can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above the product's value to me. This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.
* I'm leaving room for negotiation. Alice may counter with a price closer to my offer. 
* If Alice rejects, I still have the option of buying from John for $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $7500, I'm willing to come down to $8500. This still leaves room for you to get a good deal, and it's closer to my bottom line. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.
* I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try and get a better price.
* It's possible Alice is willing to go lower, especially if I'm persistent. 
* If Alice doesn't budge, I can always purchase from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,250?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and meet her halfway. 
* This offer is still below my maximum budget of $8,000, leaving some room for negotiation. 
* I'm framing it as a ""fair price"" for both of us, appealing to Alice's sense of reason. 
* If Alice rejects, I'm prepared to buy from John for $8,000."
