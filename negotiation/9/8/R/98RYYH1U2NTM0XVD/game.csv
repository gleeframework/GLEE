"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $7500, I'm willing to come down to $8500. This still leaves room for you to get a good deal, and it's closer to my bottom line. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $8250?  It's a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
