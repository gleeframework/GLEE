"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives you a healthy profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What are your thoughts?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value you're placing on this product, but $11,500 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This reflects a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you at $12,250. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth and gives me a reasonable profit. What are your thoughts?",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your efforts to compromise, $12,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This shows I'm taking your offer seriously and willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you at $12,750. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth and gives me a reasonable profit. I'm starting to think that we might not be able to meet in the middle, but I'm willing to keep negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price. What are your thoughts?",12750.0,Alice,7,
