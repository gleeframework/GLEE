"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your budget.**  You're aiming for a price under $15,000, and $12,000 is already too high.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup.**  Knowing you can buy from John for $15,000 gives you leverage in your negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives you a healthy profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a step closer to your desired price, it's still over your budget.
* **Negotiation is still possible.** You have several rounds remaining, and by rejecting the offer you keep the pressure on Alice to lower her price.
* **Buying from John is still a backup.** You have a fallback option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value you're placing on this product, but $11,500 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This reflects a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you at $12,250. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth and gives me a reasonable profit. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's come down a bit, $12,250 is still above your budget and outside your desired range.
* **Negotiation is still possible.** You have several rounds remaining and Alice is showing some willingness to compromise.
* **Buying from John is a backup.** This option is always available, but you're trying to get a better deal with Alice.

**Counter-Offer Strategy:**

In the next round, you should make a counteroffer slightly higher than your previous one, but still below Alice's offer.  Aim for a price around $11,500. This shows that you are willing to negotiate, but you are also setting a firm limit on your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your efforts to compromise, $12,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This shows I'm taking your offer seriously and willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you at $12,750. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth and gives me a reasonable profit. I'm starting to think that we might not be able to meet in the middle, but I'm willing to keep negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  $12,750 is outside your target price range and pushing you closer to your backup option.
* **Negotiation seems stalled.** Alice isn't budging much, and her message suggests she's not confident about a deal.
* **Buying from John is the best option now.**  Given the stalled negotiations and Alice's unwillingness to lower her price significantly, it's better to secure the product from John. You'll pay a little more, but you'll avoid the risk of further negotiation rounds that might not lead to a satisfactory outcome."
