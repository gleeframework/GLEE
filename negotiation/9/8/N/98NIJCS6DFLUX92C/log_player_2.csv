"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to  $650,000.  What do you think?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is significantly below the product's value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $975,000.  This is a considerable reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference - $862,500.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is claiming this is her final offer, we still have room to negotiate and are closer to our ideal price.  We're also under our ""buy from John"" price, so there's still a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, I'm on a tight budget and  $862,500 is just a bit beyond what I can justify.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000 even? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Calling the Bluff:** Alice stating her previous offer as ""final"" might be a tactic. We test this by holding firm.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Our offer matches our ""buy from John"" price. This is a strong signal to Alice that we're serious and have an alternative. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate (Slightly):**  While this is our ""final offer"", a small increase might be palatable if Alice absolutely won't budge."
