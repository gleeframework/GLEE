"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to  $650,000.  What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is significantly below the product's value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $975,000.  This is a considerable reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $750,000? That's a significant move on my part.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference - $862,500.  This is my final offer.",862500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, I'm on a tight budget and  $862,500 is just a bit beyond what I can justify.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000 even? This is my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
