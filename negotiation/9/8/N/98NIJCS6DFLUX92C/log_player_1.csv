Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, I'm on a tight budget and  $862,500 is just a bit beyond what I can justify.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000 even? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
