"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price significantly above my minimum. This allows for negotiation room and sets a strong initial expectation.  I'm confident that the product's value to Bob will be revealed through this process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I need to consider his offer and the potential of further negotiation, it's significantly below my minimum.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open, and I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but still holding out for a bit more. This shows Bob I'm serious about getting a good price, but also willing to compromise to get the deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to consider it, but I believe we can reach a better price point. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the deal at a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

I'm making a final attempt to close the deal with Bob. I'm coming down to a price that is only slightly above my minimum but still represents a significant profit.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are running out of time. While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing out on a guaranteed sale to John.  Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum value and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
