Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, securing a deal with Bob at $950,000 still yields a significant profit. 
* **High but Reasonable:** The offered price is high, reflecting the product's value to Alice. However, it's still $50,000 less than Bob's perceived value, potentially enticing him to accept.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** The message creates a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") and scarcity (""other interested parties"") to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly."
