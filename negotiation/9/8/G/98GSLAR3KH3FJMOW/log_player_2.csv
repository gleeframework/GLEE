Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I can meet you in the middle, though. I'll sell it to you for $850,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice is coming down, we can likely get a better deal than $850,000. We're close to our fallback option of buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $750,000? That's a fair price for both of us."",

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you like the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $750,000. I'll meet you at $820,000, and that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go below $820,000, and she's labeled it as her final offer.  It's time to cut our losses and buy from John for $800,000, saving us $20,000."
