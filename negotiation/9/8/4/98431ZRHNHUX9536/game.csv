"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I am interested, that price is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $130. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $120 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you're unable to do that, I understand, but I'm ready to buy it right now for that price.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a firm price for you, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",125.0,Alice,7,
