"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired $150 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is above Bob's perceived value of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a good offer, it's still a bit lower than what I need to sell this product. I'm willing to go down to $140.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I will continue to negotiate with Bob in hopes of reaching a price closer to my $150 minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $110 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $130 is the best price for this product. I'd be willing to pay $115 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for several rounds, but we haven't been able to reach a price that works for both of us. With only a few rounds left, I need to make a decision that maximizes my profit.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees I'll reach my minimum acceptable price and I don't want to risk ending up with a price lower than that."
