Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum value:**  $10,000 is still above my minimum of $12,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth that can lead to a mutually acceptable price.

I'll be prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects my initial price, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500 for your product. I hope this meets within your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to settle. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. I'll make a counteroffer to see if I can reach a mutually acceptable price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to continue negotiating, $9,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I believe we can find a more equitable solution. I am willing to offer $9,600 for your product. This price still allows me to save some money while being fair to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $9,600 is only $400 below my minimum and  represents a decent compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit."
