Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  $175 is higher than $100, so Bob has some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $175 is higher than your minimum of $150, so you're still getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can lower the price if Bob pushes back, but you have some buffer to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  That price is a little high for me, would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum price of $150 and also below what I know John is willing to pay.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** While $125 is still a decent profit for me, it's a significant drop from my initial offer. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer (""too low for me"") and present $125 as a compromise.
* **Focus on Agreement:** The closing line emphasizes finding a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and do $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price. However, I've already had two rounds of negotiation, and it's clear Bob is unwilling to go much higher.  Rather than continuing to haggle, it's more efficient to sell to John for $150. This guarantees a higher profit and avoids further time spent on potentially fruitless negotiation."
