Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to pay up to that amount for this product.

You have three options:

I've reached my limit with Bob. It seems he's not willing to come up to a price that's worth my time. It's time to secure the sale with John at $800,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking losing out entirely."
