Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its true value to me is significantly higher. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm sure it will be a profitable investment for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a high opening offer, but it's crucial to start strong to establish a high baseline.  Since Bob values the product at $800,000, he may be tempted to counter, but this initial offer sets the stage for a good negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you place on the product, but I believe I can only justify purchasing it for $900,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is close to my desired price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal amount, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll derive from the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. I would like to counter with $925,000. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product while respecting your original valuation. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $925,000 is a good compromise. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and brings me closer to my goal.  Furthermore, the risk of further negotiation with Bob might lead to a lower price, and selling to John guarantees $1,000,000 but takes longer."
