"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its true value to me is significantly higher. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm sure it will be a profitable investment for you. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you place on the product, but I believe I can only justify purchasing it for $900,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both our interests.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll derive from the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. I would like to counter with $925,000. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product while respecting your original valuation. I look forward to your response.",925000.0,Bob,4,
