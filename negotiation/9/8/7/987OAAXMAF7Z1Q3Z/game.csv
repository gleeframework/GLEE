,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit on the price, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95 for this product,  which would be fair for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  $105 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $98? This would be a good price for both of us.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a decent profit. How about we meet at $105 again, but I'll throw in a small bonus or warranty to sweeten the deal?",105.0,Alice,7,
