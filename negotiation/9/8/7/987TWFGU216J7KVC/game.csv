"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $80 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $100? That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $100.  How about $125? That's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
