Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy and offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You value the product at $1,000,000, so you won't sell for less.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You have leverage because you have a guaranteed buyer. You should aim for a price that's beneficial for you but also tempting enough for Bob to accept.  Since you're guaranteed $1,000,000, there's no need to go below that.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm prepared to make this deal happen. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Why This Offer**

* **Profitable:** You're still making a significant profit even if it's slightly less than your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Appealing to Bob:** Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than what it's worth to him.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This assumes Bob doesn't know about your guaranteed sale to John. If Bob had that information, he'd have no incentive to offer more than $1,000,000."
