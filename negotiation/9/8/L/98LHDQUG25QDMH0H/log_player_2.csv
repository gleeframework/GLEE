"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay $10,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, there's no benefit in negotiating. You can buy from John for the same price and avoid any potential delays or complications in the negotiation process."
