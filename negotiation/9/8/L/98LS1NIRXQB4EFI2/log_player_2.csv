(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $2,000,000 is over his budget, and there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Bob should start with a significantly lower counteroffer to see Alice's reaction.  $1,000,000 is a bold move but it's a good starting point to gauge Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his desired price. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

Bob should increase his offer to $1,250,000. This shows he's serious about buying the product but is still trying to stay within his budget. It's a reasonable middle ground to see if Alice will budge."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's very close to his budget, but he can still try to push for a lower price. John is a guaranteed option at $1,500,000, so there's no need to rush into this deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

Bob should increase his offer again to $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from his previous offer, showing he's willing to come closer to Alice's price. However, it's still below John's price, giving him some negotiating room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  It's within his budget and a better deal than John's price. He's also only got a few rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will drop her price much further."
