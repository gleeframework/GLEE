"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I believe this initial offer is ambitious, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm rejecting it and will make a counteroffer in the next round.  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,750,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation and is closer to my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair compromise that could be attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though it's a step in the right direction.  I'm not ready to accept this offer, and I'm willing to risk losing a few rounds to get closer to my desired price.  I'm still hoping to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safety net, but I believe I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,600,000.  This is another step down, but I'm still trying to hold out for a higher price.  We're getting closer to an agreement, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still holding out for a little more.  It's risky to keep rejecting his offers, but I think I can get closer to my target price. Selling to John is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,450,000. We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and this is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I believe this is a fair price that could finally lead to an agreement."
