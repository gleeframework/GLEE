"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth your while. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my asking price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $105. How about we meet at $95? I'm willing to make a serious offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $95 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $100. How about we meet at $92? I think this is a reasonable compromise.",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $92 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $98. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal, what do you say?",98.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a fair profit, but $98 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet at $96? I think this is a reasonable compromise.",96.0,Bob,8,
