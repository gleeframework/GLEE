"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me.  This is a fair price considering its potential. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,750,000 is still above my budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This would be a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. However, the product's value is substantial, and $1,100,000 remains too low. I'm willing to consider $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute limit.  If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to go with John's offer.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
