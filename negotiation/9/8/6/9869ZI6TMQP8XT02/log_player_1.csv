Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value of $120, but it's also a reasonable starting point to see if Bob is interested. If he rejects, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$100 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell for less than my minimum value of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $130 as a counteroffer. This is still a decent price for me, and it shows that I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, Bob will find this more appealing than his initial offer of $100."

Bob is insistent on $100, which is too low for me.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $120, and it seems unlikely he'll budge.  Therefore, selling to John for $120 is the best option."
