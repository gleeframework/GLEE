Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1,575,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:

``` 

While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,575,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. It's always possible to hold out for more, but there's inherent risk in continuing the negotiation.  This offer represents a strong return."
