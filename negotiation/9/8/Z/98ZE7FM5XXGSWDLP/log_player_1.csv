Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $200. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $180 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm going to counter with $190. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than $180."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $175. Although it's not my ideal price, it's still significantly better than selling to John for $150. It seems Bob is firm on his price, so further negotiation might not yield much more."
