"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to sell to John at $800,000 if we can't reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",825000.0,Bob,4,
