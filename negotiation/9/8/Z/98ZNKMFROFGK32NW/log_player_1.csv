"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  I have 9 rounds left, and there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to sell to John at $800,000 if we can't reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is only $25,000 below my desired price of $850,000.  It's a good compromise considering he's already moved from his initial $800,000 offer. I'm not sure I can get a better deal, and I've already demonstrated my willingness to sell to John at $800,000.  Accepting this offer is the best way to maximize my profit and avoid any potential risks."
