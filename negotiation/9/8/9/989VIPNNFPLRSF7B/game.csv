"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  $12,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $14,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm eager to make this deal work.",14500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $14,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $13,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $13,500? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
