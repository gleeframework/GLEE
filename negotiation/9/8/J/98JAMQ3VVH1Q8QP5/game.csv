"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $750000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My revised offer is $850000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,
