"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with an aggressive price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $950,000 is significantly less than my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I need to see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  It's a compromise from my initial offer, but I'm confident that Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly my minimum value. I'm happy to accept this offer as it's a fair deal and ensures I don't lose out on potential profits.  It's also a good outcome given the limited rounds available."
