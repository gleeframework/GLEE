"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $120. This is a great deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $120 is within your budget, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. Rejecting her initial offer opens the door for negotiation. You can always buy from John for $150 if needed."
