{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price, and there's only one round left.  It's unlikely that Alice will go lower than $1,000,000, and even then, Bob would be better off buying from John.  Buying from John guarantees the product at a price Bob is comfortable with, and he avoids the risk of Alice rejecting his final counteroffer."
