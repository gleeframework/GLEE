"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $85, my final offer.  This is a great price for a product you'll love. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85, and your goal is to get the best possible price. John offers a sure deal at $80, which meets your budget."
