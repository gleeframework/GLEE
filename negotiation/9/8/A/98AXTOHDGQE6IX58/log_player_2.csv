"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer.  It's likely Alice will accept a price closer to her value of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $12,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and closer to Bob's desired price range. Accepting the offer is the most financially sensible choice."
