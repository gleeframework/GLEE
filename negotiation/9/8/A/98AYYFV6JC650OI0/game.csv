"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the value, but $900,000 is quite a bit lower than what I can consider. To find a middle ground, how about we settle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make a more substantial reduction. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
