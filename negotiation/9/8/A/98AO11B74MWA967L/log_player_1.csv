Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum and even below John's standing offer.  It's time to walk away.
