"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about $110? That's a fair compromise, I think.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's meet in the middle, I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. Would you be willing to go down to $107? I'm really close to walking away, but I love the product and want to make a deal work.",107.0,Bob,6,
