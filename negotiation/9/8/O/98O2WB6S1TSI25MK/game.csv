"Alice, thanks for the offer but $2,300,000 is way above my budget. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $2,300,000 represents its full potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects a significant investment from my side and still provides you with considerable value.  What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
