Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  $8,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counter-offering at $17,000.  This is still a decent profit for me, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to lower my price to $16,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still confident that I can get a good price for the product.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair offer and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and we haven't been able to reach an agreement. His offers have been consistently lower than what I'm willing to accept. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to keep haggling and risk losing a sale. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  This is my minimum acceptable price, and it ensures that I don't lose out on a potential sale."
