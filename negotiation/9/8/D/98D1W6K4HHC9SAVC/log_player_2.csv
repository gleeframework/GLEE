"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm starting with an offer of $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is significantly lower than my maximum price of $150.  There's room for negotiation.  I'll reject and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is still within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to my maximum price of $150. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still keeping me within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $105. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is getting closer to my desired price range, but I believe there's still room to negotiate further. I'm going to reject the offer and try to bring her down even closer to my $120 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on $120, as that's what fits my budget. I think it's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer of $120. This shows Alice that I'm serious about that price and am willing to stand firm. It also sets the stage for a potential agreement in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $120. I'm willing to offer $110, which is closer to your target price. I think it's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is a good compromise.  It's closer to my target price of $120, and while I'd prefer to get it for even less, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer saves me $40 compared to buying from John."
