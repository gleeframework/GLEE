"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm starting with an offer of $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is still within my budget.  What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $105. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on $120, as that's what fits my budget. I think it's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at that price.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $120. I'm willing to offer $110, which is closer to your target price. I think it's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",110.0,Alice,5,
