"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1500000. It's a steal considering its true value. I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds for your business. Let me know what you think!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000. This is a fair price considering I can easily purchase it elsewhere for $1000000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1100000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1300000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a great opportunity. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is a fair price considering the market value and my ability to purchase elsewhere. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept it.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
