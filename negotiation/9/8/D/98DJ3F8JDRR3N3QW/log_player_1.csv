"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000. This is a fair price considering I can easily purchase it elsewhere for $1000000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is a fair price considering the market value and my ability to purchase elsewhere. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept it.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 meets my minimum acceptable value.  While I could potentially try to negotiate a higher price, there's no guarantee of success, and I risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum desired price and close the deal."
