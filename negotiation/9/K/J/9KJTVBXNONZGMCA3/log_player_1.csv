"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that sets the bar high, but still allows for some negotiation room.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how he responds before potentially moving to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is still a good amount, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for further discussion.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob before potentially switching to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $850,000 is a good price and I'm getting close to my minimum value.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing too hard and having Bob walk away."
