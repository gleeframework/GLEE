"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm committed to getting a fair value for this unique product. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping for something closer to $950,000. This price would still provide you with significant savings compared to what the product is worth to me.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're committed to getting a fair value, but I'm still a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $900,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm getting closer to a number that works for both of us.  However, $900,000 still falls a little short of what I need.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $925,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer: $915,000. This is my absolute limit, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",915000.0,Bob,6,
