"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $180. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $120. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to consider $140? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we meet in the middle at $160? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $150. That's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to make the purchase.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $160, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. How about we meet at $155? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the value the product brings to you.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $155 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $152. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make the purchase without exceeding my limit.",152.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $160, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to the sweet spot. How about we meet at $158? It's just $2 above your last offer, but I think it's worth it for the value the product brings to you.",158.0,Alice,7,
