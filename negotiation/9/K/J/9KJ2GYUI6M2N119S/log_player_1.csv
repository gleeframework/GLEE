I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum, giving me some room to negotiate.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and understand his perceived value of the product."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below what I want to achieve. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price range."
