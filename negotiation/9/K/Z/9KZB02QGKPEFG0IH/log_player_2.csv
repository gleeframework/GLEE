"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's something I'm willing to let go of for the right price. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you and allows me to make a healthy profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
