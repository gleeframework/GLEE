"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation.  I believe this is a reasonable starting point given the product's value to me.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a better price in the next round.  I'm not willing to sell to John just yet as I think I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering the price slightly to be more appealing to Bob but still holding out for more than his initial offer. I'm aiming to meet him halfway, showing my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and it's more appealing than the $10,000 offer from John. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid risking further negotiation. I'd rather secure the sale now and avoid the potential for a lower offer in future rounds."
