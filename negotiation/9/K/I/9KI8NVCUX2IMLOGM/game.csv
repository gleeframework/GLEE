"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
