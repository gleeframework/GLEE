"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $15000? I think that's a fair price considering my budget.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16500.  This is still a great price for the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $16500.  How about $16000? I really want this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,4,
