"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're excited about the product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $75?  It's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $82? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $82 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle on $80, the same price as John is offering. It would be a fair deal for both of us and I can purchase the product immediately.",80.0,Bob,4,
