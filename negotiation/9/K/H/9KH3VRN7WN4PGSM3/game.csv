"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, your price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the market conditions.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time.  I'm comfortable offering $950,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $950,000, which would be $1,025,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
