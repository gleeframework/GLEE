Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,100,000 before exploring other options.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a significant profit margin for me while still offering Bob a price that's well below his perceived value ($800,000). This makes it a tempting offer for him.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a time constraint encourages Bob to act quickly and prevents him from overthinking or trying to negotiate further."
