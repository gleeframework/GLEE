"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,500?  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,250. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Bob,4,
