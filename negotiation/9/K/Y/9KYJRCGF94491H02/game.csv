,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $1,200,000. Can we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to show good faith. This still reflects the value of the product to you. Let's work towards a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be able to make a profit on this deal. Can we talk about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but that's really my absolute lowest.  This product is extremely valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll be able to generate a substantial return on your investment. Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $975,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. Can we talk about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
