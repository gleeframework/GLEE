Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Bob's offer:

This represents a fair price for both of us - it's significantly closer to your asking price than my initial offer, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
