,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $115, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $115 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  I'm confident we can both walk away happy with that deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can do $112.50, which is the best I can do. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,5,
