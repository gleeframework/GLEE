Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is certainly interesting, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, considering my budget and the market value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your perspective, the value of this product is substantial, and $1,200,000 undervalues its potential significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,750,000?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and it's the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a better outcome than further risky negotiations with Bob."
