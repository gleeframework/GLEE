Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($150) but still lower than what I know John is willing to pay. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The price isn't too high that it immediately discourages Bob. There's still room for him to counteroffer, which allows for a more engaging negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** Starting with a friendly message helps to build rapport, which can be beneficial in a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Selling to John is not ideal:** While selling to John for $150 is guaranteed, it's still less than I might be able to get from Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a good deal for both of us, as I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering within a reasonable range:**  $140 is a compromise,  a significant step down from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** I highlight that this price is a ""good deal for both of us"", making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I continue to be friendly and encouraging, hoping to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too expensive. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $135 is only $15 below my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good compromise that balances the need to earn as much as possible while still closing the deal.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to further price reductions, potentially bringing me closer to my minimum or even below it.
* **Time is a factor:**  While selling to John for $150 is guaranteed, it's uncertain how long it might take to finalize that sale. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal now."
