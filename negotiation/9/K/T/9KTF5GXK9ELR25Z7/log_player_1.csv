Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a strong offer that leans towards your ideal outcome.  Even if Bob doesn't accept $1,300,000, it sets a high anchor point for further discussion.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is significantly above what Bob values the product at ($800,000), but there's still room for negotiation.
* **Below Your Guaranteed Price:** The offer ensures you make a profit even if Bob rejects it, as you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone of the message is polite and invites Bob to share his thoughts, leaving room for potential counter-offers. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
