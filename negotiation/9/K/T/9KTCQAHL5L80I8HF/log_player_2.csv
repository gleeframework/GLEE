"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Alice's offer is the same as John's offer, you are indifferent between the two.  It doesn't matter which you choose, as you will pay the same amount either way.  However, since the question asks you to ""save as much money as you can"" and both offers are the same, the optimal choice is to accept Alice's offer."
