Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is well above your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $1,200,000 is significantly less than the $1,500,000 value Bob places on the product, giving him a strong incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This offer sets the stage for a negotiation, giving you the ability to potentially reach a higher price. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is still a decent profit, it's significantly less than your initial offer.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This counteroffer is a good strategy because:

* **It's a compromise:** You've moved closer to Bob's offer, showing your willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  $1,000,000 is still more than your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you still profit.
* **It leaves room for final negotiation:** You're still $100,000 away from Bob's offer, leaving room for a final negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **You're close to your goal:** $950,000 is a significant profit and is very close to your initial target of $1,000,000.
* **Bob's offer is final:**  He's stated this is his final offer, meaning further negotiation might lead to a stalemate.
* **Selling to John would be less profitable:**  Selling to John for $800,000 would be a lower profit than accepting Bob's offer.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
