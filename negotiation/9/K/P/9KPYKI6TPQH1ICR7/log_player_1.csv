Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation and a potential compromise.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  By starting high, I aim to secure a price closer to my desired $15,000. 
* **Keep negotiations open:** Leaving room for negotiation allows for potential compromises and a higher chance of a deal.
* **Maintain the John option:** The knowledge that I can sell to John for $15,000 provides a strong bargaining position. I can always end the negotiation with Bob and go with John if the deal isn't favorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I want to make a deal, accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a sale and will only accept a fair price.
* **Continue negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a more acceptable price.
* **Preserve the John option:** The ability to sell to John for $15,000 gives me the flexibility to walk away if the negotiation with Bob doesn't produce a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $12,500, which is halfway between my original offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I'm remaining polite and reaffirming the product's value. I'm also emphasizing that this is a ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find middle ground:** I'm aiming for a price that's acceptable to both of us.
* **Signal willingness to compromise:**  By meeting Bob halfway, I'm showing that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Avoid the John option (for now):**  I'm still hoping to reach an agreement with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value, Alice, but I have a pretty firm budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,250 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value.  At this point, the negotiation is getting to be a bit of a stalemate.  

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer:

* **I secure a deal:** I avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal with Bob altogether.
* **I mitigate the loss:** While $11,250 is less than my ideal, it's still a decent profit and far better than selling to John for $15,000.

**Important Note:**  It's a close call, but I'm leaning towards accepting the offer because the potential for further negotiation with Bob seems limited. It's also important to consider the time and energy involved in continuing the negotiation."
