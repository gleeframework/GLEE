``` 

This offer gives me a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  It also highlights the value Bob will get from buying the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. How about $10,000?  I'm serious about buying this, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my initial offer. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but still above Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget concerns.  I can do $11,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
