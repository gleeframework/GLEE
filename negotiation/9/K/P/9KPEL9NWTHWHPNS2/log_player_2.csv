# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget concerns.  I can do $11,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
