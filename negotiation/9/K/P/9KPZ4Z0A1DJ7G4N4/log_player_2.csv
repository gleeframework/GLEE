# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** By rejecting the offer, Bob can initiate a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Alice's minimum acceptable value.

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob retains the ability to potentially get a better price without losing out on the product entirely."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above Alice's minimum acceptable value of $8,000.  This shows that Bob is serious about negotiating but also leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message emphasizes Bob's willingness to negotiate while subtly reminding Alice of the product's value to her.  This can help encourage Alice to consider a lower price."
