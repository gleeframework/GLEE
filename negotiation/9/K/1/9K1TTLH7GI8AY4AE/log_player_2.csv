"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not budging much, and her counteroffer is very close to what you'd pay John. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are minimal, and the risk of a stalemate or prolonged negotiation is high. It's more efficient and less risky to simply buy the product from John for $1,000,000, securing the product without further delay or potential complications."
