"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. Let's aim for a price closer to $950,000. I believe this would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
