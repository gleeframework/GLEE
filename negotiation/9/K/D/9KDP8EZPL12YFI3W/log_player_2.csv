{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.**  You're willing to pay $120, and her offer is $110. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **It's too early to buy from John.**  You haven't explored all your options with Alice yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  $105 is halfway between Alice's offer and your maximum budget.
* **Show willingness to compromise:**  This indicates you're serious about buying the product.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  There's still space to adjust the price if Alice isn't happy with your initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a price that's closer to the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle at 112.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget.** You're aiming for a price of $120 or lower, and her offer is $112.50.
* **You have room for negotiation.**  While her offer is closer to your desired price, there's still potential to get it lower.
* **It's too early to buy from John.** You've only had a few rounds, and there's a chance Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's split the difference and make a deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain your position:**  You're sticking to your goal of staying below $120.
* **Show flexibility:** You're willing to compromise a little bit, but you're still driving for a better price.
* **Frame it as a win-win:**  Suggesting a compromise makes it seem like a fair solution for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at 111? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  You're willing to pay up to $120, and her offer is $111.
* **The deal is close.** You've already negotiated a significant discount from her initial price.
* **There's a risk of losing the deal.** If you reject this offer, Alice might not be willing to negotiate further, and you might end up paying more to John. 

While it's a bit above your ideal price, accepting this offer ensures you get the product and avoid the potential of paying more to John."
