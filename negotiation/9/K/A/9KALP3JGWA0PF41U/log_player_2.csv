"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While it's in your budget, paying $1,100,000 is not ideal. 
* You know John will sell it for $1,200,000. Rejecting Alice's offer might push her to lower the price closer to her own valuation of $1,000,000.  

**Strategy:**

By rejecting the offer, you're aiming to get Alice to propose a better deal, ideally closer to or even below $1,000,000. You always have John's offer as a fallback."
