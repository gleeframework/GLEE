"Hi Alice,  $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $110. Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $125 is still a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's the absolute maximum I can afford.",120.0,Bob,4,
