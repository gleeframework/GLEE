{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's above your minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is a good offer, it's still lower than my ideal price. I'm going to try and see if I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I let it go for $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,250 is close enough to my desired price point. While I'd love to get closer to $9,500, the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower offer or Bob backing out entirely makes this offer a good deal."
