"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $150 either. How about we meet in the middle at $165? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $165 is still a little too high for me. I'm really set on $150. If you can't do that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",150.0,Bob,4,
