Alice's offer:

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget and more than he's willing to pay. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. At this point, it's better for Bob to go with John, who is selling the product for his desired price.  Further negotiation with Alice risks her walking away completely."
