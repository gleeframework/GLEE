"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500?  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this deal happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,250? I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway.  However,  $10,250 still isn't quite where I need to be. How about we split the difference at $10,375? That's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",10375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, but $10,375 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower, how about $10,200? I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",10200.0,Bob,6,
