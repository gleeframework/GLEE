"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $180 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $120. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $160, which is still a good deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $160 is still a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? That's a good price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit lower than my target price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $145, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
