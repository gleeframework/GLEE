Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefit it will bring to your operations."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000. Offering it slightly below this at $1,400,000 maximizes your potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain. 
* **Strong Opening:** This offer sets a strong starting point for the negotiation. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle, but ensures you're aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price, allowing you to be firm in your negotiation with Bob."
