"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. While $800000 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to drop the price to $1200000. This would allow me to secure a fair return while hopefully still being within your budget.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate you sticking with this negotiation.  While $900000 is still a bit below what I need, I'm willing to make one final compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1050000. This would allow me to move forward while hopefully remaining within your budget.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
