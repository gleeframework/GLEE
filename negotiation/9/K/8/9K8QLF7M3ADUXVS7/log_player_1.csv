I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this will be attractive to Bob while also ensuring I make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I will counteroffer and try to push the price a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $95.  It's a compromise that's still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his desired price. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92

Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my desired price and is higher than what I could get from John.  It's time to accept and finalize the deal."
