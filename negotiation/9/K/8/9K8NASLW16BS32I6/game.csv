"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but  $7,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $7,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,250. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",7250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a little hesitant at $7,250.  Would you consider $7,100? That's a fair compromise, and it's closer to my budget.",7100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,250 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $7,150. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7150.0,Alice,5,
