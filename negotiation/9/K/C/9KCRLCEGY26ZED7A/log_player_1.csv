Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is greater than your minimum of $8,000, meaning you'll still make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a $2,000 gap between your offer and Bob's potential value, allowing for some back and forth.
* **It's a strong opening:**  Starting with a higher price gives you more bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin.  Rejecting his offer gives me a chance to counter and potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth it. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
