Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position, and it allows room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 
I'm offering Bob $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is close enough to my desired price that it's worth accepting.  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I would be left with only John's offer of $800,000.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that is significantly higher than John's offer."
