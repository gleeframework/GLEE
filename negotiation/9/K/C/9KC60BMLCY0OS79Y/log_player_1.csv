Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This offer gives me a good chance of getting a better price than John's $15,000 while still being attractive to Bob. 

Here's why:

* **Value to Bob:** $10,000 
* **My offer:** $12,000 
* **Value to John:** $15,000

Bob is likely to accept this offer because he can get the product for $2,000 less than his perceived value.  At the same time, I earn $2,000 more than I would from selling to John."
