This offer is a starting point.  It's a bit higher than what I know it's worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially a good deal for both of us. I'm also being friendly and optimistic, which might help to keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider a price of $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is still a decent amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $800,000 I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can bridge the gap."
