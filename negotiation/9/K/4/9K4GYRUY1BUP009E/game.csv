"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $110 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $100 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm really hoping to stay under $90.  Would you be willing to consider $90 for the product?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay under $90, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $95, which is a great compromise. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
