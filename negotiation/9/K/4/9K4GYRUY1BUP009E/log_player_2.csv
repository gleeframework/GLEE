"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible, and $110 is still more than you're willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $110 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still trying to save as much money as possible. While $100 is closer to your target, it's still higher than you want to pay.  Rejecting allows you to counteroffer again and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $100 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm really hoping to stay under $90.  Would you be willing to consider $90 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay under $90, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $95, which is a great compromise. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You've reached a point where the negotiation isn't getting you closer to your desired price quickly enough.  Alice is willing to go down to $95, but you're only willing to pay $90.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $80, it's the best choice to avoid further negotiation and secure the product for the lowest price."
