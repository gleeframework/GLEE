"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,750,000. This price reflects the unique benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. You should negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,200,000?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for negotiation. This approach tests Alice's flexibility and establishes your serious interest in a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,200,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's not quite where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down in price, but her offer is still above John's price. You have leverage, as you can always buy from John.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a better deal."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable, but $1,550,000 is still a touch high for me.  How about we settle at $1,350,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We are moving closer to Alice's adjusted price but still aiming for a significant saving. This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while holding a firm position below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and I'm glad we're getting closer.  While $1,350,000 is a good step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to John's price, but there's still room for negotiation. Since you're below your maximum budget, you have a little leverage to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I respect your position. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. This is my final offer, as it's the best I can do while still feeling good about the deal."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We are now getting very close to John's price, and it's time to signal firmness.  By stating this is your final offer, you add weight to the negotiation and increase the chances of Alice accepting. If she rejects this, you can always buy from John, minimizing your potential loss."
