"Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,750,000. This price reflects the unique benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,200,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's not quite where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable, but $1,550,000 is still a touch high for me.  How about we settle at $1,350,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and I'm glad we're getting closer.  While $1,350,000 is a good step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I respect your position. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. This is my final offer, as it's the best I can do while still feeling good about the deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
