"Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I can only offer $9,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's still a great price for you, and a fair deal for me.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to go a little higher, but $10,500 is still too much for me. Let's try $10,200.  I think this is a fair compromise for both of us.",10200.0,Bob,4,
