Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
The product is worth at least $80 to me. Bob's offer of $70 is too low, I'll reject and try to get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $85 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $75, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I've already rejected him once. There's a risk of a continued downward spiral in negotiations. It's better to secure the $80 from John and avoid further risk."
