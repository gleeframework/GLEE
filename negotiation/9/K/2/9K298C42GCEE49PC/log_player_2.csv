"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's not worth accepting at this point. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product's potential, $22,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my budget, $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm not willing to pay more than $10,000, so I'll reject her offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still above my budget.  As I said, $10,000 is the maximum I can pay. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I'm getting. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to be closer to the product's actual worth. Let's try $16,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not willing to budge much further on her price. While $16,000 is closer to my budget than her previous offers, it's still too high for me. I've already made my position clear and she's not budging.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  At least I know I can get the product for a price that fits my budget."
