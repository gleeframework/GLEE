"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product's potential, $22,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still above my budget.  As I said, $10,000 is the maximum I can pay. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I'm getting. Let's try to close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to be closer to the product's actual worth. Let's try $16,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.",16000.0,Alice,5,
