"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $950,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, however, the  $750,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $900,000? This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budgetary constraints. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After careful consideration, I am still unable to meet the $900,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I hope this offers a compromise that is acceptable to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
