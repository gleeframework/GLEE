This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is below your maximum budget, you can do better. You have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you leave open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or ultimately going with John's offer."
