"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, my budget doesn't allow me to go above $800,000 at this time. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price within that range. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider selling the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to budge much further.  At $950,000, the price is still outside of my budget and I'm not comfortable going any higher.  While there might be potential for further negotiation, the risk of going back and forth with Alice and potentially going over my budget is too high.  It's better to lock in the guaranteed $800,000 price with John and avoid the risk."
