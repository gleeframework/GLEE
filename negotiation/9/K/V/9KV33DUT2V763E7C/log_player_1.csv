Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and acknowledges Bob's potential higher value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a bit low, but it's still a good starting point for the next round. I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is still less than my initial offer, but it's a reasonable compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
