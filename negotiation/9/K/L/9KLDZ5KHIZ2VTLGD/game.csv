"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable considering the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for countering.  I understand your position and that this product holds significant value. To be frank, $1,000,000 is a little too high for my budget. I can go up to $700,000. I think this reflects a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.
