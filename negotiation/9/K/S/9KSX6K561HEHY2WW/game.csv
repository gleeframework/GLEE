"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering my needs and the product's market value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 represents its true value, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering both our needs. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
