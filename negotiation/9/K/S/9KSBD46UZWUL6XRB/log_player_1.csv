"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and potential return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than even my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives Bob the impression that the product is highly valuable. 
* **Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a number, I'm framing it with ""value proposition"" and ""potential return on investment"" to anchor the price in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I want to maximize profit, I also need to be mindful of Bob's potential counteroffers.  If negotiations stall too low, I have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $2,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I have room to negotiate and eight rounds remaining. I'll aim to bring him closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, however, the value of this product is truly unique.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:**  I'm significantly decreasing my price from $2,200,000 to $1,900,000 to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Holding Firm:**  While I'm flexible, I'm not drastically dropping the price. I'm staying above the $1,500,000 mark (John's offer) to ensure I have room for further negotiation and maximize my potential profit.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm continuing to emphasize the product's value and using language like ""middle ground"" to make the negotiation collaborative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met my absolute minimum acceptable price, which is the same amount John is offering. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away. Accepting now guarantees I make my minimum and avoids potentially losing out on both buyers."
