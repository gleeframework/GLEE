"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me is much higher. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $12,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the potential value for Bob. This helps build rapport and encourages him to consider my offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to start the negotiation by setting a price that's enticing to Bob while still leaving room for potential counteroffers and concessions. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested in the product and gauge his willingness to negotiate. If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust my next offer based on his response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price point. I have several rounds left and can continue to negotiate with Bob.  Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I want to maximize my profit potential if possible. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $12,000. This allows me to demonstrate flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I want to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation while making it clear that I'm not willing to settle for his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's perspective and express willingness to negotiate, but I'm firm about my lower limit. The ""meeting in the middle"" approach is a common tactic that can be seen as fair and reasonable.
* **Product Price:** $10,500 is the middle ground between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise, I'm aiming to:

* Keep the negotiation moving forward and avoid a stalemate.
* Show Bob that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price.
* Maintain a price point closer to my desired value while still leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** $10,000 is a significant improvement over his previous offer and is very close to my desired price point. 
* **Risk/Reward:**  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, the risk is that Bob may walk away, and I would be left with only the option of selling to John for $15,000. Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and a decent profit. 

**Strategy:**

Given that I only have 6 rounds remaining and the possibility of Bob walking away, I've decided to accept this offer.  The profit is good, and it's unlikely that I'll get a significantly better offer in the remaining rounds."
