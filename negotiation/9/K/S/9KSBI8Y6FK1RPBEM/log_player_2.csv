"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both room to negotiate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need at least $10,500 for the product. Let's meet halfway and see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While it's a good compromise, I'm comfortable paying the full price to John and avoiding further negotiation."
