"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique qualities, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is simply out of my budget.  I'm very interested in the product but need to stay within my $1,000,000 limit. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This shows a genuine interest and is a starting point for further negotiation.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm committed to acquiring this product but need to stay close to my $1,000,000 limit. Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This shows a genuine desire to close the deal, and it's a fair price considering the value I place on this product.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
