Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is simply out of my budget.  I'm very interested in the product but need to stay within my $1,000,000 limit. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This shows a genuine interest and is a starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm committed to acquiring this product but need to stay close to my $1,000,000 limit. Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This shows a genuine desire to close the deal, and it's a fair price considering the value I place on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
