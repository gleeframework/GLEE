"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price by negotiating. You have a clear goal of $100 as your maximum, and there are rounds to spare.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's a bit lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the range I'm willing to pay. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm also being realistic about what I think is fair. I'll adjust my offers based on Alice's responses, but this is a good starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my goal of $100, I still believe I can get a better deal. I have 7 more rounds to negotiate, and I'm not willing to give up yet.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still keeping it below my maximum of $100. This is a strategic move to gauge Alice's willingness to meet me halfway and potentially close the deal in the upcoming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is close to my maximum, I still have 5 rounds left and I'm not willing to give up on getting a better deal.  I'm confident I can get a lower price by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue pushing for a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but still staying below my maximum of $100.  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so I'm pushing the boundaries a bit further. I'm also factoring in that we're nearing the midpoint of the negotiation rounds, so there's a need to start closing in on a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is my maximum limit, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds and ending up with a worse deal. There's a chance she might reject my counteroffer again, and I'd be left with only 3 rounds. It's more prudent to accept John's offer for $100, which guarantees me the product within my budget and with no risk of losing the opportunity."
