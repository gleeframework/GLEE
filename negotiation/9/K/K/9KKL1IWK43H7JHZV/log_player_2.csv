"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John for the same price guarantees you get the product without any potential risk of a failed negotiation."
