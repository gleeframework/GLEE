"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible while leaving room for negotiation.  This also shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my desired price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counter-offering with $130. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintaining a price that is closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired value.  At this point, I'm willing to accept and finalize the deal with Bob to avoid risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's lower offer."
