"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price, significantly more than Bob's perceived value, but still less than my minimum. This is a strategic move to test the waters and gauge Bob's interest. There's a chance he might be willing to pay more than expected, especially if he sees the product as valuable. If he rejects, we have room to negotiate downwards in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm confident that I can push for a better deal, especially since I have several rounds remaining. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,550,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal. However, it's still above my minimum and closer to my ideal price point. This counteroffer is a good compromise, and it increases the chances of Bob accepting."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my ideal price.  I have multiple rounds left and there's a good chance I can secure a better deal. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the leverage to push for a higher price in the next round. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, which is a solid backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm further lowering my price to $1,400,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and incentivizes Bob to counter with a higher offer. It's still a good profit for me, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward.  It's a strategic move to find a middle ground and increase the chances of a deal in the remaining rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is nearing my minimum, it's still not ideal. I have several rounds left, and I believe I can secure a better price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and attempt to push for a higher price. 

I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $1,500,000, which remains a strong backup plan."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're now down to the final two rounds and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  While I could try to counter again, there's a good chance he won't budge. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees I meet my minimum and ensures a profitable outcome.  I'm choosing to secure this guaranteed deal instead of risking a failed negotiation with Bob."
