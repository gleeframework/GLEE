"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth $175.  Would you be interested in purchasing it at that price?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit. However, I'm also conscious of Bob's potential value for the product.  We'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price considering the value of this item. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm sticking to my minimum price point for now, but I'm using a friendly and open tone to encourage further discussion.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $130 is still not enough. I'll counter with a lower price, but I'm still keeping in mind my minimum threshold. I want to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $140?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at that price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit more, demonstrating flexibility. However, I'm also highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing that $140 is still a fair price. This is a strategic move to try and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go any higher than $135. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $135 is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, but if Bob remains firm, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $135 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $145.  This is my final offer - what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm also signaling that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $145 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $137.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only three rounds left, it's unlikely that Bob will go much higher, and $137.50 is still below my minimum.  I'm confident that selling to John will secure me a better price and avoid further negotiation."
