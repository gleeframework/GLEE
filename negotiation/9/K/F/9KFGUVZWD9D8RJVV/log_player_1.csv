"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to maximize my potential profit.
* **Appealing to Bob's interest:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, highlighting the potential savings. This can make him more receptive to the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to communicate his thoughts, suggesting I'm willing to negotiate further.

**Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's demonstrated a willingness to negotiate. I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is the fallback:** If I can't get a better price from Bob, selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than his offer. This will show him that I am willing to negotiate but not give away the product for a low price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 for the product. This price is still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial $12,000, demonstrating a willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Maintain Profit:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Incentivize Bob:** I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal"" for both of us, appealing to his sense of fairness and potentially encouraging him to accept. 
* **Open to Further Discussion:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation by asking, ""What do you say?"". This keeps the conversation going and allows for potential adjustments if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,750 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $9,750 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Further negotiation is likely:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and is getting closer to my desired price. I believe I can get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 at any time. This gives me a safety net if I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still higher than his offer. I will try to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,000 for the product? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm demonstrating a commitment to finding a solution by offering to meet Bob halfway once more. This shows I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $10,000 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Appeal to fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Open to a deal:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts, keeping the door open for potential adjustments if needed.

**Note:** This is a crucial point in the negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will need to seriously consider selling to John to avoid a further decrease in my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, Alice! I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. How about $9,900 for the product? This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's a slight improvement, $9,900 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Selling to John is the best option:** With only four rounds left, I don't have time for further negotiations.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit and avoids the risk of accepting an offer that is too low. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John eliminates the possibility of further negotiations that could lead to a lower price. 

I'm choosing to sell to John because it's the most secure and profitable option at this stage."
