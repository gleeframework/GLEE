"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high with $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate and see if Bob is truly interested. I'm also leaving some room to potentially drop the price in future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm going to try to get a better deal. Bob is clearly willing to pay at least $15,000, so I can potentially get a higher price.  I'll see what counteroffer I can get from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it gives me some room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is better than my minimum of $15,000 and it's getting closer to my desired price.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal.  There's always a chance I could get a bit more, but I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
