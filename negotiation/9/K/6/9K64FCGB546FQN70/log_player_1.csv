Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000** is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and increase the chances of a successful deal. 
* I'm also emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to consider my offer.

This initial offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation and allows me to assess Bob's interest in the product and his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle for the lowest possible price right away. By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Show that I'm not desperate:** This could make Bob more likely to increase his offer.
* **Maintain leverage:** I can use the counteroffer stage to potentially get a price closer to my desired $15,000.
* **Gather more information:** Observing Bob's willingness to negotiate will give me a better understanding of his budget and potential to increase the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500 to make this deal work.  It's still a great price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let me know if you're able to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with a compromise:**  Instead of simply rejecting Bob, I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to his price but still higher than my absolute minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider the offer as a good deal.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging to maintain a good rapport and increase the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a significant improvement from his initial offer of $12,000. It's also only $500 less than my counteroffer of $13,500.  Considering that:

* **I'm nearing my minimum acceptable price:**  Accepting this offer means I'll make a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiations.
* **There's a risk of Bob walking away:**  If I reject this offer, he might decide to walk away altogether, leaving me with only the $12,000 option from John.

It's a calculated risk, but accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option to secure a decent profit and avoid potential losses."
