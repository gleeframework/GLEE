"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I will reject Bob's offer. Although I'm motivated to sell, $7,500 is below my minimum threshold.  I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. While I'd prefer to get more, Bob is getting closer to my minimum threshold, but I'm not confident he'll agree to a higher price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and allows me to avoid further negotiation with Bob."
