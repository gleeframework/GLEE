Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable investment. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is better than our fallback option (selling to John), but it's still significantly below our target price. We have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  To be frank, $1,200,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. I believe this price point reflects the true value you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting closer, but $1,350,000 is still below our aspiration.  We'll counter-offer again to see if we can push a bit higher.  We're past the halfway point in the rounds, so there's some urgency to getting closer to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to a deal, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is clearly trying to anchor the price lower, dropping his increments. We're getting close to the point where the potential gains from further negotiation might not outweigh the risk of losing the sale. However, we still have a few rounds left to try and secure a slightly better price.  We'll hold firm for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,320,000 is cutting a little too close.  To be fair to both of us, I propose a final offer of $1,350,000.  This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.  Let's get this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

We're getting close to the wire. In this round, we're making a firm but fair final offer, splitting the difference on his last counter while reiterating the product's value.  This signals our serious intent to close the deal and puts the decision squarely in Bob's court."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,330,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  

While we'd ideally like to hold out for more, Bob is incrementally decreasing his offers, indicating reluctance to move substantially higher. Accepting his offer of $1,330,000 secures a profit above our guaranteed sale to John and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in the final rounds."
