"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $9500? That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10500, which is closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is a bit closer to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $10500, which would be $10750. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,
