"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify paying $900,000.  Would that work for you?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,000,000? That's a fair price that considers both our positions.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I can sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
