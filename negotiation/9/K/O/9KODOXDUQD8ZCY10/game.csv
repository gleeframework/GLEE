"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for this product. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart. While I appreciate the product's value, I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $700,000 for it?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $700,000 is still too low. How about we meet halfway at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  To be honest,  $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to settle at $800,000?  That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
