"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $22,000 is quite high. I'm interested, but only if it's within a more reasonable range. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it offers.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I'm sensing we're getting closer to a number we can both agree on. Would you consider $15,500? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value.",15500.0,Alice,5,
