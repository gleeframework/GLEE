"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, my budget allows me to spend up to $1500000. I would like to propose a price of $1200000 to reflect this. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1200000 is a significant offer, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for me. I'm confident that this is a fair and mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am unable to meet the price of $1700000. I would like to propose a price of $1400000. I hope this aligns better with our mutual interests.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
