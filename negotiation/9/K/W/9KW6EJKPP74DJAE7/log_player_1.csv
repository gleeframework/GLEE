"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really benefit from it. I'm offering it to you for $17,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but still lower than my minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a starting point for bargaining.
* **Positive Message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive light, emphasizing the benefits for Bob. This helps establish a friendly tone for the negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies flexibility and a willingness to discuss the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is a step closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a better price. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees my minimum profit, but I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting closer to my ideal price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we split the difference at $14,500?  I believe that's a fair price considering the value this product will bring you."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not completely shutting the door. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** This shows I'm willing to compromise and meet him halfway, making the counter-offer seem reasonable. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to strengthen my position. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $14,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum at this point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum profit, but I'm still hopeful of getting a better price with Bob.  The risk of continuing is outweighed by the potential reward of a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $14,000.  This is a significant discount from my original asking price and a fair reflection of our negotiation.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but I'm not going below my minimum yet.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a great deal for him, considering the value of the product.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and persuasive tone to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Finality:**  I'm subtly suggesting that this may be my final offer, to encourage a quicker decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $14,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob is getting closer, $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Potential:**  We've gone through several rounds, and it seems like Bob is unwilling to go any higher. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially ending up with a lower price than I could get from John. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable profit. 

At this point, the potential gain from continuing the negotiation with Bob doesn't outweigh the risk of losing time and potentially getting a worse price. It's best to secure the guaranteed profit from John."
