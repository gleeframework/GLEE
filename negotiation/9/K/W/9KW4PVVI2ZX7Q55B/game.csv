"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would represent a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
