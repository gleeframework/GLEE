# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget.  It makes sense to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly over my budget. I'm interested in this product but I can only offer $600,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600000 is simply too low for this product.  I understand your budget constraints, but this is a unique opportunity you won't find elsewhere. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $850000.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay, but it's getting closer. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $775,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $825000? This would be a fair compromise, and it would allow both of us to benefit from this unique opportunity.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price, as you are still within your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $795,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us and would allow us to close this deal quickly. Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 795000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and see we're getting closer. However, $795000 is still just a bit short of what I need to accept.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more, how about $805000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing us to close this deal quickly and efficiently.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $805,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $805,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $805,000 is still outside of your preferred budget.  While you are willing to negotiate, the risk of further counteroffers not being accepted is increasing.  It's more prudent to buy from John at $800,000 to ensure you secure the product within your budget."
