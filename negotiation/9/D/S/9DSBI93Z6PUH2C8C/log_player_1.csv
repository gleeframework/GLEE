Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate it.  However, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not able to go that high though.  How about $9,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it's the absolute most I can do.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a certain price, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  My absolute maximum is $8,000, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.  Is there any chance you would consider that?

It's clear that Bob is anchored at $8,000 and is unlikely to budge significantly.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
