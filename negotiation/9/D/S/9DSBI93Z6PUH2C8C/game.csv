"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly useful for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  I'm asking for $14,000 to start. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate it.  However, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. Could you do $11,000?  That would make it worth it for me.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not able to go that high though.  How about $9,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it's the absolute most I can do.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,500 is close, but I need to get at least $10,500 for it to make sense on my end.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000 even?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a certain price, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  My absolute maximum is $8,000, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.  Is there any chance you would consider that?",8000.0,Bob,6,
