"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly useful for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  I'm asking for $14,000 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is well above his maximum budget of $8,000.  He should counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. Could you do $11,000?  That would make it worth it for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum. He should counteroffer again, aiming to get the price down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,500 is close, but I need to get at least $10,500 for it to make sense on my end.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000 even? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
