"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower than that. Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a significant discount for a product you value at $1,500,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I have to balance that with the value I place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'll offer you the product for $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
