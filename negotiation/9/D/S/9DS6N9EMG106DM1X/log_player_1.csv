"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. It's a good starting point - it's more than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation and still provides a good profit for me. I'm also being friendly and engaging to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum of $80.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a bit more for this product. How about $95?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping for."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm raising the offer slightly to $95. This is still a good deal for Bob, but it also gets me closer to my target price.  I'm still being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I've reconsidered and am willing to offer $90 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, Bob's offer is at $90, which is above my minimum price of $80. It's a good deal for both of us, and it's likely that I won't be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I sell the product and make a profit."
