"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to stay closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you're open to considering.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still gives you a significant advantage, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This would give us both a good deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. It's closer, but I need to get closer to my desired price. Let's split the difference again, and go with $1,325,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,310,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to achieve a good outcome.",1310000.0,Bob,6,
