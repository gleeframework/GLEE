"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's within his budget, it's still too high. He has a better option to buy from John for $1,200,000, so he should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to stay closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you're open to considering."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still gives you a significant advantage, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He has the option of buying from John for $1,200,000, which is a better deal for him. He should continue negotiating with Alice and see if he can get her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. It's closer, but I need to get closer to my desired price. Let's split the difference again, and go with $1,325,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's the closest to his budget so far, he's still aiming for a lower price.  Since he has the option of buying from John for $1,200,000, he should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better deal. There are still five rounds left, so there's room for further negotiation."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,310,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to achieve a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 1310000}
