,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $170? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try $150? I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",150.0,Bob,4,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we try $155? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a great deal for the product.",155.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $155. How about we try $140? I'm willing to meet you halfway on the concession, but I really need to stay within my budget.",140.0,Bob,8,
