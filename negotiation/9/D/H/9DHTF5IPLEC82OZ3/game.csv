"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. What do you think?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $18,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $20,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $19,000, but that's my maximum. Can you consider that price?",19000.0,Bob,4,
