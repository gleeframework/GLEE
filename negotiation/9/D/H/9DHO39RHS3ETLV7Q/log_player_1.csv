Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can push for a higher price given Bob's clear interest. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I value your interest, $1,100,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  Let's compromise.

Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While he's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to drop below $1,100,000 at this point. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round and see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is getting close to my minimum but still below it. We are nearing the end of the negotiation, and while I could make another counteroffer, I'm concerned we might not reach an agreement.  I've also considered the risk of continuing and potentially ending up with nothing.  To avoid that risk, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's not my ideal outcome, but it ensures a sale and a guaranteed profit."
