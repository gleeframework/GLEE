"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still potentially profitable for her. This leaves room for further negotiation while expressing our interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but we still have some room for negotiation before considering John's offer. Let's see if we can get her down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $82 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $75. Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We are moving closer to Alice's minimum price, but still aiming for a price closer to our target. This keeps the negotiation open while showing Alice we are serious about buying at the right price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $79? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This seems like a good deal to take. Alice is signaling this is close to her minimum, and the price is well below our alternative option of buying from John.  We've successfully negotiated a good discount."
