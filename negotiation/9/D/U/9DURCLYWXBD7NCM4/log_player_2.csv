"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. We have 10 rounds and want to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows us to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $200,000. This demonstrates our serious interest in the product while still leaving room for further negotiation. It's a good starting point to see how flexible Alice is willing to be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but this product is worth significantly more.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value and gives us both a good outcome. Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  We're looking for a price closer to our initial counteroffer of $1,200,000.  We have 7 rounds left to negotiate a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows us to continue the negotiation and potentially achieve a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're showing a willingness to compromise by meeting Alice halfway between her previous offer and our last counteroffer.  This demonstrates our commitment to finding a solution while still leaving some room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,275,000, which is closer to our desired price and only $25,000 above our last counteroffer.  With only 5 rounds left, it's a good time to accept.  While we could try to push for a lower price, the risk of failing to reach an agreement and having to buy from John at a higher price is too great.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a price within our budget and allows for potential future savings."
