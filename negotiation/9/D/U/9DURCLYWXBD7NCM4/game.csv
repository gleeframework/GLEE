,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but this product is worth significantly more.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value and gives us both a good outcome. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that we can both be happy with.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
