"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,750? This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I'm really interested in the product.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,125? This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're open to this.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $10,125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,900. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I really hope we can come to an agreement.",9900.0,Bob,6,
