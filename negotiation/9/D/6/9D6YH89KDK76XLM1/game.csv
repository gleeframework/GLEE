"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $7,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm still not willing to go below $7,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $7,350. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",7350.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,350 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $7,200? That's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal right now.",7200.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $7,250. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $7,275. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",7275.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $7,200. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $7,250. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options.",7250.0,Alice,7,
