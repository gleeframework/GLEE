# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $12,000 is lower than $15,000. 
* **You still get a good deal:**  You value the product at $15,000, and you're buying it for $12,000, saving $3,000."
