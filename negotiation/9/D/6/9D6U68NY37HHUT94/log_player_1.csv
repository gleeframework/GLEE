Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($8,000).
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but ensures you're significantly above your fallback price.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning you'll list it publicly (which implies other potential buyers) creates a subtle sense of urgency and competition. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
