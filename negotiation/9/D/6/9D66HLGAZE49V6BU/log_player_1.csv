Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first before I list it publicly. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,500."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $8,000.
* **John's Value (Your Safety Net):**  John provides a guaranteed sale at $15,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible from Bob without completely discouraging him.
* **Psychology:** Offering a price slightly below the guaranteed sale price ($14,500) might make Bob feel like he's getting a deal and could encourage him to accept.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate further, or he might decline outright. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit while considering the information you have about Bob's valuation."
