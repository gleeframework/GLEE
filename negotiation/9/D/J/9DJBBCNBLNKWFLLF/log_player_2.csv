"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet your specific needs and expectations. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I would like to offer it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* There's no reason to accept the offer in the first round. 
* It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first. 
* Buying from John immediately is only necessary if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's features, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be happy to pay $11,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so he's offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. 
* This counteroffer is within Bob's budget and leaves room for potential negotiation in subsequent rounds. 
* A lower initial counteroffer might encourage Alice to be more flexible in the negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our product's quality and the value it brings, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
*  While it's closer, Bob can still potentially negotiate a better price.
* It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice will come down further. 
* Buying from John at this point is a viable option, but it's better to see if a better deal can be reached with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $12,000?  That's my absolute top limit, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is sticking to his budget and making a final offer at his maximum limit.
* He's expressing confidence in reaching a deal, hoping to nudge Alice towards accepting.
* This is a strong counteroffer, but it also leaves room for Alice to potentially counter with a slightly lower price, potentially leading to a successful deal in the next round."
