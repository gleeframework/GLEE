Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $15,000 gives us room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers.  It's a good starting point to gauge his interest and potential budget.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to us, potentially creating a sense of urgency and value for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly invites Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Unknown Value to Bob:** We have no information about Bob's willingness to pay. A higher initial offer might scare him off, while a lower offer might be seen as too low and leave us with less room for negotiation. 
* **John's Offer:**  We can always walk away and sell to John for $12,000. This provides a safety net and a benchmark for our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob has essentially offered our minimum acceptable price.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk in rejecting and counteroffering. If we push too hard, Bob might walk away, and we'll be left with John's offer, which is the same as Bob's current offer.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiating further might take time and energy. Accepting Bob's offer allows us to close the deal quickly and secure our minimum desired profit. 

**In this situation, the benefits of accepting Bob's offer outweigh the potential risks of continuing to negotiate.**"
