It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  You can likely get a better deal than $900,000 by counteroffering."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired maximum.  Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a reasonable price considering my maximum budget and the fact that I could buy it from John for $1,000,000.  It's a good deal, so I'll accept."
