{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Current Offer:** $1,100,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Strategy:** Reject the offer and counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further. This gives Bob a chance to secure a better price."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Current Offer:**  $1,100,000 -  This is above Bob's budget, but he wants to see if Alice is willing to compromise.
* **Counteroffer:** $1,050,000 - This offer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within Bob's budget and a reasonable starting point for negotiation.

**Strategy:** Bob aims to test the waters with a lower offer and see if Alice is open to negotiation. He's willing to compromise, but he's also determined to secure a good deal."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,075,000. This is a significant improvement from her previous offer, and it's within Bob's budget.
