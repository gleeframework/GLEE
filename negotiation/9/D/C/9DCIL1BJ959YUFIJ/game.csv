"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet halfway between our last offers at $900,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
