"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a rare opportunity to acquire something truly unique, and I believe it's worth at least $1200000. To kick things off, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer!  The product is definitely interesting, but I'm not quite ready to pay $1400000. My budget for this purchase is $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is a bit too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not ready to drop that much.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $1325000? This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
