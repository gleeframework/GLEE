"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a rare opportunity to acquire something truly unique, and I believe it's worth at least $1200000. To kick things off, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,400,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is a bit too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not ready to drop that much.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate lower.  There's a good chance Alice will come down further rather than risk losing the sale to John."
