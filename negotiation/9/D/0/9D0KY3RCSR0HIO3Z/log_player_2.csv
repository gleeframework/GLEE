"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. I understand you may not know its full potential, but I'm confident it could be worth a lot more than the price I'm offering. I'm asking $1500000 for it. If you're interested, I'd be happy to explain the details and answer any questions you might have. However, if you're not interested, I have a guaranteed buyer willing to purchase it from me for $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
