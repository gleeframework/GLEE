Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $8,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $8,500.  Since John is offering the product for $8,000, it makes more sense to take the sure thing and buy from John."
