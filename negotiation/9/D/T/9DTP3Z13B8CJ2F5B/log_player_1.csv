Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This shows Bob that you value the product and are not desperate to sell.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a more dynamic negotiation process and potentially leads to a higher final price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your desired price:**  While $1,100,000 is a better offer than your initial proposal, it's still below your target and leaves some room for improvement.
* **You want to maximize profit:** Selling to John at $800,000 would be a significant loss compared to what you believe the product is worth. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  You can make a counteroffer to Bob, potentially closer to your desired $1,200,000 or even higher.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you keep the negotiation open and have the potential to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise,  showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Keeping pressure on Bob:**  By offering a price closer to your original proposal, you emphasize that you still believe the product is worth more. 
* **Maintaining bargaining power:** This counteroffer is high enough to still be profitable for you, but low enough to give Bob a sense of progress.

Let's see if Bob accepts your compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is getting lower:** This indicates that Bob is trying to push for a lower price, likely sensing your willingness to negotiate.
* **You're still above your minimum:**  While $1,050,000 is lower than your desired price, it's still significantly higher than what you would receive from John. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  You can likely push for a higher price with another counteroffer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering again, you continue the negotiation process and have a chance to secure a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:**  This counteroffer is a significant concession, but still leaves you with a profit significantly higher than selling to John.
* **Signaling your willingness to finalize the deal:** By offering a price close to Bob's last offer, you show that you're serious about concluding the deal.
* **Maximizing potential profit:** While this offer might not be your ideal outcome, it's still the best option compared to selling to John or continuing to negotiate with Bob, which might lead to a lower price.

Let's see if Bob will finally accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiations are stagnating:** Bob's counteroffer is the same as his previous one, indicating he is not willing to budge further.
* **Risk of further price decrease:** Continuing the negotiation might lead to even lower offers from Bob, potentially jeopardizing the potential profit.
* **Securing a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $800,000, which is significant and worth securing instead of risking further negotiation. 

While the ideal outcome was a higher sale price to Bob, selling to John at this point offers the most reliable and secure financial outcome."
