"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is considerably below its true value and my initial asking price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This considers the product's unique benefits and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can offer $700,000.  This is a fair offer considering the market value of similar products.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions remains substantial.  I need to be transparent:  I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. I'm willing to continue our discussion, but I'm only open to offers significantly closer to my previous number.  This is my final offer, and I need a decision.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
