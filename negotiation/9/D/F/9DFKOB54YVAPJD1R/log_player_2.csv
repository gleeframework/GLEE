Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is considerably below its true value and my initial asking price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This considers the product's unique benefits and ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can offer $700,000.  This is a fair offer considering the market value of similar products."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions remains substantial.  I need to be transparent:  I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. I'm willing to continue our discussion, but I'm only open to offers significantly closer to my previous number.  This is my final offer, and I need a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough negotiation game and her latest offer still significantly exceeds your budget. While she claims to have another buyer, there's no guarantee this is true. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with no deal at all. Buying from John at $800,000 ensures you get the product within your budget."
