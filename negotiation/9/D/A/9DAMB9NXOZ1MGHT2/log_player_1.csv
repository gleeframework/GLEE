Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to me is much higher.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him a reason to negotiate, but it's not so far above his value that he'll immediately reject. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  This gives you room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:**  This helps build rapport and increases the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's far below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, Alice. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, Bob's offer is still too low.  $9,500 is just not enough considering my minimum is $15,000.  I'm going to sell to John, who is offering a much better price."
