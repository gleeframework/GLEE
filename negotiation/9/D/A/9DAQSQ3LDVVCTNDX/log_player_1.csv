Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $14,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum.  While I want to be flexible, accepting a $6,000 offer means losing a lot of potential profit. I'll try to negotiate a better price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $6,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. To find a middle ground, how about we consider $11,000?  I believe this price reflects the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $7,500 is still too low for me.  Would you consider $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're valuing this product highly, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to do $8,500? That's my final offer.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a close call! Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, and he's indicated it's his final offer.  If I push further, I risk losing him entirely.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting stuck with the product or settling for John's offer later.
