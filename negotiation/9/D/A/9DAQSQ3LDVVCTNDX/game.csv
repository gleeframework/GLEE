"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $6,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. To find a middle ground, how about we consider $11,000?  I believe this price reflects the product's true value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $7,500 is still too low for me.  Would you consider $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Alice,5,
