"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Since Alice's offer is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, and John is also selling it for that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. I'll buy from John."
