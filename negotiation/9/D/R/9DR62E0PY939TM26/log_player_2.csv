"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. I think this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further. He has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $8,000, so he has room to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is still quite a bit below what I need. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $9250. This is a fair compromise that's within both our ranges. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is better than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can still do better.  He's already gotten Alice down significantly, and he's still within range of buying from John for $8,000. He should keep negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair compromise that's closer to both of our desired prices. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and is closer to your offer. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still not within his ideal range.  He's already had four rounds of negotiation and it's likely that Alice won't budge much further. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John for $8,000. This ensures he gets the product at his desired price and avoids further rounds of potentially unproductive negotiation."
