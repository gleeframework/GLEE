"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am not able to meet the price of $1,150,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the value of the product to both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
