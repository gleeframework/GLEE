Alice's starting price is too high.  It's important to negotiate a lower price and try to meet somewhere closer to the middle of our valuations."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I think $9,500 is a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
