"While I appreciate the offer, $18,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $14,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $17,000, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $15,500, which is a fair compromise.  I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a serious buyer, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to go all the way to $15,500. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get a good price for your product, and I'm trying to get a good deal.  Let's split the difference and go with $15,750. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you say?",15750.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way to $15,750. I'm willing to meet you at $16,250, which is still a great value for this exceptional product. What do you think?",16250.0,Alice,7,
