"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and counteroffering.  Since Alice values the product at $800,000, there's room for negotiation.  

**Next Steps:**

Bob should counteroffer with a price lower than $950,000, aiming to secure a price closer to his desired value or Alice's perceived value."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price still allows for a significant profit for you, and it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by rejecting and counteroffering. He can aim for a price closer to $850,000, which is his initial counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

Bob should counteroffer again, perhaps suggesting a price in the range of $875,000 to $885,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still trying to maximize his savings."
