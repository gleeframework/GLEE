Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:** $12,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000.
* **Below Bob's maximum:** $12,000 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation. 

This strategy gives you a good chance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement while maximizing your potential profit."
