"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to consider $140?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,160.0
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to go as low as $140. How about $160? It's a bit more than what I initially offered, but I think it's a fair price for this great product.",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down a bit. However, $160 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $150? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. ",150.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can do $155, but I was thinking we could meet in the middle again. How about $152.50? It's a bit of a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this great product.",152.5,Alice,5,,
