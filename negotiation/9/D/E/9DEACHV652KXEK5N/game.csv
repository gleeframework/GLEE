"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value. However, I'm confident this product can bring you significant returns, and I need to price it accordingly. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $11,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,500 is close, but to make this work, I need to be at $10,500. This is a fair offer considering the product's potential value.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500, which is $10,000. I think that's a fair price for the product.",10000.0,Bob,6,
