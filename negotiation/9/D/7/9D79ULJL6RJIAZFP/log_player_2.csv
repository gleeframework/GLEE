# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you'll find quite valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $12,000 saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Even though the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, it's worth $15,000 to you, so paying $12,000 is a good deal."
