{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,450,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob. 
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** While you know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, starting too high could scare him off. This offer leaves room for negotiation if needed.

**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer, but this strategy maximizes your potential profit while still being realistic about Bob's valuation."
