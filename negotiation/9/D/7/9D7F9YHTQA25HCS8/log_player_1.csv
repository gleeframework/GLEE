Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line. This could make Bob more receptive to a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is above Bob's perceived value, it leaves some space for potential counter-offers or negotiation. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to gauge Bob's interest and adjust your approach accordingly. If he seems completely turned off by the initial offer, you might need to significantly lower the price to close the deal before he walks away."
