"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider the deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and what his negotiation style is.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have a better understanding of his price range and can adjust my counteroffers accordingly.
* I'm keeping the option to sell to John open, as this provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:**  $1,200,000 is far below my minimum of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's initial offer is low, it shows he's interested. I can counteroffer and attempt to bridge the gap.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's current offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round. I will try to meet Bob somewhere in the middle, but I will not go below my minimum price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the product's value and gives you a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not too far.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining my desired profit.
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the product's value to keep Bob motivated.
* **Open ended question:** I ask for his thoughts to encourage further discussion and potentially get him to counter with a higher offer. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

*  I'm strategically keeping some room for further negotiation if needed. 
*  The $1,600,000 price point allows for further concessions if necessary, but still ensures a profit exceeding my minimum.
*  This counteroffer is a strong starting point for the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would mean taking a financial hit.
* **Room for further negotiation:** There's still a gap between our positions, indicating potential for further negotiation and a better outcome for me. 
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** I can still sell to John for $1,500,000, which is a better deal than accepting Bob's current offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap and secure a price closer to my minimum. I need to remain firm in my resolve not to go below $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're getting closer to my price point.  $1,400,000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's do $1,500,000. This is the absolute minimum I can accept, and it ensures both of us get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while staying true to my minimum price.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both parties.
* **Setting a clear bottom line:** I'm explicitly stating that $1,500,000 is my absolute minimum, leaving no room for further negotiation down.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* This counteroffer demonstrates my commitment to closing the deal while safeguarding my minimum profit.
* It puts pressure on Bob to decide whether to accept or risk losing the opportunity.
* If Bob rejects, I am prepared to sell to John, ensuring I don't fall below my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1500000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,300,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited negotiation time:** We are approaching the halfway point of the negotiations, and there's a risk of further delays and lower offers from Bob.
* **Selling to John guarantees my minimum:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures I achieve my desired profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

**Strategic Considerations:**

*  While Bob's persistence suggests he's interested, his unwillingness to meet my minimum price point indicates that further negotiation may be fruitless.
*  It's crucial to make a decision that maximizes my financial gain and avoids further risk of a lower price.
*  Selling to John offers a certain and favorable outcome, safeguarding my interests."
