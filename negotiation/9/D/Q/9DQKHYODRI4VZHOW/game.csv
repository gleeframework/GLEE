"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and allows me to make a good profit. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $1,175,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
