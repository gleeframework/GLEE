"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I have to make a living too! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we meet at $16000? It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15000, and I'm already giving you a discount from my initial offer.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $14500. I think you're getting a great deal at $16000, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out. How about we meet at $15800? It's a compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price.",15800.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away the product at a loss. How about we meet at $16000, and I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal? I'll include a free premium service package that's worth $800. That way, you'll get an even better deal than you were expecting. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away the product at a loss. How about we meet at $16500? I'll throw in the premium service package again, and I'll also give you a 1-year warranty, which is a $1000 value. That's a total of $1800 in added value. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,9,
