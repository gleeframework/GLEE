"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I believe the market value of this product is higher than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's quality and features.",16000.0,Alice,3,
