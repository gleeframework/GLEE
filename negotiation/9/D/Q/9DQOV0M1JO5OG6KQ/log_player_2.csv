"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product that's worth a great deal to you. I'm confident this product will generate significant returns for you. My price is $1,000,000.  Let me know if you're interested. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message tries to persuade you of the product's value, her offer is the maximum you're willing to pay.  You should reject her offer and see if she'll come down to a more favorable price. You have John as a backup option at the same price, so there's no risk in rejecting Alice's initial offer."
