"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $115? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price!",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about $105? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you agree.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $105. How about we try $112? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but I can't go higher than $108.  Take it or leave it.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $115. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. How about we meet in the middle at $111? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",111.0,Alice,7,
