# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

This is a good deal! Alice is throwing in extras to meet the price point. It's unlikely she'll go much lower and we're far below John's price."
