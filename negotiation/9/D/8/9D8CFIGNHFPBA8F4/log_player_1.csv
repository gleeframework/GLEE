"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum.  It sets a starting point for negotiation, leaving room for potential concessions without dropping below your minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,000?  That would be a good starting point for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a decent offer and significantly closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.  

I believe there's room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle for a price that is too far below my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I think that would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer represents a compromise. It's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value. I'm hoping this demonstrates good faith and encourages Bob to continue the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on the price.  I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is my final offer, so I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiations for a few more rounds but will be prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't budge much further.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle for a price that is too far below my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're serious about the product.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  It's a small increase, and it's the most I can offer at this point."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my offer a bit, showing flexibility and willingness to meet halfway. However, I'm still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer demonstrates a continued commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution while also ensuring I don't compromise my own financial goals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $9,750.  This is my final offer, and it's the closest I can go without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  I've made several concessions, and it's becoming apparent that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell to John for $15,000, securing my desired value and avoiding further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
