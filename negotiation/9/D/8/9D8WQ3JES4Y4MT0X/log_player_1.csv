{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a significant discount** from the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,500,000), making it attractive to Bob.
* **Leaves room for negotiation** as Bob is likely to counteroffer.
* **Shows a willingness to negotiate**, which can build rapport. 

I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price through negotiation, but I also have the backup option of selling to John if the negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my desired price.  I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  I'll send him a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a significant discount for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to see if I can get a better offer from Bob. I'll send him a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $1,050,000? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I'm still a bit short on funds. I'd be willing to go up to $980,000. That's the absolute max I can afford. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob and continue the negotiation, his offer of $980,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a much better offer, and it's not worth the risk of losing time and potentially selling for an even lower price. 

I'm confident that John will buy the product for my desired price, making this the most sensible decision."
