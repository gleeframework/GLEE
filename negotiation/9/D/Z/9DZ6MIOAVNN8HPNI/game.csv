"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This is a fair price for a product worth so much to you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1300000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1350000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
