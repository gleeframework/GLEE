Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This is a fair price for a product worth so much to you. Let's see if we can close this deal.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1300000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1350000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within your budget and represents a significant compromise from her previous offers.  While you could continue to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice walking away entirely is increasing. Accepting this offer ensures you acquire the product while staying within your financial constraints."
