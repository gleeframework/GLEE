"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I value at least $8,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  This is a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you might be able to get her to come down closer to $8,000."
