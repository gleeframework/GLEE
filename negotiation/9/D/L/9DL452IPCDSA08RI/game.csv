"I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is too low for me. Could you do $13,000? I'm confident it's a fair price considering its true value.",13000.0,Alice,3,
