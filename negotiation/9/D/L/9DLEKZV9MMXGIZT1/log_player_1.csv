"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a strong opening position, and I believe it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. However, I'm also aware that if he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob rejects."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,150,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to settle.  I'm hoping to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm countering with $1,250,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a sign of my willingness to negotiate and come closer to his offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still hoping to get a bit more than $1,100,000. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can push for a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000}
```

I'm offering $1,175,000. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but I believe it shows good faith and demonstrates my desire to reach an agreement. We're getting close to a potential deal, so I want to be sure we're not too far apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but I'm running out of time.  I'm concerned that if I reject, he might not come back with another offer or his offers might get lower.  To guarantee a sale above my minimum, it's safer to sell to John at this point."
