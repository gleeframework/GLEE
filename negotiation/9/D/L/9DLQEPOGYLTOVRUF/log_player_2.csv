"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I think you'll find it's worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John if necessary. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer at a lower price. There's no harm in trying to negotiate a better deal."
