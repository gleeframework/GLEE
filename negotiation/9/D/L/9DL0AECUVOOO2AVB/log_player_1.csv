Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd like to offer $750,000.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value to me and the potential for future collaboration. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
