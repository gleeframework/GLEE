"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is too high.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd like to offer $750,000.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value to me and the potential for future collaboration. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What are your thoughts?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. There's still room for negotiation, so I will reject and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still above my target price. To bridge the gap, I'm offering $800,000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value to me and would allow us to finalize the transaction. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to budge further. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a decent return on my investment. I'm proposing a new offer of $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope it's acceptable to you. If not, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is closer to my target price.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will budge, and I risk losing this deal and having to buy from John for a much higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action, as it saves me over $675,000 compared to John's offer."
