Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $90? It's still a good deal for me, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $90, and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer. Buying from John at $80 guarantees the best price for your limit."
