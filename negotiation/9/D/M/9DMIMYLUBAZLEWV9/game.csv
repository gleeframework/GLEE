"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make this work.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair compromise between our positions.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $90? It's still a good deal for me, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
