"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, so this is a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I believe I can get more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come up. $1,350,000 is still a good price for me, and it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has stuck to his offer of $1,200,000.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing this sale. $1,200,000 is still a significant profit for me and a fair deal for both parties."
