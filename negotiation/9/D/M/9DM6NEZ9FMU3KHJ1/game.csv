,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This still allows you to save a significant amount compared to buying from John. ",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $14,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to come down a bit more. Would you be willing to do $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $12,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,5,
