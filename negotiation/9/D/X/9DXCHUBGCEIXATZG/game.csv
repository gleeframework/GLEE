"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be just as valuable for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its worth and the fact that I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $10,000. Let me know if you're interested!",10500.0,Alice,1,
