{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than what it's worth to me. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price. I'm also adding a friendly message to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me, and even lower than what it's worth to him.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3

```

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $14,250 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable going above $13,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,750 and $14,250. How about $14,000?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough one!  While $14,000 is still below my minimum, it's very close and we're running out of rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John for less than what the product is worth to me.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
