"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your generosity, but my budget for this product is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $14000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the gesture, I'm still looking to keep the cost within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $15000. This seems to be closer to what I am able to afford at this time.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $16000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $15500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget constraints. I would like to counter with an offer of $15000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the product's value to both of us.",15000.0,Bob,6,
