"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is still fair to you, considering the value to me, and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the value to me and the fact that I'm ready to make a deal today. Let's see if we can shake hands on this.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still not willing to go below $920,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you and the original price I was thinking of. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $885,000.
