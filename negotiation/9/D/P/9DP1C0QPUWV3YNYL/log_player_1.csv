Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my goal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a great deal for a product worth much more, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```
 
 I'm offering $140. This is a compromise, but it's still within my minimum price range. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and agree to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is still too low.  I'm firm on $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm sticking close to my minimum but still leaving room for some negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see that $135 is a fair price and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're firm on $135, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer,  $125 is still below my minimum price. I'm going to reject his offer and try for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not going to go any lower than $130. This is a fair price for a valuable product. If you're not willing to pay that, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

I'm sticking firm on $130. This is my last offer. I'm hoping Bob will realize the value of the product and agree to buy it at this price. If not, I'm ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're not willing to go lower than $130, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle at $127.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for several rounds now, and it seems like we're at an impasse.  His offer of $127.5 is still below my minimum price of $150.  While I could continue to negotiate,  I'm concerned that I'm wasting time and may not be able to get a higher price from Bob. 

Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. This guarantees me my minimum price and saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
