"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective on the value, but $600,000 is too low for me to consider. Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go.",750000.0,Bob,4,
