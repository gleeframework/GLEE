Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but I'm not comfortable going that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. This still gives you a significant gain while allowing me to get closer to the value I place on the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, but no higher. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $13,000, Bob's offer of $12,500 is still a good deal.  I'm going to accept his offer to secure the sale."
