"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you're willing to make a counteroffer. However, I have to say that $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My next counteroffer is $1,280,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so let me know if it's acceptable to you.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
