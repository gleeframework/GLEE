# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

Alice's initial offer is too high.  I'm willing to pay less than $1,100,000. I'll reject her offer and counter-offer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring the product's value is reflected.
