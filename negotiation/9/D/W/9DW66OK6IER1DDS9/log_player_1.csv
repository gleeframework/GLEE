{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I believe it's a great deal for you, given its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price, but leaves some room for negotiation, recognizing Bob's potential higher value for the product. It also establishes a friendly tone to encourage a productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $14000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I believe the product is worth more and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to counter-offer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This would still be a good deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13500}
