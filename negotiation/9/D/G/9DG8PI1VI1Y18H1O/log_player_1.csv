{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going all-in on the first offer, allowing space for Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Protecting my minimum value:** $12,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 

**Strategy:**

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he counters, I'll aim to find a price that is both acceptable to him and still benefits me. If he rejects outright, I'll have to consider whether to lower my price or sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000 and even below what Bob values the product at ($8,000). Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can reach a better price.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which is my minimum desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $6,000 but lower than my initial offer of $12,000. I'll aim to find a middle ground that is more attractive to Bob while still exceeding my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a middle ground:** I'm offering $9,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $6,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my minimum value. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce why $9,000 is a fair price. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, so I'm not losing money with this offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept. If he rejects again, I might consider lowering my offer slightly but will only do so if I believe there's a strong chance of closing the deal. If he rejects again, I'll likely sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer to my minimum, $7,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm aiming for at least $9,000.
* **John's offer remains the best option:** Selling to John for $15,000 is still the most profitable choice, and I'm not convinced I can reach a deal with Bob at a more favorable price.
* **The risk of lowering my offer:** Lowering my offer further could lead to Bob rejecting it again, potentially forcing me to settle for an even lower price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob again, but I'll be prepared to move towards selling to John if my next offer is rejected. I'll need to carefully assess the risk versus reward of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,000, which is a good compromise considering the value of the product. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer who's willing to pay $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm making this my final offer to Bob, creating urgency and putting the ball in his court.
* **Slight concession:** I'm lowering my price to $8,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price but still above my minimum.
* **Highlighting alternatives:** I'm reminding Bob of the alternative offer from John to emphasize the risk of losing the deal. 

**Strategy:**

This is a high-stakes offer.  If Bob accepts, I'll get a decent price. If he rejects, I'll move forward with selling to John for the guaranteed $15,000. This strategy balances the desire for a higher price with the need to avoid a lengthy negotiation that could result in a lower final price."
