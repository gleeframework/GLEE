Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I also want to see if he's willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm starting to get concerned about running out of rounds, $1,350,000 is still too low for me. I'm hoping I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge, and we are running out of rounds. I'm concerned about hitting my minimum, but at this point, it's better to sell to John and get a guaranteed $1,500,000 than risk getting a lower offer from Bob or running out of time."
