"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit high for me.  How about $8,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a good compromise for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference -  $8,875. This would allow us to close the deal and both be satisfied. What do you say?",8875.0,Alice,5,
