Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $20,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need it to be much lower. How about we try $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $12,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I could go up to $7,000, but that's my absolute limit."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise again, so I'm counteroffering $10,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $15,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between that and the $8,000 you mentioned earlier. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $7,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. However, I need to get closer to my minimum price of $15,000. I'm counteroffering $9,500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the concessions I've already made. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $9,000, and even if she did, it would be cutting it close to our $8,000 limit. John offers a guaranteed deal at our ideal price."
