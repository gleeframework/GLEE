"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $85. I'm willing to consider $92, which is a bit closer to my original price. Let me know if that works for you.",92.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer! I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $92. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $92, which would be $88.50. Would you be willing to consider that?",88.5,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $88.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92 and $88.50, which would be $90.25. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",90.25,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $90.25. I'm willing to go up to $87, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",87.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $87. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90.25 and $87, which would be $88.625. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think this is as low as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",88.625,Alice,7,
