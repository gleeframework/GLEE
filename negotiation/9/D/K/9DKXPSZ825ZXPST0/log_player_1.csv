"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $120. Would you be interested in purchasing it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

This is a strategic first offer. It's important to strike a balance between being too aggressive and leaving no room for negotiation, and being too passive and letting Bob dictate the terms.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. Since I have 10 rounds, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $100, which acts as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a little lower than I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  This would still be a great deal for you and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering $95, which is exactly halfway between my initial offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $85. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Reasoning:** I'm justifying my counteroffer by highlighting the value for both of us.

This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable sale. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm aware that we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at a reasonable price and avoid the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower offer or having to sell to John for $100."
