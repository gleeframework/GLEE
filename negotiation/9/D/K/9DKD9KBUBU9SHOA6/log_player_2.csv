"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price of $850000. It's a rare opportunity to own a unique item that's worth $800000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable addition to your collection. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's offer of $850,000 is higher than Bob's maximum value of $800,000.  It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $810000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this unique item. Let me know if this is something you'd be comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $810,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum value of $800,000. Bob should reject this offer and continue negotiating. While John is offering the product for $800,000, Bob should try to get a better price from Alice if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $810,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $780,000, which is closer to your price and a reasonable compromise.  Let's see if we can finalise a deal."", ""product_price"": 780000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $820000? It's a bit more than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $820,000 is still above Bob's maximum value of $800,000. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of going back and forth for a longer time with no guarantee of a better deal exists.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000. This ensures a guaranteed purchase within his budget."
