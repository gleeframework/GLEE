"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? That would give you a fair price and allow me to cover my costs. ",105.0,Alice,3,
