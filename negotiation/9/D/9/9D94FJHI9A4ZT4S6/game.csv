"Alice,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $900,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to find a fair deal, $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
