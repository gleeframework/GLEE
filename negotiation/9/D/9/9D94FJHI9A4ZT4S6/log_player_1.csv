Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $900,000 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to find a fair deal, $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing more willingness to negotiate, the gap between his offer and John's guaranteed offer is too significant. It's unlikely Bob will reach the $1,200,000 mark. Accepting John's offer ensures the best possible outcome for me in this situation."
