Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me some room for negotiation, while still being realistic. If Bob rejects, I can then assess if it's worth continuing negotiations with him or if I should just sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll need to make a counteroffer to see if we can come to a more acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is still above Bob's offer, but closer to his value of $8,000.  Hopefully, he'll be willing to meet me in the middle. If not, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $8,000."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and it's becoming clear that we're too far apart. I don't want to risk another round of negotiation and end up with a price lower than John's offer.  Selling to John for $8,000 is the best option at this point."
