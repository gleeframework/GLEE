I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a price that is higher than the product's value to me, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this price reflects the value the product holds for Bob while also allowing for potential profit on my end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above the product's value to me.  I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's initial low offer.  I'm hoping this will incentivize him to reach a deal without me having to sell to John for the lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is continuing to offer a price that is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  While I'd prefer to sell it to Bob, I am not willing to go lower than my minimum.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
