Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its significant value to you, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Knowing the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000) allows Alice to start high, maximizing potential profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value but leaves some space for potential counter-offers.  
* **Time pressure:** The 24-hour limit creates urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept without extended negotiation. 
* **Backup plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice still has a guaranteed sale to John for $800,000. 

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale."
