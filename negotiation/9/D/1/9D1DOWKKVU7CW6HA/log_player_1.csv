Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation if he's interested.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, but I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $80 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $75.  While it's more than what I would get from John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $85. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm hoping this will be a fair price for both of us and lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $78.  While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $80, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can reach an agreement. If not, I can always sell to John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm going to counter-offer with a price of $82. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. I believe this is a fair compromise, and hopefully, Bob will be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $79 is only $1 less than what John is offering, I'm going to choose to sell to John.  The negotiation has gone on for a while, and I'm concerned that Bob may not be willing to meet my minimum price.  It's better to secure the $80 sale with John than to risk further negotiation and possibly end up with a lower price."
