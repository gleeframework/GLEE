"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $145 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let's make this deal happen!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $130 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we split the difference and do $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $115 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  That's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
