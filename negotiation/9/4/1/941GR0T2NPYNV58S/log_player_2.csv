"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, but I believe this is a fair starting point.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This recognizes the product's worth while still offering you substantial value.
