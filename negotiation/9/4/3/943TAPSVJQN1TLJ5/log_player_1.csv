Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth at least $100 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum desired price ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** $110 is still within a reasonable range for Bob to potentially accept, as it's only $30 higher than his perceived value. 
* **Establishing value:** My message emphasizes the value of the product to me, subtly suggesting it might be worth more to Bob as well. 

This initial offer sets a high bar while being open to negotiation. It allows me to see if Bob is truly interested at a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $100 threshold I've set for myself.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I might be able to get a higher price than $90.
* **John as a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $100 if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me the flexibility to hold out for a better deal. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for a price below my minimum and keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $90 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($90) and my previous offer ($110). This shows I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Highlighting value again:** I reiterate the value of the product, subtly implying that $95 is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive tone:**  I maintain a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a price closer to my desired range.  It aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited room for further negotiation:**  While Bob has shown interest, his offer is already quite low. Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, potentially even below $80, which wouldn't be profitable.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $100, which is higher than Bob's current offer and meets my minimum requirement.

Since Bob's offer is below my minimum and further negotiation might lead to an even lower price, selling to John is the most logical and profitable choice. This ensures I don't lose out on a guaranteed profit and avoids potential further negotiation that might result in a lower price."
