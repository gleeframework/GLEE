# Alice's message: I'm offering you an exclusive deal on this amazing product, worth $150 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $140, a steal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget of $150. You can reject Alice's offer and still purchase the product from John, even though it will cost you more."
