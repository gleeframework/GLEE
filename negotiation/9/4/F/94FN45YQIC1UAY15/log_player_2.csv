Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $115. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, this time at $125. Let me know if that's more acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $125, and I'm not going to get a better deal than John's offer of $120. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
