{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the ""win-win"" nature of the deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Negotiation Space:**  By starting with a price lower than my minimum, I create space for negotiation without immediately triggering a rejection.
* **Attractive Offer:**  $1,200,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $800,000.
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** This strategy encourages Bob to counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his true interest and potentially move closer to my desired price.

I'll be ready to adapt my strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll assess whether to counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even below his own perceived value of $800,000.  It's clear he's trying to lowball me.  

**Why reject?**

* **Lowball:**  This offer is too low to consider.
* **Potential for Counteroffer:**  By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer and try to push him closer to a price I'm comfortable with.

**Next steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range while still acknowledging his limitations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $900,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my position.
* **Message:** The message reiterates the value of the product and emphasizes the possibility of a ""fair"" deal. This creates a positive tone and encourages further negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation:** By counteroffering, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not at his price. This keeps the conversation going.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $900,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his value of $800,000. This increases the chances of him accepting.
* **Avoiding John:**  This counteroffer is a strategy to see if I can get a better price from Bob than John's offer, before I commit to selling to John.

I'll analyze Bob's next move and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still too low for me. While it's a compromise, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even below his own perceived value of $800,000.

**Why reject?**

* **Low Price:** This offer is still not in my best interest.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer again, trying to push the price closer to my desired range. I'll aim for a price that's reasonable for both of us, considering Bob's limitations but also reflecting the true value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a fair price.  How about $850,000? This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $850,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $750,000. This demonstrates my willingness to meet in the middle while still holding onto a significant portion of the value I see in the product.
* **Message:** I'm using positive language, emphasizing compromise and the possibility of reaching an agreement. This encourages Bob to consider my offer seriously. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Common Ground:**  This counteroffer is a genuine attempt to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm showing flexibility but not backing down from the value I know the product holds.
* **Avoiding John:** I'm still hoping to close a deal with Bob, as selling to John would mean a lower profit for me. 
* **Strategic Compromise:** By offering a price slightly above Bob's offer, I'm making him feel like he's winning while still securing a price closer to my ideal.

I'm prepared to consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy if necessary. If this counteroffer is rejected, I'll have to decide whether to continue negotiating with Bob or move on to John."
