Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. A counteroffer of $950,000 represents a substantial price reduction while still leaving some room for Alice to negotiate. It's a bold move that shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's perceived value of the product. Offering $1,000,000 shows that he understands the product's worth to Alice while still keeping the price within his budget. This counteroffer could be enticing for Alice and lead to a quicker deal."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Although it's getting closer to Bob's budget, there's still potential to get a better deal. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to his goal. It's also important to remember that Bob has a safety net in John, so there's less pressure to accept an offer that's not satisfactory."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, demonstrating his commitment to the deal while still trying to get a lower price.  $1,050,000 is a significant compromise from his previous offer and shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product. This could be a tempting price for Alice, and might encourage her to accept the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now equal to John's price, meaning there's no further benefit to negotiating with Alice.  Bob is better off buying from John at this point, as there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a lower price.  There's also a risk of wasting time and possibly missing the deal with John."
