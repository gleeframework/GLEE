"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a bit above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but still significantly below Bob's perceived value. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my ideal.  I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and could lead to a successful deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is now offering my minimum price. While I'm not losing money, it's also not a good deal for me. I've had several rounds of negotiation and it's becoming clear that Bob is unwilling to pay significantly more.  To maximize my profit, I will sell the product to John for $10,000."
