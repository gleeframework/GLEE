Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm setting the price at $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows Bob's value is lower than hers, but there's room for negotiation. Starting at $15,000 leaves space to potentially come down while still staying above her minimum.
* **Creating Perceived Value:** Mentioning ""other interest"" and not publicly listing it yet implies the product is in demand and valuable. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The message aims to get Bob talking and reveal how interested he truly is. His response will help Alice decide her next move. 

**Important Note:** Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate. If Bob outright rejects the initial offer, she can gradually lower the price (while staying above $12,000) or offer incentives to make the deal more appealing."
