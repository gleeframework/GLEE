"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a good price, and I get a quick sale. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm more comfortable in the $600,000 range.  What do you say?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a ways off from that number.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a substantial sum.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your point. $700,000 is a good offer. However, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about $750,000?  Let's split the difference.  I'm sure we can find a happy medium.",750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you halfway at $725,000.  That's my final offer.",725000.0,Bob,6,
