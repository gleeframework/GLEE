While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not high enough. I'm willing to take a small risk and continue negotiating, hoping to reach a more favorable price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are close to my minimum, but not quite there.  I've already given up a significant amount of potential profit in the negotiation process. To avoid further risk of losing even more money, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
