"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to Bob and my minimum acceptable price. I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but I'm also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $13,500 is still lower than my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to accept a price that is significantly below my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13800}
``` 

I'm countering with $13,800. This is a slight concession from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profit. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still slightly lower than my initial goal, it's a fair price that allows me to make a profit while closing the deal.  Further negotiation might yield a higher price, but the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer or me having to sell to John for a lower price outweighs the potential gains."
