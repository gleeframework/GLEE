"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than the $150 John is offering, you can likely get a better deal from Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100 for the product. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $120, but still higher than the $80 value she places on it. This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation. It also leaves room for potential compromise if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is a good deal for me. It's lower than John's price of $150, and it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only lead to more rounds and potentially a higher price if Alice becomes less willing to budge.  While I could try for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John $150 outweighs the potential savings."
