Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging, hoping to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not making it a take-it-or-leave-it offer, leaving the door open for further negotiation.

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started and see how much Bob is willing to pay. I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting his offer would be a loss for me.  Therefore, I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value ($15,000). 
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm still willing to negotiate and find common ground.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between Bob's offer and my desired price. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price while keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the effort, I still believe that $12000 would be a fair price for both of us. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is persistent with his offer of $12,000, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better outcome.  Selling the product to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that could potentially result in a lower price."
