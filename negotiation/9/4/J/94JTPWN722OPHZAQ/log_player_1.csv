"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  I'm confident this price still represents a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $8,750. This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for your product. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll see if I can negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about we meet at $8,900?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $8,800? That's a great price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal. Let's finalize this now! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. It's better to secure a good price now rather than potentially get a lower offer in later rounds or have to sell to John for $10,000."
