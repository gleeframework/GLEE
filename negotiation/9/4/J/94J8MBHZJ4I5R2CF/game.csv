"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-demand item. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,300,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to split the difference. I'm offering $1,150,000 for the product. This price is closer to your value for the product, and it's within my budget. I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits us both.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,150,000. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you've placed on the product and the value I've placed on it. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to reach a price that works better for both of us. I'm offering $1,200,000. This price is fair considering the value to you, and it's within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen!",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,225,000. This price takes into account the value you've placed on the product and the value I've placed on it. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll need to consider other options.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
