Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):**  You have a strong BATNA because you can sell the product to John for $800,000. This gives you leverage.
* **Bob's Position:** The product's value to Bob is the same as your fallback price.  This means you need to incentivize him to buy from you instead of risking missing out.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still making the offer attractive enough that Bob won't want to risk losing the deal.

**Sample Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $875,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth and believe it's a deal that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive Tone:**  The message is straightforward and highlights the product's value.
* **Strong Opening Offer:** The $75,000 markup is significant but justifiable if you can back up the product's value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts"" implies a willingness to discuss the price further, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:**  Bob might counter-offer. Have a range in mind and be ready to justify your price.
* **Highlight Value:**  Emphasize the unique benefits Bob gains from this product to justify the higher price. 

By following this strategy, you maximize your chances of getting a price that reflects the product's true value while still ensuring a successful sale."
