Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the value this product will bring to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product for $675,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive.

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly signaling this is her bottom line.  While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk she walks away.  $675,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer, and it meets my goal of staying under $800,000."
