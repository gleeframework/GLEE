"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $700,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value it will bring to you. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a significant investment for me.  Would you be open to $650,000? I feel that would be a fair deal for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the value this product will bring to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product for $675,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive.",675000.0,Alice,5,
