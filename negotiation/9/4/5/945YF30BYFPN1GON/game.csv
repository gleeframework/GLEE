"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't proceed with a purchase at $15,000. Could we discuss a price closer to my budget, perhaps around $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter.  I understand your position, but $8,000 is just too low for me to consider. I could be flexible, but I need a price closer to my initial offer. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still feel that $13,000 is quite high for my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $11,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
