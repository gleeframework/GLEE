"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this work.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $850,000.  I'm still a bit stretched, but I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is my final offer, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,4,
