"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. This product has a lot of value that I think you'll appreciate in the long run. How about we settle at $12,000? ",12000.0,Alice,3,
