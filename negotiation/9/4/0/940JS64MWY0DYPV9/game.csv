"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be happy to buy it for $95.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $105? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $105 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $108. That's as low as I can go. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,5,
