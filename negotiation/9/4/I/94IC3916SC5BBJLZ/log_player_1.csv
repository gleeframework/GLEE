"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This is a strong opening offer. It's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will at least consider it given the value to him, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep the price within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is not terrible, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my target. I'll reject the offer and counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for you, given the product's value. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000 for the product. This brings us closer to my budget while still recognizing the value of the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to close the deal at this point. There's no need to risk further negotiations and potentially losing the deal."
