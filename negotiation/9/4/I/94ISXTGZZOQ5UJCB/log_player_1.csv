Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate you coming down to $12,000.  However, I'm looking to get a better price for the product.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. This is still a good deal for you as you value the product at $8,000, and it's significantly lower than the $15,000 I would pay elsewhere. What do you think?
