"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product is $15,000 to you. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate you coming down to $12,000.  However, I'm looking to get a better price for the product.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. This is still a good deal for you as you value the product at $8,000, and it's significantly lower than the $15,000 I would pay elsewhere. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,500 is still a little too high for me. Considering your valuation and my willingness to pay up to $15,000, I think $11,000 is a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen!",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you the product for $12,200. This is a fair price, taking into account your willingness to pay up to $15,000. I believe this is a good opportunity for us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $12,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my offer of $11,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.  Let's meet in the middle!",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum value of $12,000. I'll offer you the product for $12,100. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a better price. What do you think?",12100.0,Alice,7,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $12,100 is still above my target. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. It's closer to your minimum value and a much better price than I'd get elsewhere. Let's close this deal now!",11500.0,Bob,8,
