"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for your needs.  Given its value, I'm pricing it at $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a good home for the product, $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you do $17,000? I'm confident it's a fair price given its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

While $17,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your limit. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
