"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $175 is way over your $100 limit.  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

You're going to start with your maximum price, hoping to get a good deal. This is a bold move, but it might encourage Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $145 is closer to your limit, it's still above your ideal price. You can try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

You're offering a price in the middle of Alice's last offer and your limit. This shows you're willing to compromise while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You're still above your limit, but you're getting closer. You should try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

You're going to offer a price slightly higher than your previous counteroffer, but still lower than Alice's last offer. This shows that you are flexible and willing to meet halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

You're getting closer to your limit, and with only three rounds left, it's risky to keep rejecting offers. $130 is a good deal, considering your maximum is $100.  You might not get a better price, and you risk running out of time."
