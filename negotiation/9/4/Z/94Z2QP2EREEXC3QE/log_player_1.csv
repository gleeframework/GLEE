Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that price as possible while still making a profit. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $14,500.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a decent offer. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, I'm not too thrilled about selling it to him for $13,500. However, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer.

I'll try to get closer to my target price by offering Bob a price of $14,200. This is a compromise between his offer and my original price.
