"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I do see its value, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This reflects the value to me and allows for some profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and still allows for a good profit for me. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which is a good compromise considering the value to both of us. I'm confident this price allows you to make a good profit while remaining within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I'll sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
