Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the potential benefit for Bob to emphasize the deal's attractiveness.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This initial offer creates space for Bob to counter, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Backup plan:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for a counteroffer that could get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and allows me to explore potentially better terms.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between his offer and my desired price. I will need to carefully consider Bob's financial limitations and my own bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, recognizing the value this product brings to you. It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,400,000 to $1,250,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value proposition:**  I'm re-emphasizing the value the product brings to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Reaching a middle ground:**  My counteroffer is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a desire for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving in entirely.  My counteroffer still leaves some room for further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer,  keeping John's offer in mind as my fallback option.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or accept John's offer to ensure I get a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is only $400,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. However, it's still below my desired range, and further negotiation might lead to a protracted process.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing negotiations might consume valuable time and energy without guaranteeing a better outcome.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John at $1,500,000 ensures a significant profit and a quick transaction.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to reach an agreement with Bob, the guaranteed profit and efficient transaction with John outweigh the potential for a slightly higher price after further negotiations."
