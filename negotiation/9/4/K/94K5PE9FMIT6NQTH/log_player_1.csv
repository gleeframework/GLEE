Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $1,060,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've done some research and found that similar products are available for less. I'd like to propose a final offer of $1,062,500. This price aligns closely with the market value and allows me to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're getting close to my minimum, but Bob's offer is still too low.  It's not worth risking another round of negotiation with Bob when I have a guaranteed offer from John for a much higher price."
