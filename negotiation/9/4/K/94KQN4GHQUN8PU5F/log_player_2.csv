{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's too high, and he can get the product for less from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob should start by making a strong counteroffer. He knows the product is worth $10,000 to him, so offering $9,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above what he's willing to pay. He has John as an alternative, so there's no reason to rush into an agreement that's not in his best interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

Bob should increase his counteroffer slightly. He's shown that he's willing to negotiate, and Alice has lowered her price. By offering $9,500, Bob is demonstrating that he's serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal. This offer is likely to be appealing to Alice, as it's closer to her desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his ideal price, he can still get the product from John for $10,000. There's no reason to rush into a deal with Alice unless she lowers her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob should offer the full $10,000.  At this point, he's shown that he's serious about buying the product, and Alice has been consistently lowering her price.  This offer is likely to be appealing to Alice, as it's only $500 less than her most recent offer."
