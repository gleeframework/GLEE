"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to your business. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it is a compromise, it is still not a price Bob is willing to pay. It is still better to try and negotiate further."

I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a very fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business, and it will allow us both to walk away from this deal satisfied.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, the offer of $1,125,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget.  Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and it risks delaying the purchase."
