"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,250,000 is a little high. Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me at this time. Given the product's unique features and its potential value to your business, I'm confident it's worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This would still be a significant savings for you, while allowing me to get closer to the value I'm seeking.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,125,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
