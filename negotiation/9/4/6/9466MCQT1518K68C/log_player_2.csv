Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice is showing a willingness to compromise. While $475,000 isn't our ideal price, it's still a significant saving compared to John's offer and we've only got a few rounds left. Accepting this offer will secure the product and avoid the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a higher price or even a deal falling through."
