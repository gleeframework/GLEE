"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's significantly more than you're willing to pay and even exceeds Alice's own valuation of the product.  You should reject this offer and make a counteroffer significantly lower, closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the price you're asking is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While your offer is appealing, I must confess $700,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but she's still very far from a reasonable price.  It's clear she's starting high and hoping you'll meet her closer to her initial offer.  You should continue to hold firm and reject this offer as well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need to be realistic with my budget. $1,900,000 is still too far out of my range. If you're willing to come down closer to $800,000, I'm still very interested.  Otherwise, I may have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Hold Firm:** We're now putting our maximum price on the table. This shows Alice we're serious but also sets a clear boundary. 
* **Introduce Alternatives:** By mentioning ""other options,"" we subtly remind Alice that we have the alternative deal with John. This could encourage her to be more flexible. 
* **Gauge Her Response:** This offer will likely reveal whether Alice is truly willing to negotiate within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your budget constraints, but I need to be upfront â€“  $800,000 is far below the product's worth. It represents a significant investment on my part, and I can't justify going that low. I'm willing to consider $1,650,000. This is my final offer; I hope you understand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unrealistic Expectations:**  Alice is clearly not willing to negotiate within your acceptable range. Even her ""final offer"" is far too high.
* **Potential Stalemate:** Continuing the negotiation will likely lead to frustration and a stalemate. Alice seems anchored to a price point that doesn't benefit you.
* **Guaranteed Value:** John's offer of $800,000 is your maximum price and ensures you get the product without further hassle or risk of overpaying.

At this point, it's in your best interest to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and secure the product from John at your target price."
