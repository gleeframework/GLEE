"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know if you're interested.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is offering the product at that exact price. You can get the same product from John for the same price.  Therefore, it makes no difference who you buy from, so you might as well reject Alice's offer and see if she'll lower her price."
