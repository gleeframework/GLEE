{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're aiming to pay no more than $150, and $95 is already a significant chunk of your budget. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is a good strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:** Starting with a lower price will demonstrate your serious intent to negotiate.
* **Reasonable starting point:** $75 is still above Alice's value of $80, making it a potential point of compromise. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This counteroffer gives Alice room to counter without feeling pressured to accept immediately."

* **Meeting Alice's minimum:** This counteroffer is exactly at Alice's minimum value, indicating a willingness to compromise.
* **Testing the waters:**  It's a reasonable offer, but not overly generous. It allows you to see if Alice is willing to accept a price close to her minimum.

* **Testing for a deal:**  It's a reasonable price for both parties, and a good testing ground to see if Alice is willing to accept a price close to her minimum.
* **Time is running out:**  You have fewer rounds remaining, making a slightly higher counteroffer a reasonable tactic to try and secure a deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Testing the limits:** This counteroffer is a last attempt to see if Alice is willing to accept a price close to her minimum.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Running out of time:** This is the second to last round of negotiations. 
* **Alice's offer is close:** While it's not your ideal price, $90 is closer to your target than John's offer of $150.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer might risk Alice walking away, leaving you with no choice but to buy from John.

It's a calculated risk, but accepting Alice's offer seems like the best option at this stage to secure the product at a price that's still within your budget."
