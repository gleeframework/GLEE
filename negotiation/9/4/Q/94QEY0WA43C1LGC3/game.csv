"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I'm interested in the product, $9000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to consider $8500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8500. I'm willing to consider $9250, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this works for you.",9250.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about we split the difference and settle on $8875? This would be a fair deal for both of us and get this transaction moving.",8875.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,9000.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not quite ready to go as low as $8875. How about we meet at $9000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the sale moving.",9000.0,Alice,5,,
