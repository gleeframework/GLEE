I'm starting with a price a bit lower than my expected value, but still well above my minimum. This will hopefully encourage Bob to negotiate and hopefully lead to a win-win situation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful of getting a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
