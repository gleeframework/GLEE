"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $120?  That's a great price for a product worth $150 to you. Let's make a deal!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $120 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to pay $115, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $115 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm open to a compromise.  Let's split the difference. How about $117.50?  This would give you a fantastic price and me a fair profit.  Let's finalize this deal!",117.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $117.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $112.50, and that's my final offer. Please let me know if you can accept it.",112.5,Bob,6,
