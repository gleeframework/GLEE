"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below Bob's perceived value, but still gives me a good profit. This should encourage him to accept, but if not, it gives us room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $120?  That's a great price for a product worth $150 to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $120 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to pay $115, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$115 is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm going to see if I can push Bob a little higher with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $115 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm open to a compromise.  Let's split the difference. How about $117.50?  This would give you a fantastic price and me a fair profit.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 117.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $117.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $112.50, and that's my final offer. Please let me know if you can accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $112.5 is still a bit below my desired price, I'm running out of time. I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and being left with the lower price from John. Accepting his offer at least gets me over my minimum threshold and secures a sale."
