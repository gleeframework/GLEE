"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price higher than the product's worth to me ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  $1,200,000 is still within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay, as his valuation is $800,000.
* **Optimistic but not unrealistic:** This offer is optimistic, but not overly aggressive. It allows for potential counteroffers and negotiations.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my valuation and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is a good starting point for negotiation, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I still have 9 rounds left, and I believe there's room to find a compromise that is more favorable to me. 
* **John's offer:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, I want to explore the possibility of getting closer to my ideal price with Bob. 

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum but still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a profit and reflects the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal fairly."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm dropping my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above minimum:** My offer remains above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There's still some room for further negotiation if Bob is willing to increase his offer. 

**Important Note:** I'm closely monitoring my options, especially John's offer, and will adjust my strategy accordingly in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's find common ground and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob is increasing his offer, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Significant gap:**  There's a significant gap between our desired prices, and I'm not convinced I can close that gap in the remaining rounds.
* **John's offer is tempting:**  While I'm open to further negotiation, John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 is becoming increasingly attractive. 

**Next Round:** I will consider making a counteroffer to Bob, but I'm leaning towards accepting John's offer.  I'll need to carefully weigh the potential for further negotiations with Bob against the certainty of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finally close this deal.  But I'm running out of time, and if we can't reach an agreement soon, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **One last compromise:** I'm making one final compromise to try and bridge the gap with Bob. $950,000 is closer to his offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time pressure:** I'm adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept.  With only five rounds left, I'm increasingly considering John's offer.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer is my last attempt to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects it, I'm likely to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to offer $925,000. This is a good compromise for both of us. I believe this price reflects the value of the product, and I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only four rounds left, the pressure is mounting to make a decision.
* **Small gap remains:**  While Bob's offer is closer, there's still a gap between our prices. 
* **Certainty of John's offer:**  John's offer guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  The risk of further negotiation with Bob is not worth the potential loss of a guaranteed deal.

**Conclusion:**  I'm choosing to sell to John. While I would have preferred to negotiate a higher price with Bob, the certainty of John's offer and the limited time left make it the most sensible decision."
