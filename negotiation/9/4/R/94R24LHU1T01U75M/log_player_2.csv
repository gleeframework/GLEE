"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is an incredible deal, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.
