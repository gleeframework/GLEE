Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a price that works for both of us.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $975,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $975,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I could do $900,000.  That's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly signaling that $925,000 is her bottom line. Accepting this offer gets me the product for $75,000 less than John's price, which is a significant saving.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice away and forcing me to buy from John at the higher price."
