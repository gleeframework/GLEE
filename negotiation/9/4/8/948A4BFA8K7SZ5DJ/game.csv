"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet at a mutually beneficial price.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm surprised you're coming back to $11,000 after my last offer. I'm not willing to go back to that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is my last chance to get a good deal, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",12000.0,Alice,7,
