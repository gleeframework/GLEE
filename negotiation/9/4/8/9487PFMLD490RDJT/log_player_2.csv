"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's initial offer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a substantial discount.  $7000 is a bold move, but it signals Bob's seriousness about negotiation and sets the stage for a back-and-forth.  This aggressive approach could potentially lead to a faster deal or force Alice to reveal more about her desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum price, but it's still not a good deal. Bob has already shown he's willing to negotiate aggressively, and there are still rounds left.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and potentially leads to a better price in the future."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to Alice's offer but still trying to secure a lower price.  Offering $8,000 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a good deal.  This offer keeps the momentum going and puts pressure on Alice to either accept or come back with a counteroffer."
