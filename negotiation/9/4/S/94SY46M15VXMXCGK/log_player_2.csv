"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth to John.  You should reject this offer and counter with a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that starting price is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd need to see something closer to $10,000 to make this make sense."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's important to start strong in a negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  Offering $10,000 leaves space to potentially meet somewhere in the middle while still staying well below your $12,000 walk-away price.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind that John is a safety net. If Alice is completely unreasonable, you can always buy from him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but she's still trying to anchor the price relatively high. You're only $2,000 away from John's price, and you have plenty of rounds left to negotiate.  Another counteroffer is the best move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price.  However, $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Fair:** This counter-offer proposes a price exactly between your previous offer and Alice's current offer, making it clear you're willing to negotiate fairly.
* **Reaching Your Limit:** Offering $12,000 aligns with your maximum budget and the price John is offering.  
* **Pressure Point:**  Alice knows you have the option to go with John, so this counter-offer puts a bit of pressure on her to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** Alice is signaling that she's nearing her bottom line. However, you're only $1,000 away from your ideal price and John's offer. 
* **Leverage:** You still have several rounds and the backup option of John. This gives you leverage to push Alice a little further. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a slight risk Alice might walk away, but the potential reward of saving $1,000 is worth another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To be completely honest, I'm ready to buy this today, but only if we can agree on $12,000.  That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Respectful:** You're reiterating your firm stance on $12,000 while acknowledging her concessions and showing your eagerness to close the deal.
* **Deadline Implied:** By calling it your ""final offer"" you're subtly introducing a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.
* **Calculated Risk:**  There's a chance Alice might walk away, but you're standing your ground at a price that works for you, knowing you have John as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already met you at $13,000 and you rejected it. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make a new offer, but it will be a compromise. I'll meet you at $13,000, but I want a commitment from you to buy the product within the next 24 hours. If you're not ready to make a deal today, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is clearly unwilling to budge from $13,000. She's introduced a time pressure tactic, but that doesn't change your financial bottom line.
* **No Further Concessions:**  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a better result from Alice. She's signaled that $13,000 is her absolute limit.
* **John's Guarantee:**  You have a guaranteed option with John for $12,000.  It's not worth potentially wasting more time with Alice when you have a better deal secured."
