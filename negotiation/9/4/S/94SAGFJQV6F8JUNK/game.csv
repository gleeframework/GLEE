"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20000. It's a unique piece that I believe would be a valuable asset to you. Let me know your thoughts.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is the maximum I can spend. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $12000.  This price is still fair to me, and hopefully, it's within your budget.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10000 is closer, it's still a bit lower than what I can accept right now. I'm willing to come down to $11500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm still not quite there yet at $11500.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10750?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $10750 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I need to consider. How about we split the difference once more and settle on $11250?  This is a fair price that recognizes both of our needs.  Let's finalize this deal.",11250.0,Alice,7,
