{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a unique piece that I believe would be a valuable asset to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than your minimum value of $15,000. This allows room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to Bob. It opens the door for further discussion and allows for Bob to express interest or concerns. 

**Strategy:**

* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting high allows for more bargaining power and increases the potential profit margin.
* **Focus on Value:** The message highlights the product's potential value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message welcomes Bob's feedback, making the negotiation process seem more collaborative. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** Based on Bob's response, you'll need to adjust your strategy.  If he counteroffers, consider the offer and your fallback option of selling to John. 
* **Be prepared to counter-offer:** Be ready to make counteroffers, adjusting your price based on Bob's response and your goal of maximizing profit.
* **Don't be afraid to walk away:**  If Bob's offers are too low or the negotiations stall, remember that you can always sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is the maximum I can spend. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Loss Prevention:**  Selling for $8,000 would be a major loss compared to my minimum value and the potential for a higher price with further negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While Bob's offer is low, he has shown interest in the product.  There's potential to negotiate a higher price by rejecting his initial counteroffer and making a counteroffer myself.
* **Fallback Option:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value or potentially a price within a range that might still be acceptable to Bob. 
* **Assess Bob's Response:** I will carefully consider Bob's response to my counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  
* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** If negotiations with Bob stall or his offers remain too low, I will not hesitate to sell to John for $15,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This price is still fair to me, and hopefully, it's within your budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  This offer is $4,000 higher than Bob's offer, which is significantly closer to my minimum value of $15,000.

* **Reasonable Adjustment:**  I've made a significant adjustment from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable margin.

* **Prepared for Further Negotiation:**  I am prepared to make further adjustments based on Bob's response, while still keeping my minimum value in mind.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:** Carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I've achieved a profitable sale. If he rejects, I'll need to make another counteroffer or consider selling to John.
* **Adjust Strategy:**  Based on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly. If he seems hesitant, I may need to lower my price slightly. If he seems unwilling to budge, I'll need to decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and there's potential to secure a higher price. 
* **Fallback Option:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000, providing a safety net for my minimum desired profit. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $15,000 or potentially within a range that is more appealing to Bob.  I'll likely offer something between $11,000 and $13,000, aiming for a compromise. 
* **Assess Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
