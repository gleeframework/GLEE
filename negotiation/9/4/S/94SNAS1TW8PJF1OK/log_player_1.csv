Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By initially offering the product at $18,000, Alice anchors the negotiation at a higher point than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning another interested buyer (John) creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
* **Justifying the Price:** While not explicitly stating her minimum, Alice implies the product's value justifies the higher price.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** Alice gets a great deal at $18,000.
* **Bob negotiates:** This opens the door for Alice to potentially meet somewhere in the middle, still exceeding her minimum.
* **Bob rejects:** Alice can then sell to John for her guaranteed $15,000. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with some risk and the potential for Bob to walk away."
