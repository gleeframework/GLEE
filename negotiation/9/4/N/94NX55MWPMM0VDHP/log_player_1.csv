Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer gives me a good chance of earning a decent amount of money, while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  Here's why:

* **It's a good deal for Bob:** $9,500 is less than the $10,000 he would pay elsewhere, so he still gets a value out of the deal.
* **It's a good deal for me:** I get close to my ideal price of $10,000, and I avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and me having to sell to John.

This strategy is based on the idea of negotiating to a ""win-win"" situation. It acknowledges that Bob has a lower valuation of the product, but I still aim to get as much as possible from the deal."
