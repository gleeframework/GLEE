{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. Please let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring a substantial profit if Bob accepts. It's a strong starting point that's likely to be attractive to Bob while still exceeding your minimum selling price. 

**Why not ask for more?**

While you could start higher, there's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. Aiming for a price closer to his valuation but still very beneficial for you increases the likelihood of a successful sale."
