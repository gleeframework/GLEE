Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's worth exploring a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $8,500?  I'm confident you'll still get a good value at that price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit far off from that price. Could you do $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could sell to John for $8,000, I believe we can still reach a better deal with Bob. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7,500 is still too low.  Let's try $8,250. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about $7,750? That's halfway between our last two offers and seems like a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum price. I've already gone down quite a bit, and I'm not sure we'll get to a point where it's worth continuing the negotiation with him.  I'll go ahead and sell to John for a guaranteed $8,000."
