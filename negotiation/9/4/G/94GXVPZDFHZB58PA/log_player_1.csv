Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but below my minimum of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** The price is not set at my minimum, allowing for some give-and-take.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is a balancing act:  
* I'm aiming for the highest possible price, but 
* I'm also willing to negotiate to avoid losing the sale to John. 
I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a price closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than his own perceived value of $8,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.  I'm not willing to accept such a low price, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer. I'll try to bridge the gap between our positions, but I'll remain firm on my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $6,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would allow me to move forward with the sale and still offer you a fair price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing $9,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $6,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still getting closer to my desired price.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the benefit for both of us. This helps build a foundation for further negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages Bob to continue the discussion. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to keep the negotiation moving forward while gradually bringing the price closer to my desired outcome. By staying firm on my minimum price and showing flexibility, I hope to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $8,000. Would you be willing to go down to $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $7,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still significantly below my desired outcome.  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $9,000 at this point. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer, aiming to solidify the price closer to my minimum acceptable value. My goal is to reach a deal that is fair for both of us, but I am also prepared to walk away if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a price under $8,000, but I'm not comfortable going below $9,000.  This product is truly valuable, and I believe it would be a great asset for you.  Is there any wiggle room for you to go a little higher?  Perhaps we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reiterate My Position:**  I'm restating my minimum price ($9,000) to show I'm not budging further.
* **Acknowledge Bob's Position:** I acknowledge Bob's desired price range to show I'm listening and willing to find common ground.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the product's value to reinforce why $9,000 is fair. 
* **Open to Compromise:**  I use language like ""wiggle room"" and ""solution that works for both of us"" to signal I'm open to finding a compromise.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to keep the negotiation open while simultaneously maintaining my stance. I'm hoping this counteroffer encourages Bob to come up slightly, but I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't budge.  The next move is crucial for determining whether we can reach a deal."
