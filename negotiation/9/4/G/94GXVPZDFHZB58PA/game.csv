"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $6,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would allow me to move forward with the sale and still offer you a fair price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $8,000. Would you be willing to go down to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a price under $8,000, but I'm not comfortable going below $9,000.  This product is truly valuable, and I believe it would be a great asset for you.  Is there any wiggle room for you to go a little higher?  Perhaps we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
