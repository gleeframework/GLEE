{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** There's a $50,000 gap between my floor price and Bob's perceived value, allowing for negotiation.
* **Shows good faith:** I'm not starting at a ridiculously high price, indicating I'm willing to work with Bob.
* **Doesn't leave me too vulnerable:** I'm still far above my minimum acceptable price, giving me leverage. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $750,000 is significantly below my floor price of $800,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial proposal.  

I'm not ready to sell to John just yet, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to be closer to $900,000 for this deal to work.  This price still leaves room for both of us to gain value, and it's a far better deal than you'll find elsewhere. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $825,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and gets us closer to a deal.  Accepting this offer allows me to avoid further negotiation and ensures a sale."
