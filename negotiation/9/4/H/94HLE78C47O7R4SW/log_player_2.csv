"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth $10,000. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $10,000 is better than John's price, Bob wants to save as much money as possible. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation as Alice values the product at $8,000 and Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000. 
* **Round 1:** It's too early to buy from John. Bob should try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for the product. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** $9,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Within budget:** It's still within Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer gauges Alice's willingness to negotiate and provides a starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our previous discussions, I propose we aim for a middle ground. How about $9,500 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has come down from her initial price, $9,500 is still above what Bob is ideally aiming for. 
* **Further negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation since Alice is willing to go lower than her initial offer.
* **Not a desperate situation:** It's only round 3, and Bob has time to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land a bit lower.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $9,250.  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight compromise:** This offer shows Bob is willing to negotiate but still pushing for a better price. 
* **Fair middle ground:** $9,250 is a reasonable middle ground between Bob's previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's current offer of $9,500.
* **Clear intention:** Bob is expressing his willingness to finalize the deal at this price, putting pressure on Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your proposal of $9,250. To continue moving forward, I suggest we consider $9,375 as a fair price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  $9,375 is very close to Bob's ideal price range, and significantly lower than John's offer.
* **Limited rounds:**  We're already in round 5, so there's less room for further negotiation.
* **Risk of losing out:**  If Bob keeps rejecting, Alice may become less willing to negotiate, or he might run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 

By accepting this offer, Bob secures a good deal while minimizing the risk of a stalemate."
