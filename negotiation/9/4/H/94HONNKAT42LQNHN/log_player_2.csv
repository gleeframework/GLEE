"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm confident you'll be interested in making a deal. My initial offer for the product is $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000).  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't justify paying more than $850,000. Let's start there and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so my counteroffer is $1050000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should continue to negotiate and attempt to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I think $950000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1050000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between that and your last offer, so I'll meet you at $1000000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer to $1,000,000, it is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to push for a lower price. There are still rounds left, and a deal is possible at a price closer to Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,000,000.  That's getting closer, but I'm still not there.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I think I can meet you halfway between $1000000 and $900000, so I'll offer you $950000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $950,000, Bob still has room to negotiate.  He is still within his budget, and with only three rounds left, it's worth trying to push for a lower price.  Bob should counteroffer with a price closer to his target of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000.  Let's try to close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I can meet you halfway between $950000 and $925000, so I'll offer you $937500. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiations with Alice. Even though Alice has lowered the price to $937,500, it is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's unlikely that Alice will come down to Bob's desired price in the final round. To ensure a successful purchase within his budget, Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000."
