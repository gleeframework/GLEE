"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm confident you'll be interested in making a deal. My initial offer for the product is $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't justify paying more than $850000. Let's start there and see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so my counteroffer is $1050000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I think $950000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1050000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between that and your last offer, so I'll meet you at $1000000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1000000.  That's getting closer, but I'm still not there.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I think I can meet you halfway between $1000000 and $900000, so I'll offer you $950000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",950000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $950000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $925000.  Let's try to close this deal at this price.",925000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I can meet you halfway between $950000 and $925000, so I'll offer you $937500. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",937500.0,Alice,9,
