"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm happy to discuss further, but I'd like to start with an offer of $1,050,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, the value this product offers is truly significant, and I believe my initial offer reflects that fairly. To move things along, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  This feels like a strong compromise. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,120,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $1,080,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while also staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation. While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, there's room for more negotiation before accepting an offer below $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to engage in this negotiation. I've considered your latest offer, and I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair and attractive price for a product of this caliber.  Does this work for you?"",
""product_price"": 1100000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my ideal range. I'm ready to close the deal, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,090,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has steadily increased his offer and is now at $1,090,000. While we could potentially push for a bit more in the remaining rounds, the difference is becoming smaller and there's a risk Bob could walk away. Accepting this offer secures a strong profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
