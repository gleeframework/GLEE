"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always best to try and negotiate a lower price, especially when you have a backup option (John).  Rejecting the first offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm happy to discuss further, but I'd like to start with an offer of $1,050,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, the value this product offers is truly significant, and I believe my initial offer reflects that fairly. To move things along, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  This feels like a strong compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower, it's still higher than your ideal price. Since you have the option to buy from John, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,120,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $1,080,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while also staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to engage in this negotiation. I've considered your latest offer, and I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair and attractive price for a product of this caliber.  Does this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has come down to $1,100,000 which is still above your ideal price.  Keep negotiating, you have more rounds left, and you can always go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my ideal range. I'm ready to close the deal, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,090,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1090000}
