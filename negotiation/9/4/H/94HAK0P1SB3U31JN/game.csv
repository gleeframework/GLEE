"I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,475,000? This would still be a significant deal for you, and it gets us closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1475000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,475,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it brings us closer to an agreement.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,425,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,325,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can agree on a price.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
