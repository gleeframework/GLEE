"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it clear that I'm aiming for a good price.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $1,750,000 is still within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay, as it's closer to his valuation than my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that Bob will counteroffer, and we can then negotiate from there. If he doesn't, I have the option of going to John and getting my minimum price.  This approach balances the need to maximize profit with the risk of losing a potential buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob has shown interest, and by rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. This encourages further negotiation.
* **Value of Time:** With 9 rounds remaining, I have time to potentially reach a more favorable price.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range. This will test his willingness to pay and allow me to gauge his real budget. If he doesn't budge, I'll have to decide whether to accept his offer, counteroffer again, or go with John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,475,000? This would still be a significant deal for you, and it gets us closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1475000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. This shows that I'm serious about closing the deal but not willing to concede too much.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll receive, emphasizing that $1,475,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone remains positive and invites further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move to see if Bob is willing to budge further. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to assess whether to accept his offer, counteroffer again, or go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,475,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $1,350,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate, so it's worth continuing to try and get a better price.
* **Time is on my side:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I still have time to explore options and potentially get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my minimum.  I'll aim for a price that bridges the gap between our current offers while still keeping in mind my goal of getting as close to $1,500,000 as possible. This counteroffer will test Bob's commitment to the deal and gauge his potential for further compromise. If he doesn't budge, I'll have to decide whether to accept his offer, counteroffer again, or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it brings us closer to an agreement.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This offer is a compromise, closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Focus on Fair Value:** I emphasize that the price is fair and reflects the product's worth. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm remaining positive and encouraging to keep the negotiation going.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move to see if Bob is willing to budge just a little more. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to assess whether to accept his offer, counteroffer again, or go with John. It's getting close to the point where selling to John might be the more secure option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,425,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,325,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We are in round 6, and Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum.
* **Risk of getting stuck:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk of getting stuck in a stalemate and losing time. 
* **Guaranteed price with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the risk of continuing with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower offer or no deal is too high.  Selling to John ensures I get my desired value and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
