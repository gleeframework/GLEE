"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000, which is a fair price considering its worth to me. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Would you consider selling the product for $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the potential benefits it can bring to your business.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose a price closer to what I believe is fair. How about $1025000 for the product?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're still looking for a bit more wiggle room, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1025000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm going to counteroffer at $1075000 again, but I'll throw in a small concession - I'll give you a 2% discount, so the price would be $1060500. This is my final offer on the higher end, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1060500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm not ready to give up on getting closer to my target price. I'll make a slightly higher offer, $1075000, and throw in a small sweetener - I'll include a 1-year warranty and dedicated support for the product. This is my last chance to get closer to my desired price, so I hope you'll consider it.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
