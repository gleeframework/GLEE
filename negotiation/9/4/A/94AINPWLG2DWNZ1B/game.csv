"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? This gives us both a good deal and moves us closer to an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway between $9,000 and $9,500? That would put the price at $9,250. I'm willing to pay that much for the product.",9250.0,Bob,4,
