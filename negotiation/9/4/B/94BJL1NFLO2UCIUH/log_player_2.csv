Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a lower price, but I believe you'll get the most value from this product. My best offer is $12,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is signaling that she has other offers and is willing to accept a lower price, but this might be her final push.  Getting the product for $12,000 is a good deal, and trying to push further might result in losing the opportunity."
