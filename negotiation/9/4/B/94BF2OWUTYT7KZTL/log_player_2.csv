(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. $1,200,000 is still above Alice's value, so there's room for a better deal."

$1,300,000 is still higher than Alice's value, so there is still room for a lower price. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."
