"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and your desired price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective values.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,225,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, while also being reasonable for me. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm close to my target price, but $1,225,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to offer you $1,200,000, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
