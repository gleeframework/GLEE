"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. I'm confident that the product's value to me is closer to $800000. Can you meet me halfway and consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your offer. I'll counteroffer at $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'll need to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me, and I'm hoping you can consider it.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're still trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll counteroffer at $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm not willing to stretch it further. I'll make one more counteroffer: $780000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me, and I'm hoping you can consider it.",780000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $780000. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to make any more. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $800000, and I think it's time to consider that option. I'll give you one final chance to meet me at $800000. If not, I'll have to consider selling it to John.",800000.0,Alice,7,
