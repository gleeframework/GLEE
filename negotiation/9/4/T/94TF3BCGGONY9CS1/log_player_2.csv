"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great deal.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try negotiating a lower price that's closer to our $120 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that's a bit steep for my budget.  Could you do $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it starts the negotiation with room to work up to a price that might be acceptable to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for the interest! While $100 is a bit low for me, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $125, which is close enough to our $120 limit. It's not worth risking losing the deal by pushing for a lower price and potentially having to buy from John at $120 anyway."
