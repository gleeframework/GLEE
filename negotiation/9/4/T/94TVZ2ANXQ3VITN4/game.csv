"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my value for the product and allows for a good profit for you as well.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant and goes beyond its immediate price point. I could consider letting it go for $1,100,000. This offer takes into account the value it offers but still allows me a fair return.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This price is still a good profit for you considering my maximum budget and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
