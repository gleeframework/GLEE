"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $18,000. It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $15,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay close to the original price, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,500. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to him. There's room for negotiation, so it's better to reject and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still looking to get as close to my budget as possible.  How about $16,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $16,250, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $16,250 is still above Bob's ideal price point, but it's getting closer.  Since there are only 5 rounds remaining, it's a good time to accept the offer.  Trying to negotiate further may risk losing the deal, and at $16,250, Bob is still saving money compared to buying from John."
