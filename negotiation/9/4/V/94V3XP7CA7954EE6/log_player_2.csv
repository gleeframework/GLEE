Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I see we're close!  $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. Let's meet in the middle.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I still need to make a reasonable profit. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,200,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're definitely getting closer!  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price.  Would you consider $1,195,000? It's a small step from your last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,195,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,195,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $1,195,000 is a good price. It's unlikely you'll get a significantly better deal in the remaining rounds, and there's always the risk Alice could become less flexible. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at the higher price."
