"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.",850000.0,Alice,5,
