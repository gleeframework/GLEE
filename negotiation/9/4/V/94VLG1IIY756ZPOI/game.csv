"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm willing to negotiate, $13500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $14250?  This price is fair and reflects the product's value.",14250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $14250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $13750? This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",13750.0,Bob,4,
