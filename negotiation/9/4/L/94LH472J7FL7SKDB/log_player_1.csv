{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **High Anchor:** This initial price sets a high anchor point, making it more likely Bob will accept a slightly lower price if he decides to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so I'm not desperate and can afford to aim high with Bob."
