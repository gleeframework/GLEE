"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I can see you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I still need to get the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is the same price I offered initially. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",11000.0,Alice,5,
