"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this product from me. I think it's a fantastic item that would be a great addition to your collection. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1,280,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,280,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm firm on $1,260,000. Let's make this happen!",1260000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,260,000 and $1,300,000. How about we try $1,280,000 again? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,5,
