"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $15,000 is still too high for my budget. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a fair price here. $9,500 is still quite low. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $12,250 is still pushing my budget. I can offer $10,000, my final price.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
