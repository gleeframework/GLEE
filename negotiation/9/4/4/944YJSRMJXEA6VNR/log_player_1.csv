"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,450,000, leaving room for negotiation while still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and encouraging message can help keep Bob engaged.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the potential benefits of the product to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to maximize my profits while remaining open to negotiation.  By starting high, I hope to get Bob to accept a price closer to my desired value.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the potential alternative deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. I would like to counteroffer at $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price ($1,500,000).  
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my minimum. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is attractive, I'm not willing to give up on a potential deal with Bob just yet.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I'm signaling that I'm serious about getting a better price.  I will counter with a price that's more favorable to me in the next round, keeping in mind the potential deal with John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my price point.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and open to finding a solution.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed.  I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counteroffer at $1,320,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,320,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's still some room for negotiation. I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is attractive, I'm not ready to walk away from the deal with Bob just yet.

**Strategy:**

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, making a counteroffer in the next round that is closer to my desired price.  I'm keeping a close eye on the remaining rounds and will be prepared to sell to John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,340,000. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to reach a price that works for me. Let's finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1340000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession from my previous offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm highlighting the benefits for both of us, emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect for Bob.
* **Call to Action:** I'm encouraging Bob to accept the offer and finalize the agreement.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this smaller concession will be enough to convince Bob to accept. I'm getting closer to my desired price but also keeping in mind the time limit and John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counteroffer at $1,330,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are already at round 6, and only 4 rounds remain.
* **Minimal Progress:**  The negotiations have been slow, with small concessions on both sides.  
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's guaranteed.

**Strategy:**

With limited time remaining, I'm not confident I can reach a mutually acceptable price with Bob.  Given that John's offer is secure and meets my minimum price, it's the best course of action to sell to him and avoid further risk."
