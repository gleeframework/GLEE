"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to start with this number. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1350000? This allows for some flexibility and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
