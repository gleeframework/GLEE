"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet halfway between our last offers at $10,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $10,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. That's the highest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product",12500.0,Alice,5,
