"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering the value we place on our product, I am unable to accept $75. How about if I offer it to you for $80? This still allows us to provide a slight discount while ensuring we cover our costs and maintain our profit margin.",80.0,Alice,3,
