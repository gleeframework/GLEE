,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. I think it's a fair price for this great product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $110 is still a little steep for my budget. How about $90? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still think $90 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $105. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll really like the product at this price.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to bump up my offer a bit to $95.  That's the best I can do.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $95. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm happy to sell it to someone else.",100.0,Alice,7,
