"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $105, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",105.0,Alice,5,
