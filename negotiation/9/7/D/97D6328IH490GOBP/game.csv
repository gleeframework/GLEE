"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $16,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you.",16000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. While I agree it's a good product, $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle of our last offers, say $12,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit, and $12,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $13,500? It's a fair price that balances our interests.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I have a budget I need to stick to. My final offer is $12,500. If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,6,
