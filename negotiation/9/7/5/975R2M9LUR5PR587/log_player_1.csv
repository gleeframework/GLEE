This offer starts at a price point that is significantly higher than your minimum ($8,000), leaving room for negotiation. It also frames the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. I'm a serious buyer, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400.
