"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $8500? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer. How about we settle on $7000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8200? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $8200 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $7000, but I need to be honest with you, this is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",7000.0,Bob,6,
