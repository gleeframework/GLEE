"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a fair compromise. This price still leaves room for your profit, and I believe we can both walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $850,000 is still outside my price range.

I'm confident this price allows for both of us to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 825000}
