Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you think the price is a bit high, but I believe the product's value is worth more than that.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

This is my final concession, so I hope we can agree on a price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has signaled this is her final concession. Accepting at $925,000 provides a $275,000 savings compared to John's offer.  Continuing the negotiation has diminishing returns and risks ending up with a worse outcome if Alice holds firm."
