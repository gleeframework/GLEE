```

**Explanation:**

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $91 is very close to my ideal price.  With only three rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  There is a chance I might be able to get a lower price, but it's also possible that Alice will become more stubborn and the deal will fall apart.  Buying at $91 is a good deal and allows me to secure the product."
