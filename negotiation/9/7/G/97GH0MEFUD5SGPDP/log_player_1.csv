Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find really valuable.  I'm asking for $110 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me.  This gives me some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $95. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than nothing, I'm still willing to hold out for a bit more. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $100 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum."
