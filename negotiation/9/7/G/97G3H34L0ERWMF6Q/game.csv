"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested, but I'd be comfortable paying $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  I'm happy to pay $108. That's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $109? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finally close this deal.",109.0,Alice,5,
