"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, aiming to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential earnings. I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested, but I'd be comfortable paying $105.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm confident that I can get a better deal through further negotiation, especially since Bob has expressed interest. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $110, which is closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm also reiterating the value of the product and emphasizing the fairness of my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  I'm happy to pay $108. That's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $108 is still below my target.  I believe I can push for a slightly higher price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $109? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 109}
```

I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's current offer.  I'm also emphasizing the finality of this offer to encourage Bob to accept."
