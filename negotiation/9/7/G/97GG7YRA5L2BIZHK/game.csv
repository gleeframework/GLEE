"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $12000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $13000, which is a significant discount from my original price. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to try to meet in the middle again. How about $11000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to compromise again, though. How about $12500? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to me.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I've already looked into alternative options, and I can get the product from John for $10000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time. How about $11500? This is the absolute highest I'm willing to go.",11500.0,Bob,6,
