"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my maximum budget is $800,000, I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I place on it and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I still believe the product's value is higher than that. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This price still reflects the product's worth, but also shows my willingness to compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still outside of my comfort zone.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
