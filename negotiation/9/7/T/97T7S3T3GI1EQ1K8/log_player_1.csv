"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation. This should encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually beneficial price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000).  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $9,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's below his perceived value, and it's a compromise from my initial offer.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price ($8,000). I'm going to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm not yet desperate enough to settle for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $8,900. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but still above my minimum price. It's also a good price for Bob, as it's lower than his perceived value. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept the offer."
