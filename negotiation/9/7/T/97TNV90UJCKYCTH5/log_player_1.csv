Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm asking for $1,600,000. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** By offering the product significantly above Bob's perceived value, you gauge his eagerness and potential to pay a premium. 
* **Justification:** The message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high. This allows Bob to either accept the perceived value or initiate a negotiation where you can highlight the product's benefits.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, a very high initial offer might discourage Bob from negotiating altogether.  It's a calculated risk."
