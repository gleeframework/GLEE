Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** While $175 is more than Bob wants to pay, it might be tempting enough if the product is something he wants. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob (e.g., is he price-sensitive?), you might choose a different opening price."
