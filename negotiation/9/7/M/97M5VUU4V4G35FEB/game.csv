"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1200000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my own value for the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $900000 is a bit below your target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1050000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $950000, which is $1000000. I'll sell it to you for $1000000, and we can call it a day.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
