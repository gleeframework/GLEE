"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $750,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still willing to work with you, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $725,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is important to you and I respect your position.  How about this: I'm willing to do $710,000. That's a firm offer from me, and I think it's a fair compromise.  If that doesn't work, I'll need to consider my other options.",710000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $710,000. I'm willing to meet you at $720,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's worth noting that I have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay the full $1,200,000. If we can't come to an agreement, I may need to consider selling to him.",720000.0,Alice,7,
