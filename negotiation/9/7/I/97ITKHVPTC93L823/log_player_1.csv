Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good return.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on Value:**  My message highlights that the product is ""fantastic"" which subtly emphasizes its worth. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response and decide how to proceed based on his actions:

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good sale.
* **Counteroffer:**  If Bob counters, I'll analyze his offer and decide whether to accept, counter with a lower price, or walk away and sell to John. 
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects without a counteroffer, I'll move on and sell to John to avoid losing time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a deal, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I want to make a deal, accepting his offer would be a substantial loss.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit lower than I can go right now, I'm willing to come down to $140 to see if we can make this work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm giving a brief explanation for the price (""I can go right now""), making it seem like a fair and reasonable offer. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going.

**Next Steps:**

I will wait for Bob's response and decide how to proceed based on his actions:

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, great!  I've secured a good price.
* **Counteroffer:** If Bob counters again, I will evaluate the offer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or walk away and sell to John.
* **Rejection:**  If Bob rejects without a counteroffer, I'll proceed to sell to John to avoid losing further time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob has come up to $130, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's getting closer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I'd prefer to get closer to $150, I'm considering the following:
    * **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  Bob might reject another counteroffer, leading to more back-and-forth and potential wasted time.
    * **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale, avoiding the risk of him walking away or me having to sell to John at a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer, secure the sale, and move on to other opportunities."
