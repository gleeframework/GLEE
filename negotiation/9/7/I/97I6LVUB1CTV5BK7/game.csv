"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I agree it's a good product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $1,050,000? That's a firm offer from me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $1,080,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.
