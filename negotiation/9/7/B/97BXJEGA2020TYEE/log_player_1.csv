Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $975,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise that balances the value of the product with my budget.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is consistently meeting in the middle, but we're still significantly above his perceived value of $800,000. There's a chance to push him a bit further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but we need to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This offer takes into account the value it brings and offers you a significant return on your investment. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close to the point where continuing to push Bob risks him walking away.  This offer is a strong compromise â€“ still well above his valuation, but gives him a final chance to get the product at a price that might be palatable.  By stating it's our final offer, we add a bit of pressure for him to accept."

Round 8

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is anchored at $975,000 and unlikely to budge significantly.  We've reached the point of diminishing returns. Accepting his offer nets us less than John is offering, and further negotiation has a high risk of failure.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
