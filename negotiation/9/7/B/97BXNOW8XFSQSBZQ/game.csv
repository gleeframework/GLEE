"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price given my budget and the product's value. Let's see if we can find a deal at this level.",9500.0,Bob,4,
