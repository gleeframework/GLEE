"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,500. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price given my budget and the product's value. Let's see if we can find a deal at this level. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear that we are unlikely to reach a price that significantly exceeds John's offer of $10,000.  The time and effort spent on further negotiation with Bob might not result in a worthwhile gain. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and avoids potential further haggling."
