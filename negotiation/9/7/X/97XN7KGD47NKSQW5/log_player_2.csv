"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price! I'm willing to let you have it for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $180 is far above your $120 limit and even above her own product valuation. John offers the product for $120, which meets your maximum price.  Therefore, it makes the most sense to buy from John."
