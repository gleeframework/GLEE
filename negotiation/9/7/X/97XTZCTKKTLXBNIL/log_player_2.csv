"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While Alice's offer is within his budget, there's no indication that it's a good deal. It's worth exploring if a lower price is possible through negotiation before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend $10000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is still higher than Bob's desired price of $10,000. However, it's closer to his budget. It's worth negotiating further to try and get a price closer to $10,000, especially since Bob can always buy from John for $15,000 if negotiations fail."
