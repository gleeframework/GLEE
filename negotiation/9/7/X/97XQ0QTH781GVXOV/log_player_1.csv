Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000.  This is a good starting point because:

* **It's ambitious:** I want to maximize my potential profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** I can lower the price if necessary without going below my minimum value.
* **It signals my confidence in the product's worth:**  A high initial offer demonstrates that I believe the product is valuable.

I'll be ready to analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to accept it right away. Here's why:

* **Negotiation is a process:** Accepting immediately signals that I was willing to settle for much less, potentially undermining my bargaining power in future negotiations.
* **I might be able to get more:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if he truly wants the product. By rejecting his initial offer, I can explore that possibility.

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my original asking price, leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows I'm not desperate to accept his price immediately.
* **It's closer to my initial asking price:** This suggests I'm still confident in the value of the product.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to meet me halfway. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still protecting my interests. I'll be ready to analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Here's why:

* **We're getting closer:** Bob is increasing his offer, which indicates he's genuinely interested in the product. 
* **I can still potentially get more:**  I'm only $100,000 away from my desired price point. I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **Selling to John would be a loss:** While John offers $800,000, I'm not going to settle for a lower price if there's a chance I can get closer to my original goal. 

I'll counteroffer again with a price closer to $900,000. I want to see if I can push Bob a little further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000.  This is a strong but reasonable offer:

* **It's a significant increase from Bob's offer:** I'm showing that I'm not willing to settle for much less than my initial asking price.
* **It's still a potential compromise:** I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, indicating that I want to make a deal.
* **It leaves room for one last counteroffer:** If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to increase his offer just a bit more.

I'm confident that this counteroffer will either lead to a deal or convince Bob to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiation has reached a stalemate.  Bob's offer of $825,000 is only $25,000 higher than John's offer, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation for such a small gain. It's time to cut my losses and secure the sale with John. 

While I'm not thrilled about accepting John's offer, it's the best course of action given the circumstances. I've learned a valuable lesson about the importance of setting realistic expectations and recognizing when to walk away from a negotiation."
