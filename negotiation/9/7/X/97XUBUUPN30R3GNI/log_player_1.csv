{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price increases my chances of a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $140 is still a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($100) but is attractive enough to potentially entice him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a slightly higher final price."
