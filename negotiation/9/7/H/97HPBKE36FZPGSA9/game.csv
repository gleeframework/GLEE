"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to agree on a price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but only this once. I'll offer the product for $1,050,000. It's a fair price, and it allows us to both walk away with something. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
