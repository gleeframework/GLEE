"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  This product is worth $12,000 to me, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his target of $10,500. While Alice's offer of $11,000 is better than John's $12,000, there's still room for improvement. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price he's more comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Let's split the difference and go with $10,750. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $10,900. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is very close to Bob's target of $10,500 and a much better deal than buying from John for $12,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't budge much lower. Accepting the offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
