I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit above my minimum. I believe this is a strong starting point, but I'm prepared to adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I believe I can still secure a higher price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but higher than his. This will allow us to continue negotiating and hopefully reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. However, it's still higher than Bob's offer, leaving space for further negotiation.  I'm hoping this move encourages Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge from his initial offer.  While I'd like to secure a higher price, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale altogether.  It's time to move on and accept John's offer to guarantee a sale at my minimum price."
