"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her initial asking price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  By rejecting, he can make a counteroffer and try to push the price closer to his $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to be aggressive, but still reasonable. He's offering $10,500, which is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and halfway between her price and his desired price. This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but isn't willing to overpay. It's a good starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While $11,500 is still above his ideal, it's only $1,500 over his limit.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether, and John's offer is a solid backup.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $11,500 is a good compromise that saves Bob some money."
