"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate! Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to haggle before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Direct:** I want to maintain a positive tone while being clear about my budget constraints. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is above Alice's value ($80) but well below my maximum and John's offer. It will be interesting to see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $70 is too low for me.  Could you do $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we can still try to push a bit further. $85 is getting close to John's price, but there's still room to negotiate before considering that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $70 was probably a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $78?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer suggests a compromise and shows willingness to move closer to Alice's price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $78 is still below both Alice's asking price and John's offer, giving us some bargaining power. It's also a price that would save me a significant amount compared to the original offer or buying from John. 
* **Time Consideration:** While I could keep negotiating, further back-and-forth might not yield much more benefit. I'm aiming to secure a good deal without dragging the negotiation on too long."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob! I could come down to $82, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $82 is a solid price for the product. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and John's price. 
* **Final Offer:** Alice has indicated this is her best price.  Trying to negotiate further might risk losing the deal.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield significant savings, and it's generally best to finalize a reasonable deal promptly."
