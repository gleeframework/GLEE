Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit significantly above my minimum.  I'll assess Bob's counteroffer and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I will counter with a higher offer, hoping to find a compromise closer to my target."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee of a higher offer, and I risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at my minimum, securing a profitable transaction."
