"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,000. That's the maximum I can afford, and I hope you can work with me on this.",8000.0,Bob,4,
