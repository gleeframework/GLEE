"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the initial price of $14,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market.",11000.0,Bob,4,
