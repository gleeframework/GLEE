Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think you'll find it valuable."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you should aim for a price higher than that with Bob. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  While you could aim for a much higher price, starting at $95 gives Bob a perceived ""deal"" (it's lower than your guaranteed sale price) while still netting you a good profit.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price if he's hesitant, but still within a range profitable for you."
