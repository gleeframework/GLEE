Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is better than his initial offer, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
