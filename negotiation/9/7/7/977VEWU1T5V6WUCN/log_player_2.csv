"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many of our customers. It's worth more than $80 to us, but I'm willing to start our negotiation at $95. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than my maximum value of $120. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
