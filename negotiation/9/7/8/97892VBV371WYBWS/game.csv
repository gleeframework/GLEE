"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm not able to pay $1,200,000 for it. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about $1,100,000? It's still a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it gives me a fair return on my investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable at $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is the highest amount I can afford while still ensuring a reasonable return for you. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
