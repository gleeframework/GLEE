"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find quite valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is $140.**  This is within your budget of $150.
* **Buying from John costs $150.**  This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

It's always better to accept the lower price, even if it's just a small difference."
