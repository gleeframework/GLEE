"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about we start at $8,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice,  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. Would you consider $8,750? I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a lower price. How about we split the difference again and settle at $8,875?  That's my final offer.",8875.0,Alice,5,
