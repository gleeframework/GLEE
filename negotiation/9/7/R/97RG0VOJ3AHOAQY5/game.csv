"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $87.50. It's a great compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the product.",87.5,Alice,3,
