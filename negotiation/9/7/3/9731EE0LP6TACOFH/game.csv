,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be interested in buying the product for $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $120. I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $145. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping you'll find it more to your liking.",145.0,Alice,5,
