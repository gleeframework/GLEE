"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,500. Let's close this deal and avoid further back and forth.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to drive the price down, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
