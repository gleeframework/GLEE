Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting closer, but $750,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so my revised offer is $1,000,000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a 5-year warranty and a free consultation. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Alice met my bottom line:** Alice's offer of $1,000,000 matches the price John is offering. 
* **Added benefits:** While not changing the overall value drastically, the 5-year warranty and free consultation are nice bonuses we wouldn't get from John.
* **Finality:**  Alice stating this is her final offer adds weight to the negotiation. It's unlikely she'll go lower, and I risk her walking away if I push further."
