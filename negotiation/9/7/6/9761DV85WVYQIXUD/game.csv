"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,250,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we try $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, but $750,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so my revised offer is $1,000,000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a 5-year warranty and a free consultation. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
