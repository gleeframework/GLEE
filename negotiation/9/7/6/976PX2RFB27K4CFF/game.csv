"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I've done my research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $750,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $675,000? That's a fair offer considering its value to me.",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $675,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $725,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However,  $725,000 is still a little too high for my budget. My final offer is $700,000. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. ",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $725,000, and that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",725000.0,Alice,7,
