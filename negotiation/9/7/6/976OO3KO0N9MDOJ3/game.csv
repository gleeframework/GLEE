"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,350,000. How about we meet at $1,300,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
