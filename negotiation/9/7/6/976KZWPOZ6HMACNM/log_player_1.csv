"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price, knowing it's the maximum Bob is willing to pay. This forces him to either accept or make a counteroffer, giving me a chance to gauge his interest and negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum value.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,100,000, which is still above Bob's maximum value but closer to his offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to give up too much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure to sell, I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm offering $1,050,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's maximum. I'm hoping he'll see this as a sign of good faith and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at his maximum value, which means there is no room for further negotiation.  While it's below my ideal price, it's still better than selling to John and I only have a few rounds left. I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale."
