"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial price of $925,000. This feels like a fair starting point given the potential benefits you'll gain.",925000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident that this product can bring you significant value exceeding that price. How about we meet in the middle at $890,000?",890000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I still think $850,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $890,000, which would be $870,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",870000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  While $870,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a little more. Let's settle this right now - how about $880,000? This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties.",880000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $880,000. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Bob,6,
