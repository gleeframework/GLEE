Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $22,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be a great asset to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation Isn't Realistic:** In a real negotiation, you wouldn't know Bob's true valuation of the product ($8,000). You only have your own valuation and the knowledge of your alternative buyer (John).
* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, it implies a strong belief in the product's value. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** By offering it at $22,000, you give Bob the opportunity to counter-offer, potentially revealing more about his perceived value.  

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or typical pricing in the market for similar products. If you had more information, you could tailor your approach."
