Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I believe I can still get a better deal with further negotiations, or I can always sell to John for $10,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,200 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to close the deal. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 8500}
