"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth around $8,000 for my needs.  Would you consider a price closer to that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $8,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This product truly is valuable and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $14,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we try $10,000? That's a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate fairly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up from your initial offer.  However, the value of this product is truly closer to my initial asking price.  Let's settle this now - how about $12,500?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $12,500 is still pushing my budget. I can go up to $11,000, but that's really as high as I can go. It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to John's offer of $15,000.  At this point, the potential gain from continuing the negotiation with Bob is outweighed by the certainty of a guaranteed sale with John."
