"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth around $8,000 for my needs.  Would you consider a price closer to that range?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $8,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This product truly is valuable and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $14,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we try $10,000? That's a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate fairly.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up from your initial offer.  However, the value of this product is truly closer to my initial asking price.  Let's settle this now - how about $12,500? This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $12,500 is still pushing my budget. I can go up to $11,000, but that's really as high as I can go. It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
