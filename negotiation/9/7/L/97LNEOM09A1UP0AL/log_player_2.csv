"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a steal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $120 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, accepting her offer is the best strategy. This allows you to potentially get the product at a lower price than John's offer."
