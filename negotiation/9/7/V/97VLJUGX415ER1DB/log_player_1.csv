Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe the product's value to me is lower than its value to you, and I'd like to negotiate a price that's more in line with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a price of $950,000 would be more reasonable. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.
