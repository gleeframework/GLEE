"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling willingness to negotiate by inviting Bob to share his thoughts. 

I'll keep an eye on Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers (or lack thereof). I'll also consider the possibility of selling to John if negotiations with Bob seem to be dragging on or going nowhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $100 that I'm comfortable with.
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and can potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $100 provides me with a good fallback option if the negotiation with Bob fails. 

**Next steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested!  I'm willing to come down to $95, but that's really my bottom line.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Setting a firm bottom line:** I'm communicating that $95 is my minimum, to encourage Bob to accept or make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired range.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm staying friendly and polite to keep the negotiation positive.

**Next steps:**  I'll monitor Bob's response and decide whether to accept his counteroffer (if he makes one) or proceed to the next round. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below my minimum:**  $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Potential to negotiate higher:** Although Bob is pushing for a lower price, I still believe there's potential to get closer to my minimum by countering his offer.
* **John's offer is a strong backup:**  I can always sell to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next steps:** I will counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum while still being reasonable considering Bob's counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $85 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a sale."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($95) and Bob's last offer ($85), showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price for both of us"", appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and potentially encouraging him to accept.
* **Avoiding a stalemate:**  I'm trying to avoid a stalemate by offering a price that's reasonably close to both of our positions. 

**Next steps:** I'll carefully observe Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. Would you be willing to consider a price of $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $87 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Closing in on a deal:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired range, it's still not a price I'm happy with.
* **John's offer is a strong backup:**  I can always sell to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next steps:** I will counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum while still being reasonable considering Bob's counteroffers.  I might even propose a slightly lower counteroffer than before, but I'll still be wary of going too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $89, but that's really my final offer. Let me know if that works for you, or we can just call it a day."", ""product_price"": 89} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm offering a price that's just $2 away from Bob's last offer, showing I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Setting a Deadline:**  I'm signaling that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to decide.
* **Preparing for a Potential End:** By mentioning ""we can just call it a day"", I'm subtly reminding Bob that if he doesn't accept, I have other options (John).

**Next Steps:**

This is a critical round. If Bob accepts, great! If not, I'll have to carefully consider whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $84? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below my minimum:** $84 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiations Stalled:** Bob's offer shows he's unlikely to budge much further. Continuing to negotiate could result in more rounds without a successful outcome.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're approaching the end of our negotiation rounds, making selling to John the more prudent option.

**Next Steps:**

I'm going to stop negotiating with Bob and sell the product to John for $100, ensuring I get a price that meets my minimum requirements."
