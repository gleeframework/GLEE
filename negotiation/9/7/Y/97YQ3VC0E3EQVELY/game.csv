"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I appreciate the offer, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's keep this negotiation going, I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $975,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
