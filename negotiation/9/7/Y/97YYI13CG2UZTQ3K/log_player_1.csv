"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  I understand its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to start with a price of $2,000,000.  This reflects the product's true worth and provides you with a great opportunity. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting with a high price ($2,000,000) sets the stage for a strong negotiating position.  It also reflects the product's value to Alice, while leaving room for negotiation.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, appealing to his interest.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message also expresses a willingness to find a price that works for both parties, creating a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $2,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,000,000 is significantly below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting it would result in a significant financial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested.  There's potential to negotiate a higher price in subsequent rounds.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed profit, it's not the best outcome.  Alice still has 9 rounds to try and get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is lower than what I had in mind, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product and provides you with a strong return on your investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Firm Price:** Alice sticks to her minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This signals her commitment to achieving a fair deal while also showing a willingness to compromise.
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Framing:**  Alice uses language that suggests a collaborative approach (""meet in the middle""). This encourages Bob to see the offer as a reasonable compromise.
* **Highlight Value and Return:** The message reiterates the product's value and highlights the potential return on investment for Bob, making the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle on $1,200,000? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** $1,200,000 is still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would mean losing out on a significant amount of money.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Even though Bob's offer is low, it shows he's getting closer to Alice's desired price. With 6 rounds remaining, there's still room for negotiation to achieve a better price.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a sure thing, it's not the most desirable outcome.  Alice can still try to get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,200,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000,  This price acknowledges your budget while still ensuring I receive a fair value for the product. It's a significant investment for you, and I'm confident you'll see a great return. Let's finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise, but Firm:** Alice compromises slightly by lowering her price to $1,350,000. This shows flexibility but still keeps the price above her minimum threshold.
* **Emphasize Value and Return:** Alice reinforces the value of the product and the potential return on investment for Bob.  This is a key motivator for him to consider the offer.
* **Urgency and Finality:** The message suggests a sense of urgency (""finalize this deal"") to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

With only 5 rounds left, Alice needs to find a balance between being flexible and holding firm on her desired price. The counteroffer strategically lowers the price slightly but still maintains a significant profit margin. The focus is on finding a price that Bob is likely to accept while ensuring Alice's financial goals are met."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,350,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to Alice's minimum, $1,250,000 is still below the $1,500,000 she needs to feel comfortable selling the product.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  With only 4 rounds left, Alice still has time to try to push for a higher price. There's a good chance Bob will eventually be willing to increase his offer to a more acceptable level, especially if he wants to secure the deal.
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, but it's not the ideal outcome. Alice still wants to see if she can get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds.

**Strategy:**

Alice needs to balance the risk of walking away with the potential for a higher price from Bob. By continuing to negotiate, she can explore if a mutually agreeable price is possible. If Bob doesn't budge further, she can always fall back on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  However,  I want to make this deal happen.  I'm offering a final compromise of $1,300,000.  This price represents a significant investment for you,  and I'm confident you'll see a strong return.  This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** Alice is lowering her price slightly to $1,300,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit above her minimum. 
* **Urgency and Finality:**  The message stresses that this is a ""final compromise"" and encourages Bob to accept the offer before it's too late.  This adds a sense of urgency and motivates Bob to make a decision.
* **Highlighting Value and Return:** Alice again emphasizes the product's value and the potential for a strong return on investment, reminding Bob of the benefits of the deal.

**Strategy:**

With only 3 rounds remaining, Alice needs to make a decisive move. This counteroffer represents a significant compromise on her part, but it's still a profitable deal for her. The message aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, making him more likely to accept the offer before time runs out."
