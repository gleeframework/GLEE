"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a fair price considering its worth to you.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $90. I understand that it's a bit lower than what I initially offered, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell it to you for $110. It's a great compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $105?  I'm really interested in the product and  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell it to you for $115. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",115.0,Alice,5,
