"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Since you are willing to pay up to $120, and John is offering the product for that price, there's no need to negotiate with Alice."
