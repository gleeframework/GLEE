Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $8,250. This is my final offer on this price point.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $8,250.  At this point, buying from John for $8,000 is the best option to minimize cost even if it means a slightly smaller potential saving."
