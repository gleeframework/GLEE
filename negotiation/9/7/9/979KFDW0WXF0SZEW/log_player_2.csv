"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as you've mentioned the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than its value to her, it's still higher than the $10,000 John is willing to sell it for. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of getting a better deal from her or ultimately buying from John at your target price."
