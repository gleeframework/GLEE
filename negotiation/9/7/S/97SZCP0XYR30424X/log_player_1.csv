"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm starting the conversation at $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for your business."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):** We're aiming for significantly above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's valuation ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a strong position.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high initial price, implying it's worth more than Bob might think.
* **Leaving Room:** While the initial price is high, it's not so outrageous that it would instantly offend Bob and halt negotiations.  

**Strategy:**

The goal is to anchor the negotiation high. Even if Bob counteroffers much lower, the starting point influences the trajectory of the bargaining process. We have John as a safety net, so we can afford to be a bit bolder in these early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below our minimum acceptable price. We have plenty of rounds left, and Bob's counteroffer indicates serious interest.  We'll counter to guide the negotiation closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. I understand your perspective on the price, but the value this product brings, particularly in terms of [mention a specific benefit relevant to Bob], is significant. I'm willing to move down to $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:** We're showing flexibility by decreasing our asking price, acknowledging Bob's counteroffer.
* **Smaller Concession:**  The reduction is $150,000, a smaller amount than Bob's initial move. This signals that we're not desperate and value the product highly.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We're reiterating the product's benefits, focusing on something specific to Bob's needs to justify the price. 
* **""Fair Compromise"":**  This framing positions our offer as a balanced solution, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counter.

**Strategy:**

We're still aiming high, but with a willingness to negotiate. By moving in smaller increments and highlighting value, we aim to guide Bob towards a price closer to $2,000,000 or higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the benefits I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:**  $2,050,000 is a strong offer, exceeding our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 by a significant margin.
* **""Meeting Halfway"":** Bob's framing suggests he's made a substantial concession and might be less likely to move much higher.
* **Time Value:** While we have rounds remaining, securing a deal now avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential impasse. 

**Outcome:**

Accepting this offer guarantees a profitable sale and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
