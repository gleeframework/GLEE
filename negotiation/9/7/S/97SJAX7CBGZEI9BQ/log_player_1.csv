"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product, trying to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Accepting it would mean losing a substantial amount of money.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price but still acknowledges Bob's budget constraints. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, but I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't come down to $800,000, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but still staying above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us.
* **Open Communication:** I'm inviting Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price range, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's still room for a slightly higher counteroffer. I believe I can get closer to my goal of $1,000,000 or even slightly higher.
* **Leverage with John:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This price reflects the value of the product and is still within your budget.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by moving halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous offer.
* **Focus on Value and Budget:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product while reassuring Bob that the price is still within his budget.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by saying ""Let's make this deal happen"" to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm glad we're making progress. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final price of $960,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm only $40,000 away from my target, and I'm confident I can get Bob to move a little further.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I want to see if I can get that extra $40,000 from Bob. It's worth a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your flexibility and we're almost there.  I'm willing to come down to $965,000.  This is a fair compromise that shows we're both committed to making this deal work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 965000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm making a small compromise by moving $5,000 closer to Bob's offer, but still remaining above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Mutual Commitment:** I'm emphasizing that we're both working towards a deal, and that I'm showing commitment by being flexible.
* **Final Push:** I'm suggesting that this is a fair final compromise, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my perspective, Alice. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that suits both of us. In light of our previous offers, I would like to propose a final price of $962,500 for the product. I hope this will be a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Enough:** While Bob's offer of $962,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable value, I'm only two rounds away from having to sell to John.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will reject my next counteroffer, and I'll be forced to sell to John.
* **Time is Money:** The potential gain from a few more rounds of negotiation is not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.  It's better to secure the $1,000,000 from John and move on."
