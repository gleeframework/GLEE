"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least $800,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle again?",775000.0,Bob,4,
