"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Considering its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget for this product. I understand its value to you, but I'm only able to offer $700,000 at this time. This would still be a profitable sale for you, and I'm confident we can make this work.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is still a good price for you given your valuation.  Let's make this deal happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,
