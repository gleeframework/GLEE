"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe its value is significant, and I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm opening with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher sale price. 
* **Confidence and fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and presenting the starting price as fair.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm signaling flexibility to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This approach aims to initiate a dialogue with Bob while establishing a strong starting position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2000000. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not going to accept it right away. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm not desperate to sell, and having John as an option gives me leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain. "", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but not accepting it. Instead, I'm proposing a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's price but still significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Highlighting value and compromise:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and portraying my counteroffer as a compromise on my part to demonstrate good faith.
* **Focus on benefits:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential benefits he will gain from owning the product to encourage him to see the value in my counteroffer.

This approach aims to maintain a negotiation while demonstrating my willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum of $1,500,000. While I'm running out of rounds, I'm still holding out for a better price. Selling to John would be a safe bet, but I want to see if I can still squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,400,000 simply doesn't cover the costs associated with this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** I'm stating this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency.
* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm using this phrase to imply a fair compromise without completely conceding.
* **Focus on interests:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get while emphasizing the cost on my side. 

This approach aims to create a sense of finality and encourage Bob to accept the offer before I have to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1550000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the market value of similar products. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and we are down to the last few rounds. I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and I'm not willing to take the chance of getting a lower price from Bob."
