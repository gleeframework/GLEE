"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2000000. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1500000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain. ",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the market value of similar products.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1400000 simply doesn't cover the costs associated with this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1550000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects both our interests.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
