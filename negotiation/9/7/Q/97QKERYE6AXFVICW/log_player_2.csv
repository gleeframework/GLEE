"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $10,000, Bob can get the product for $8,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the $8,000 price from John, but it's worth trying to get a bit closer to that with Alice. Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, showing a willingness to negotiate while still staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $8,500, which is closer to Bob's target price of $8,000. While Bob could still try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject his counteroffer and then offer a higher price. It's also possible that John could raise his price if he learns of the ongoing negotiation. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $8,500 is the most logical choice, as it minimizes the risk of losing the product and getting a worse price."
