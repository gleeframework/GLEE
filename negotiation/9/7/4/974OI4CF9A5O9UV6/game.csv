"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it will be highly beneficial for your business. My asking price is $1150000. This reflects the product's true worth and allows for some room for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1150000 is unfortunately outside of my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1050000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This price still reflects the significant value of the product, but also shows my willingness to work with you.  Let me know if this is something you can consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1075000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1075000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1090000.  This reflects a compromise on my end and demonstrates my desire to reach an agreement.  Let's try to close this deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
