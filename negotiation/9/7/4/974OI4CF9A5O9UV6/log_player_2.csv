"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it will be highly beneficial for your business. My asking price is $1150000. This reflects the product's true worth and allows for some room for negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $1,150,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** Alice acknowledges that her asking price is negotiable. This means you can likely get a better price.
* **Jhon's offer is your fallback:** You have a guaranteed alternative if negotiations with Alice fail. 

By rejecting the offer, you initiate counter-negotiation to potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
