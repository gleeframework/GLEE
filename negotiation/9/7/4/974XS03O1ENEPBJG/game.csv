"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $12,500 is a good price for you, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,750? ",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,750 is still a bit above your comfort zone. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'll sell the product to you for $13,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.
