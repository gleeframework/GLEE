"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $825,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this happen.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I still believe we can find a middle ground. Would $775,000 be acceptable to you?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there with $775,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it ensures a smooth transaction for both of us. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
