This offer is a starting point. It allows me to gain some profit while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.  I'm confident that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I think we can work out a better price. How about $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $800,000.  I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I still believe we can find a middle ground. Would $775,000 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still feel I can get a better price. I will counteroffer again, hoping to find a deal that benefits both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there with $775,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000?
