Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum price, making it appealing to Bob. However, it still leaves me with a profit of $2,000. 

I've added a message to be more conversational and build rapport with Bob. This can make him more likely to consider the offer and potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to earn. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your offer, Alice. While I would like to stay within my budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This price reflects the value I see in the product while keeping it within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise and ensures I sell the product without having to go through more rounds of negotiation. The $9,250 offer is closer to my target than selling to John for $12,000. It's important to weigh the potential of a higher offer against the time and effort involved in further negotiations."
