Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential ROI for you. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows her product's worth to her ($1,200,000) and John's willingness to pay.  She starts with a strong offer of $1,100,000, leaving room for negotiation but aiming to maximize profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price and create a sense of scarcity and desirability. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, Alice keeps the door open for counter-offers while still anchoring the price point high. 
* **Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice has John as a guaranteed buyer at her desired minimum price. This gives her leverage in the negotiation."
