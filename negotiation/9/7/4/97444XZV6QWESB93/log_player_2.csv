Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $5,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to your business.

Alice is coming down, but we can still try to get a better price.  We're closer to John's price than hers."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm now offering the product to you for $8,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Alice is unlikely to come down much further, and we risk her going back up in price. John's $8,000 offer is the better deal at this point."
