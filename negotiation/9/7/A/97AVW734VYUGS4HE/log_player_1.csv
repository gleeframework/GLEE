Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85, given my budget and the fact that I can get a similar product from John for $80. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
