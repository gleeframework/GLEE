"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85, given my budget and the fact that I can get a similar product from John for $80. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the unique features and high-quality materials used in our product, I believe a price of $95 would be fair for both parties involved. This allows you to enjoy the benefits of our product while keeping your expenses manageable. I look forward to your consideration.",95.0,Alice,3,
