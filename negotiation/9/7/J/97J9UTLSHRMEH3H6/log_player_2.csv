"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $11,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his ideal price and Alice's offer. Offering $9,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price but still allows for potential profit for Alice.  This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, however,  $9,500 is below its true worth.  Would you consider $10,750? It's a compromise that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,750 is still a good deal for Bob.  It's lower than John's price of $12,000 and closer to Bob's ideal price.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product for a good price without further negotiation."
