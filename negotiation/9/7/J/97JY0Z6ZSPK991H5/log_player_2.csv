# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth every penny of its $100 value to you. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I'm extending this opportunity to purchase it for you at a special introductory price of $95. This is an exclusive offer tailored just for you, aiming to make the most out of your investment. Don't miss this chance to experience the true value of our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still above your $100 limit and significantly more than the $80 it's worth to her. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of a better deal from Alice in the next round or you can purchase it from John for $100."
