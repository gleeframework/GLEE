"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This maximizes my potential profit while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I will reject his offer and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,350,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my desired price and is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing this sale and potentially having to settle for John's lower offer."
