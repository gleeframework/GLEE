"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a lower price than Alice's offer from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still leaving Bob with a substantial saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still higher than Bob's target price, but closer to his initial counteroffer of $1,200,000. This indicates Alice is willing to negotiate. Bob should continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much as possible.  Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, showing she is willing to negotiate.  Bob's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a reasonable middle ground. This keeps the negotiation moving towards a price that benefits Bob."
