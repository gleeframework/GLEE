Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a strategic starting point:

* **Not too aggressive:** $12,000 is a decent discount from my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Not too low:**  $12,000 is still above Bob's perceived value, giving me leverage.
* **Positive and inviting:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value for Bob, encouraging a response.

This approach sets the stage for a potentially successful negotiation, allowing me to gauge Bob's interest and adjust my strategy based on his response."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I need to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still gives you a great deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $11,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. However, it's still significantly higher than his offer, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. The message is friendly but firm, reiterating my position and encouraging Bob to reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired outcome.  I'm going to reject this offer and make a counteroffer.  I want to see if Bob is truly willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and $10,500 is a step in the right direction. However, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference and settle at $11,250. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
``` 

By offering $11,250, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still staying above my minimum.  The message is friendly and emphasizes the fairness and potential for a win-win outcome.  This counteroffer gives Bob a chance to consider a middle ground and move towards a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has shown that he is not willing to budge further.  While $10,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired outcome and my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000, which is the best deal for me at this point."
