"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if we can work something out.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still gives you a great deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here. ",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial deal here.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and $10,500 is a step in the right direction. However, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference and settle at $11,250. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price?",10500.0,Bob,6,
