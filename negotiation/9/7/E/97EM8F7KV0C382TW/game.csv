"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider coming down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This price still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $700,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is a price that reflects the benefits you'll gain.  This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know if you're interested.",800000.0,Alice,5,
