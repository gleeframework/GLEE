"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's high enough to potentially entice Bob, but it also leaves room for negotiation.  It's also lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000,  which allows me to negotiate downwards if needed, or to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider coming down to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and even lower than what the product is worth to him. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This price still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise. It's still above Bob's initial offer and my minimum acceptable price, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this price will be enticing enough for Bob to consider while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially with John's offer as a backup.  I'll counter with another offer to see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $700,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is a price that reflects the benefits you'll gain.  This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm sticking with a price that is closer to what I think the product is worth, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept, as it's still a good deal for him. If he rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John."
