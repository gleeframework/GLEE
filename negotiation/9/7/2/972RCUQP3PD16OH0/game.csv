"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $9,000 is too far below what it's worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
