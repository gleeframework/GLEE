Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,350,000.  This is a chance to acquire it before it goes to another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the Backup:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000. This gives you a strong position to negotiate from.
* **Targeting Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000.  You need to offer a price that's significantly less than your backup but still high enough that Bob might consider it a good deal.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning another interested party, you introduce a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to strike a balance:

* **Maximize Profit:**  The offered price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming for the highest possible profit.
* **Increase Likelihood of Sale:** While the price is high, it leaves room for negotiation and might entice Bob to counter-offer rather than outright rejecting it. 

This strategy allows you to start high with the possibility of negotiating down, always knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer."
