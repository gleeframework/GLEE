Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and my attachment to it, I'm setting the price at $19,000. Let me know if you're interested, this offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $8,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, we want to start high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The $19,000 offer allows room for Bob to negotiate down.  Even if he counter-offers, you're still likely to land above your guaranteed sale price.
* **Time Limit:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster and avoid missing out.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, there's always a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. You have a strong fallback with John's offer, so you're not risking a loss."
