"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $170. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 170}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my budget. I can do $140, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $140 is a good outcome. It's a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiation."
