"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking for a price closer to $850,000.  This product holds significant value to me, but I need to ensure it fits within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's unique features and benefits.",900000.0,Alice,3,,
