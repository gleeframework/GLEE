Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $100 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $120.

{""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $90. Since the product is worth $100 to him, I'm not thrilled about selling it to him at a loss. However, I also don't want to risk Bob walking away and not buying the product at all.

Let's see... I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer of my own. I'll try to get closer to my original price of $120, but still be reasonable and competitive.

I'll offer Bob $110.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob rejected my counteroffer again! He's still trying to get the price down, but I'm not willing to give up yet.

I'll think about it... Hmm... $95 is still a bit too low for me, but I don't want to risk Bob walking away again. I'll decide to make another counteroffer, trying to find a sweet spot between $95 and my original price of $120.

Let's see... I'll offer Bob $105.
