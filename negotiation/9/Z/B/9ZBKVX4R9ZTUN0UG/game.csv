"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about $9,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
