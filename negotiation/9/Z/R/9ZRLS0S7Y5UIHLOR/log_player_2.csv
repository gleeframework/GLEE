"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is still too high.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account your concerns about the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer is still higher than what Bob is comfortable with, but it's a good sign that she's willing to negotiate.  Bob should continue to counter-offer and see if he can bring the price down further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to both of us.  I believe this is a good compromise and hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to the wire, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1020000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice is coming down in price, $1,020,000 is still too high for Bob. He's willing to go up to $1,000,000, and there's still room for Alice to come down a bit further.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if he can get a better price before having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,020,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,010,000 for the product.  This is a good compromise, and I believe we can close the deal at this price.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1010000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to the limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1015000, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower than that. This is a tough negotiation, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,015,000, which is only $15,000 more than Bob's last offer.  There's a good chance that Alice will reject another counter-offer from Bob. It's getting close to the limit, and buying from John would cost Bob $1,200,000, which is significantly higher.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point, as it saves Bob $95,000 compared to buying from John."
