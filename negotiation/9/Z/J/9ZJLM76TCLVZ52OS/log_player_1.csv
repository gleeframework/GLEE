"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love!  I'm asking for $14,000, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also stating that I'm open to hearing his thoughts, which indicates flexibility and encourages him to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This price still allows me some profit while giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still lower than my ideal price, but it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's also a good compromise that allows us to both reach a mutually agreeable price.  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely and having to sell to John for only $15,000."
