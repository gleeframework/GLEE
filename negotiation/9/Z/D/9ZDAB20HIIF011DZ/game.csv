"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial offer already reflects a willingness to negotiate. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,025,000. This price recognizes the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is simply too far from what I consider a fair deal for a product of this caliber. I'm willing to consider $1,000,000, but that's my final offer. It reflects the true value and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
