Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a good starting point:** It's higher than Bob's value ($12,000) but lower than your value ($15,000), giving both of you room for negotiation. 
* **A friendly message:**  A positive and encouraging message can help sway Bob towards accepting the offer.
* **A clear price:**  Explicitly stating the price avoids any ambiguity.

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Higher profit:** While you're willing to sell to John for $15,000, you're trying to maximize your profit by selling to Bob for a slightly lower price.
* **Potentially faster sale:** If Bob accepts, you sell the product immediately.
* **Negotiation space:**  If Bob rejects, you still have the option of selling to John, but now you can use this information to potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob if he decides to come back."
