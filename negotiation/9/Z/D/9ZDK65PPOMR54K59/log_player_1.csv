Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can we discuss further?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 8
Bob's offer:

I'd like to propose a price of $1,275,000, which is my absolute maximum. If we can meet at this price, I'm willing to move forward with the deal.

``` 
While $1,275,000 is only slightly above John's offer, it's important to remember that we're nearing the end of the negotiation and there are only two rounds left. There's a risk that if we reject Bob's offer, he might not counteroffer again, and we could be left with John's offer, which is only slightly better than our minimum price."
