"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is below the product's value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This offer reflects its worth while acknowledging your budget.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
