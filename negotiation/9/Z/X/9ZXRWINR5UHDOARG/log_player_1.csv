Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Please let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:** This is a starting point for the negotiation. It's higher than my minimum value ($15,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** This message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob. It encourages him to consider the offer without being overly aggressive. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:** I want to get the best possible price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  I'm prepared to go lower if necessary, but I don't want to start too low. 
* **Be clear and concise:** I'm directly stating my price and offering a reason for Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $18000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to push for a higher price. I believe I can potentially get more by counter-offering.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can signal that I'm not desperate to sell and maintain leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $18,000 is a good offer, I need to recover a bit more to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** This is a compromise.  I've lowered my price from $20,000 to $19,000, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price above Bob's initial offer.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's concerns and maintain a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive. This message avoids an ultimatum and leaves room for further discussion.

This strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrate that I'm willing to work with Bob.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By counter-offering, I'm not accepting his initial offer, signaling I still value the product highly.
* **Be clear and concise:** I'm specific about my counteroffer and reiterate my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still feel that we might be able to find common ground. Could you consider $18500 as a fair price for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $18,500 is only $500 away from my minimum acceptable price of $18,000.  Considering the back-and-forth and Bob's potential willingness to negotiate further, accepting this offer is the best option. I don't want to risk pushing Bob away and ending up with a lower offer, or worse, having to sell to John for $15,000.  $18,500 is a good compromise and a successful outcome for this negotiation."
