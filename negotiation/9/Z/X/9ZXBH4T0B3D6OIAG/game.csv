"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800000 at this time. This is my best and final offer.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is significantly below the value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers.  Let's work together to find a solution.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to pay $900000, which reflects the value I place on the product.  I hope we can find a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  While $900000 is closer to my desired price, I can't go lower than $1000000.  This final offer reflects the true value of the product and allows me to secure a reasonable return.  Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
