"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me there?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to buying from John at $8,000, but I really like the product. Can you meet me at $8,500? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to be within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.  Let's make this deal happen.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $8,500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm starting to lose interest in continuing negotiations. If you're not willing to meet me at $8,500, I'll have to consider buying from John at $8,000.",8500.0,Bob,6,
