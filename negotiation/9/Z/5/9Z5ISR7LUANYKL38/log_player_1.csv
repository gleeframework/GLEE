``` 

This is a starting point. It's a good strategy to start with a price that is slightly lower than your minimum but still gives you room to negotiate.  By offering a lower price initially, you encourage Bob to think the deal is worthwhile and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000. I am not willing to sell at such a low price. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to buying from John at $8,000, but I really like the product. Can you meet me at $8,500? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum of $12,000, it's still not an acceptable price for me. I believe I can get a better offer from Bob or negotiate a more favorable counteroffer. Selling to John is always an option, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $8,500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm starting to lose interest in continuing negotiations. If you're not willing to meet me at $8,500, I'll have to consider buying from John at $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear that he is unwilling to budge on his price, and I've already made several concessions.  It seems like further negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful.  To maximize my profit, I'll sell to John for $12,000."
