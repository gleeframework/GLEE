I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. While $7,000 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I have more rounds to get a better offer, and I can always sell to John for $8,000 if necessary."

I'm making a final counteroffer at my minimum price, hoping that Bob will accept.  I'm confident that John will buy it for this price if Bob doesn't, so I'm not willing to go any lower."
