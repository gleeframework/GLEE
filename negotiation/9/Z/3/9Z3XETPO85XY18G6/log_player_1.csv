Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with my highest possible price, knowing that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at this price. This gives me the best possible starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired price, but I'm still not satisfied. I will try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aim for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum desired price, and it would be a loss to sell to John for only $10,000.  I'm accepting Bob's offer and moving forward with the sale."
