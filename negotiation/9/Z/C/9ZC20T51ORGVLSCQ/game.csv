"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my budget.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
