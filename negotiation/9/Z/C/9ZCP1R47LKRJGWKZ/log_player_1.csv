This offer gives me a significant profit while still leaving some room for negotiation.  It's likely Bob will counteroffer, but I'm confident I can get a price closer to my ideal range through negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but based on my budget, I am only willing to pay $850,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
