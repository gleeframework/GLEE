{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm open to negotiation. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $15,000? Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on it. I am willing to pay $14000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by counter-offering.  I'll see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest.  While I value the product highly, $14,000 is a bit below what I'm aiming for. Would you be willing to go up to $14,500? I think that would make a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to increase my offer to $14200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, as Bob's offer is still a bit lower than I hoped for. However, it's getting closer to my minimum, and the risk of him dropping out or me not getting a better offer from John makes this a good opportunity. I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
