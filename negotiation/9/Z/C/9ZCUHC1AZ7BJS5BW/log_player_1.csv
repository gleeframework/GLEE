"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my price down in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price of $120. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135, which is halfway between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still remaining above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is above my minimum desired price of $120 and it's a good deal considering he initially rejected my offer of $140. It's worth taking this deal to avoid further negotiations and potential risks."
