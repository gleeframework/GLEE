"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,250,000 undervalues its potential. I can be flexible, but I'm looking for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we meet halfway at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your point about the product's value, but I still think $1,250,000 is a fair price. However, I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about we meet at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
