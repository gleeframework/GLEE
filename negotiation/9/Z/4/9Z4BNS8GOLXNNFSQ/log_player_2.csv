"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $950,000 is still a significant amount above Alice's value of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is still profitable for him while also being appealing enough for Alice. He is offering $850,000, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $950,000. This price is also well above Alice's value of $800,000, giving her an incentive to accept. This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap and hopefully lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer slightly, but it's still far above what Bob is willing to pay. Bob is determined to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increasing his offer from $850,000 to $900,000, but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer of $975,000.  This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to negotiate, but not willing to overpay. It's possible Alice will accept, or at least come down further in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is increasingly unwilling to budge, and her offer of $990,000 is very close to Bob's maximum acceptable price. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice walking away or continuing to raise the price. Buying from John for $1,500,000 provides a guarantee of acquiring the product, even though it's a higher price. Bob needs to weigh the risk of further negotiation versus the certainty of buying from John. In this case, the risk of continuing negotiation outweighs the potential savings, making buying from John the more logical choice."
