"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and presenting yours.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below the value I place on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to find a compromise.  I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the true value of what I'm offering.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  While $1,700,000 is closer to what I can afford, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both place on this product. Let's find a way to bridge the gap and make this deal happen.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
