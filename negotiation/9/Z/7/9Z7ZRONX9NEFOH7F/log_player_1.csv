Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and presenting yours.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below the value I place on this product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is now showing a willingness to move considerably from his initial offer. However, $1,200,000 is still significantly less than John's offer. It's worth countering again to explore if Bob can be pushed closer to the $1,500,000 mark."

Round 5

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move from your initial offer. To show I'm serious about finding an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  While $1,700,000 is closer to what I can afford, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both place on this product. Let's find a way to bridge the gap and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now very close to John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  

* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means getting the money sooner. Waiting for more rounds with Bob or going to John introduces uncertainty and delays the payment. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate can be tiring and frustrating. Accepting a reasonable offer now avoids potential impasses or negative feelings.

While there's a chance Bob could be pushed slightly higher, it's a relatively small gain for the added risk and time involved.  Accepting $1,400,000 is a strong and pragmatic business decision."
