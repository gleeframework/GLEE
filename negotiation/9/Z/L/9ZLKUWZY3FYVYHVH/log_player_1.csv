Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize my profit.  I believe this price gives Bob a good deal while still leaving me some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the value of my product.  This offer leaves room for further negotiation while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that we're too far apart on price.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with, so I'm going to sell to him instead."
