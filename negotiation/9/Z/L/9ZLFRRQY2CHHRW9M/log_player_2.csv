"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to me, and considering its value, I believe it's worth more than $80 to you. Let's aim for a fair deal. Would you like to start by suggesting a price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than $120, it's still above your desired price of $80. You have the advantage of knowing John's offer, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer immediately. You can use this knowledge to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above your maximum price point, giving you room for negotiation. This also demonstrates your willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. To continue our discussion towards a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $90 for the product. This allows us some room while still valuing the product appropriately. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $90 is still too high. You have a better option with John, who's willing to sell for $80.  You should continue negotiating with Alice, but always keep John's offer in mind as your fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50?  This would allow us to both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer:

* **Splits the difference:**  It's midway between your last offer ($85) and Alice's current offer ($90), showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Stays within your budget:**  $87.50 is still below your maximum price of $80, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Keeps the pressure on Alice:** This counteroffer signals that you're serious about getting a good deal and are ready to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, I would like to suggest a price of $89 for the product. This offers a slight increase from your last proposal, while still being reasonable for both of us. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $89 is very close to your maximum price of $80. However, it's still outside of your desired range.  Given that you have a guaranteed deal with John at $80, it's not worth risking a further negotiation with Alice.  You're running out of time and there's no guarantee she'll budge further."
