"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but $1,025,000 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle again, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,075,000, which is a bit above my initial target, but I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $1,075,000 is still too far off from my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product for both of us. If you're not willing to go higher, I might have to consider selling to John.",1150000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'm not going any higher. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1075000.0,Bob,8,
