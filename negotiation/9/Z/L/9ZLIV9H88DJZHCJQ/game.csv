"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $92 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for your offer.  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to go down to $88?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",88.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $90 for the product. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really close to my budget, so I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  Would you be willing to do $87?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",87.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're getting close to your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $90. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $87 and $90. How about we try $89?",89.0,Alice,7,
