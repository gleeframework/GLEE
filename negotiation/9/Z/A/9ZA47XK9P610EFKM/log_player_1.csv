""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it will be worth $1,200,000 to you.  I'm asking for $1,190,000, as I believe that price reflects its true worth while still offering you a great deal.  Please let me know your decision, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without risking a rejection.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value creates a sense of a good deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties (even if John is your fallback) adds a subtle pressure to act quickly. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the aim is a quick sale, there's a small buffer if Bob tries to negotiate further."
