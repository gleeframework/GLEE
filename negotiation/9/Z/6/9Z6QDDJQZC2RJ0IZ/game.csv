"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, and I'd like to get a better deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great value for a product worth so much to you.  Let's meet in the middle on this.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,025,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,025,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,037,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price that will benefit both of us.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to consider $1,025,000 again. I'm not sure I'm comfortable going any higher than that, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. Can we discuss other terms that might make the deal more attractive to me?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
