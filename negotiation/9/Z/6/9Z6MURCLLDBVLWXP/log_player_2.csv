"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Above Alice's Value:** My offer is slightly above Alice's perceived value of the product ($10,000). This increases the chance that she might accept it, as she'd still be making a profit.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  By starting lower, I anticipate Alice might counter, and I'm prepared to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is too low. Could you do $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $13,000 is still a significant markup from her $10,000 valuation. I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving and try to land closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Middle Ground:** I'm incrementally increasing my offer to signal willingness to compromise, but I'm aiming for a price closer to the midpoint between our initial offers.
* **Staying Firm:**  While $11,500 is a significant jump from my last offer, it keeps the pressure on Alice to move further down from her price. 
* **Alternative in Mind:**  I'm keeping in mind that John's offer of $15,000 is always an option if the negotiations with Alice don't yield a satisfactory price."
