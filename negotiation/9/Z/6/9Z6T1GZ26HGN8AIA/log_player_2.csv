The offer from Alice is way above your budget. It's better to counteroffer or buy from John."

This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still above Alice's minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while remaining within Bob's budget."

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."

This offer is closer to Alice's potential acceptance point and still within Bob's budget. It's a good compromise to try to reach a deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget, and it's likely that further counteroffers will only lead to more rounds of back-and-forth without a guarantee of a better price. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product."
