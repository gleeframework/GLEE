Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value and the existence of other potential buyers. This creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept the higher price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can then decide whether to lower the price slightly or hold firm, knowing you have John as a backup."
