"Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price. It's a risk, but potentially worth it to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $7,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,400 is only $100 more than Bob's counteroffer and is a good deal compared to buying from John for $8,000.  It's a good compromise and saves Bob $600 compared to the initial offer.  Further negotiation might save Bob another $100, but the risk of Alice walking away or the deal falling apart isn't worth it at this point."
