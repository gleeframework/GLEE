# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $115. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

```
