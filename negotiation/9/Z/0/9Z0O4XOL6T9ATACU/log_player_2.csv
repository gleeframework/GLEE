Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by 75% to $500,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation. Since I have 10 rounds, there's room to adjust the price if necessary."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer has dropped, it is still significantly higher than my budget. I will continue to negotiate, as I still have several rounds remaining and I believe there is room for Alice to lower the price further. I'm also keeping in mind my option to buy from John for $800,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my offer again, but only by a small amount. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal, but also that I'm not willing to go much higher. I'm hoping that this small increase will be enough to convince Alice to accept, or at least to make a counteroffer that's closer to my budget. If she rejects this offer, I'm prepared to buy from John in the next round, as I am running out of time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. With only one round left, I need to make a decision.  Given the time constraint and the risk that Alice might not accept my counteroffer in the final round,  it is  more prudent to purchase the product from John for $800,000. This guarantees a deal within my budget and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
