"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, knowing I have room to negotiate.  $175 is a good starting point, above Bob's value but still leaving space for a potential deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell it for that amount, as it's below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $150. That's still a good deal for you, and it's fair for me. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
I'm dropping the price to $150, which is my minimum and still leaves some room for potential negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept at this point."
