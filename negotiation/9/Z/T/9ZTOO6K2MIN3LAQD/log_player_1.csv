Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $95.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $95 is still above Bob's perceived value, giving him reason to negotiate.
* **Shows flexibility:**  By offering a price slightly lower than your minimum, you show you are willing to compromise.
* **Sets the tone:** This message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in a conversation.

We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $90?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer within reason:**  $90 is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility while still maintaining a price closer to my minimum.
* **Highlight value:**  I remind Bob that even at $90, he's getting a good deal. 
* **Maintain positive tone:**  I aim to keep the negotiation friendly and constructive, increasing the chance of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $87? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $87 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'm open to negotiating, I don't want to risk going too low and losing out on a better deal.  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so selling to him is the most logical choice at this point."
