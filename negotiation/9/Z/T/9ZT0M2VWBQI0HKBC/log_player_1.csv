"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $20000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10000. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable selling.  I'll counteroffer again and try to get closer to my goal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with your purchase.  Let's try to finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $11000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

While $9,500 is getting close to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering a final price of $10,500.  This is the best I can do, but I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. While $10500 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. Would you consider $10000? I think this price is fair considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had several rounds of negotiation with Bob, but we haven't been able to reach a price I'm comfortable with.  While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation.  It's better to sell to John at a guaranteed $15,000 than to potentially get stuck with a lower price."
