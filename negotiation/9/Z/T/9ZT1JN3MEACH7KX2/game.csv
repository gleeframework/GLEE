"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering its value to both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my original offer was a fair one. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still beneficial to both of us. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1,225,000. This is a very fair price, and it's closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1,225,000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to make another compromise to try to reach an agreement. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,225,000, but I'll throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a comprehensive maintenance package, worth $25,000, absolutely free. This way, you'll get the product at a price that's closer to your budget, and you'll also get some added value. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,5,
