"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the product's value to you is significantly higher. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  $1,100,000 is the highest I'm willing to go at this point.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,125,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on this product.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,125,000, which is closer to Bob's preferred price of $1,100,000.  While further negotiation is possible, accepting this offer saves Bob $75,000 compared to buying from John.  The risk of further negotiation might not be worth the potential savings, especially since Alice has already shown she's willing to compromise."
