"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $8,000 is a bit too low for me, considering its value.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price still gives me a decent profit while offering you a great deal. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000, as I mentioned earlier, but I'm also willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $8,250? I'm willing to pay that price for the product.",8250.0,Bob,4,
