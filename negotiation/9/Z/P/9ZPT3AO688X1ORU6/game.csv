"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $800,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, my budget allows for a maximum of $850,000. If you're able to work within that range, I'm ready to close the deal today.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your transparency, Bob. $850,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'll counter with a price of $920,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I can see you're invested in finding a fair deal, and I respect that. To be completely upfront, $870,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If this works for you, we have an agreement.",870000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. $870,000 is a bit closer to my target, but I'm still not quite there. I'll need to think carefully about this, but I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $900,000, which is the same price I offered earlier. If this doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",900000.0,Alice,7,
