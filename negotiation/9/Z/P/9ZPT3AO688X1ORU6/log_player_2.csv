Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $900,000. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. $870,000 is a bit closer to my target, but I'm still not quite there. I'll need to think carefully about this, but I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $900,000, which is the same price I offered earlier. If this doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer and is firm on the $900,000 price. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away. Accepting at $900,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000 price."
