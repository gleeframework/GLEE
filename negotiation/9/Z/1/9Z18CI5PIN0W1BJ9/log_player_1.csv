Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500.  I believe it offers significant value, but let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with an offer above your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The offer of $14,500 is significantly above Bob's perceived value. This allows Alice to gauge Bob's level of interest and willingness to pay.
* **Fallback Option:**  Alice has a secure fallback option with John at $10,000. This knowledge gives her leverage to be firm in her negotiations with Bob.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Alice earns a significant profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:** Alice can potentially meet Bob somewhere in the middle, still earning more than her minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** Alice sells to John for her minimum acceptable price."
