,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $9,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you consider something closer to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. Let's try $12,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $11,500 is still below what I need.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, and offer $12,500. This is a good middle ground, and allows us to both get a decent deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Alice,7,
