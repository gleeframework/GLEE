"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I understand it's worth $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This represents a substantial saving for you, while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000, which is $100,000 less than John's price.
* **You still get a good deal:** Even at $1,400,000, you're saving $100,000 compared to your maximum valuation of $1,500,000. 

It's always beneficial to accept a lower price, especially when it's still within your desired range."
