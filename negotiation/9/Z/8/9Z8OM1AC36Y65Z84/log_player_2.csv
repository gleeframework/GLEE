"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This counter-offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price:** This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal, but it's not so low that it's insulting.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** I'm willing to go up, but I want to see if Alice is willing to come down first. 
* **It's well below my maximum budget:**  Even if Alice counters a bit higher, I have room to negotiate and still stay within my $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $110 is still too high. It's time to push a bit harder and see if she's willing to move closer to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we try to find a compromise closer to the middle? Would you consider $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** By saying ""compromise closer to the middle"", it acknowledges Alice's movement on the price while still pushing for a better deal.
* **Stays below the maximum budget:** $75 keeps me well within my $80 limit.
* **Leaves room for a final counter:**  There's still some space to negotiate if Alice is stuck at a price point slightly above $75."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. How about $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $95, and that's too close to my absolute limit.  It's time to walk away and buy from John for the guaranteed $80."
