"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This represents a significant value for you, as you've indicated it's worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 would be more expensive. Accepting Alice's offer saves you money."
