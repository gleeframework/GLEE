{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,500,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice the minimum she's willing to accept. This is a strong starting point for negotiation, and it puts the pressure on her to either accept or counter with a price closer to my target range."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below my target price. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am not willing to pay a premium. I hope this encourages her to come down in price further."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, it's still above my maximum budget. I have 5 rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm again increasing my offer, but still staying below my target price. With only 4 rounds left, it's time to show Alice that I'm serious about making a deal but also to push her to accept a price closer to my limit. This offer should test her limits and perhaps lead to a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, it's still above my maximum budget. With 3 rounds remaining, there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but I'm still below my target price and only have 2 rounds left.  It's a bit of a gamble, but I think Alice might be willing to come down slightly to avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Alice's final offer, and it's exactly at my maximum budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's a risky move with only one round left. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether and ending up with nothing.  John is offering the product for the same price, so it's a safe and reasonable option.  I'll buy from John and avoid any further negotiation."
