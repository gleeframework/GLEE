"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a bit above my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate while still making a decent profit.  I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can get him to budge a little in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135, which is halfway between my minimum and my initial offer. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not going to settle for a price that low. I'm still hopeful that we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to offer $125. It's still slightly higher than my minimum, but I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to be flexible and come down in price.  It's a decent middle ground that hopefully encourages Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge much, and we're running out of time. While $115 is better than my minimum, I'm not confident we can get a better price in the remaining rounds. Selling to John at $120 guarantees me a decent profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
