"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let's get this deal done!",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This still gives you a good deal, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,550,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $1,450,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal and avoid the risk of losing out on this opportunity.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
