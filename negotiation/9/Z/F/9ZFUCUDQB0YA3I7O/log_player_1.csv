{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:**  It's often better to start with a higher price and then be willing to negotiate down.
* **Leave room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a price that works for both of you. 
* **Maintain the option of selling to John:**  You can always walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to make a deal,  I'm not willing to drop down to $1,100,000. It's below my minimum acceptable price and doesn't represent a fair value for the product.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this work.  Let's find a price that's fair for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is just at my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, it's a fair deal considering the back-and-forth negotiation.  It's also better than selling to John, as this offer saves me time and effort.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
