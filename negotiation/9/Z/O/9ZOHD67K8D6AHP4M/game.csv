"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair offer considering its value to me and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your comfort zone, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
