"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. While it's tempting to consider the product's value to you, it's wiser to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John if the negotiation with Alice fails."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't accept a price that's significantly above what I'm willing to pay. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation or by simply purchasing the product from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your comfort zone, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I don't see a clear path to getting her down to my target price.  Since I have a guaranteed alternative with John for $8,000, it makes more financial sense to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
