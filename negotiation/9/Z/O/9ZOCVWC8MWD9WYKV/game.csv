"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $1,050,000. This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a substantial offer.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is tempting, but we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to come down to $1,012,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1012000.0,Alice,5,
