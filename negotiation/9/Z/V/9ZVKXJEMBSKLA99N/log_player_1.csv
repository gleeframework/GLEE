"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is friendly and focuses on the benefits for Bob, emphasizing the ""great deal"" and ""value"" of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

This strategy aims to get the ball rolling with a strong opening offer while keeping the possibility of a successful deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** While it's closer than his initial offer, I'm not desperate to sell and want to try to push for a better deal.  
* **There are still 8 rounds left.** This gives me time to continue negotiating with Bob. 

My strategy is to try and get closer to my target price. While $10,000 is tempting, I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob has already expressed interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still attempting to maximize my profit.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the ""value of the product"" to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and friendly, hoping to keep the negotiation moving forward.

This approach aims to find a compromise that's acceptable to both parties and keep the deal on track."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. How about we try $9500? I think that's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  Even though he's shown a willingness to move up, his price is still far from my minimum acceptable price. 
* **We have 6 rounds left.**  I'm not desperate to sell right now, and I believe there's still potential to get a better price. 

I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too far below what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is a significant compromise on my end. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm staying firm on my bottom line but also demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting the Compromise:** I'm emphasizing that my counteroffer is ""a significant compromise on my end,"" showing that I'm genuinely trying to meet Bob halfway.
* **Seeking Solution:** I'm framing the offer as a way to find a ""solution that works for both of us,"" promoting a collaborative approach.

This approach is designed to:

* **Increase the pressure on Bob:** By emphasizing my compromise, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to raise his offer.
* **Keep the negotiation going:** Maintaining a positive tone and focusing on finding a solution helps keep the communication open and prevents a breakdown.
* **Maintain my ground:**  I'm still firmly above my minimum acceptable price while showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $10000? I think that's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  While he has shown a willingness to negotiate, his offer is still too far below my target. 
* **We have 4 rounds left.** I want to try and get closer to my target price and believe I still have leverage to do so.

I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob. My goal is to get the best possible deal and I believe that I can still push for a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. But $10,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,250 as a final offer.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm framing this as my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and potentially encourage Bob to accept.
* **Significant Concession:** I'm highlighting my compromise to emphasize the value of this offer and show that I'm genuinely trying to close the deal.
* **Direct Approach:** I'm making it clear that I'm waiting for Bob's decision.

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize my return:**  I'm trying to push for the highest possible price while still being within a reasonable range.
* **Increase the pressure on Bob:** By framing it as a final offer, I'm hoping to get Bob to accept before he risks losing out.
* **Prepare for a potential deal:** This offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for me to potentially accept a slightly lower counteroffer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to get as close to my target price as possible. How about we meet at $9750? I think that's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're down to the last two rounds.  Bob is still stubbornly low, and I don't want to risk a deal falling through.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, which is significantly higher than Bob's latest offer. 
* **No More Room for Compromise:** My final offer was already a significant concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, the risk of further negotiation leading to a failed deal is too high. It's time to take the guaranteed offer and move on."
