"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I suggest we start our negotiation at $120. This price reflects both the quality of the product and its significance to you. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance Alice might be willing to go lower. By rejecting the initial offer, you open the door for further negotiation and the possibility of getting a better price."
