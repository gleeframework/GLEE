"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. You want to save as much money as possible, and $1,100,000 is still above your target of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation.  The message also shows that you are interested in reaching a deal, but are firm about your price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, even with a slight reduction. We want to save as much money as possible, and $1,050,000 is still above our target of $1,200,000. Rejecting the offer allows us to counter again and potentially reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,050,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will still be valuable to me."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Alice's offer. However, it remains within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation. The message emphasizes the value you see in the product while being firm on your price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000 even. I believe this is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has dropped her price, $1,000,000 is still more than we are comfortable spending. We are aiming for a price below our maximum of $1,200,000, and this offer is still above that. Rejecting the offer allows us to continue negotiating and hopefully reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. I'm hoping we can close a deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows a strong commitment to reaching an agreement while staying within your budget. It's a slight increase from your previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. The message highlights the fairness of the offer and emphasizes the desire for a successful deal."
