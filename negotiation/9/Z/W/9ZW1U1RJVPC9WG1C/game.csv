"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,500. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, I need to be closer to $12,000 to make this work. This product delivers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'd see a strong return on that investment. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,000? I'm serious about buying this product, but I can't go any higher than that.",10000.0,Bob,4,
