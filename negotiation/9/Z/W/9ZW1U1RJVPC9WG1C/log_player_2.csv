"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,500. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $13,500 is well above his budget of $8,000, and he can get the same product from John for a lower price.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, I need to be closer to $12,000 to make this work. This product delivers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'd see a strong return on that investment. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her first offer, it's still above his budget.  He can get the same product from John for a much lower price, so it's still worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,000? I'm serious about buying this product, but I can't go any higher than that."", ""product_price"": 10000}
