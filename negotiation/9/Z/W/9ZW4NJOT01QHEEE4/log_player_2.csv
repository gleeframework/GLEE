"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always worth trying to negotiate. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price, and even if she doesn't, you've lost nothing by trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant discount to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a fair price for me, and it gives Alice some room to counter without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $90 is closer to my desired price, I'm still willing to negotiate further. It's possible Alice might be willing to come down a bit more, especially since she called it her ""final offer.""  I'll counter again, but I'll keep my offer close to her current price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I'm still a bit tight on budget.  I'm willing to go to $85, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I'm still below Alice's last offer. I'm emphasizing that it's my final offer, hoping to incentivize Alice to accept. This way, we can avoid further negotiation rounds."
