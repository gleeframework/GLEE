{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by giving Bob a small incentive to consider buying. I'm aiming for a profit, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,500? That's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is still less than I initially hoped for, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Since we've gone back and forth several rounds, and John is a reliable buyer, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to avoid further negotiation."
