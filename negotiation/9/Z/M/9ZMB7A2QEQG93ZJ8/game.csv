"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,500? That's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
