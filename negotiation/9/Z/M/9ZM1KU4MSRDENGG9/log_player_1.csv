Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still being a good starting point for potentially getting a decent price.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and try to get as close to my desired price as possible.  If the negotiation doesn't go well, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range."

I'm countering with $130. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but it's still lower than my initial price of $150. Hopefully, this compromise will be attractive enough for Bob to accept while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject his offer and counteroffer again, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm offering $115. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate further. Hopefully, this offer will be agreeable to Bob and we can finalize the deal."
