Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll try to counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  $9,500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? I think this is a fair compromise that will let us both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10000}
