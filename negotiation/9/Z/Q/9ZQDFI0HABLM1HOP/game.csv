"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider coming down to $850,000? I think that's a fair price that considers its value to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad to hear you think it's valuable. However, $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and reflects the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $925,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $925,000, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value.",975000.0,Alice,5,
