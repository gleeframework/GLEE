"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  He has a maximum budget of $12,000, and Alice's offer is already lower than that. By rejecting, he can potentially get a better price through negotiation or move on to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. By offering $8,000, he is starting the negotiation with a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move that will likely encourage Alice to counter with a price closer to his desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer of $9,000. He's still aiming for a lower price and has several rounds left to negotiate. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if he can get a better deal, especially since he has the fallback option of buying from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer slightly from $8,000 to $8,500. This demonstrates that he's willing to negotiate but also shows that he's not going to settle for a price that's too high.  This counteroffer is still a good deal for him, but it's also closer to Alice's last offer, potentially leading to a quicker agreement."
