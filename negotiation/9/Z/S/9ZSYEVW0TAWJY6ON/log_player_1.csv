Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $90 gives Bob a $10 discount (making it more enticing than rejection), while you secure a $10 profit above your minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
