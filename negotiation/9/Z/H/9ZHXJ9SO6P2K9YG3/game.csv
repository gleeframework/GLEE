"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is simply too low for me to accept. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to meet my minimum requirements. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. How about $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price.  $11,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,250, which is a fair compromise.  It's a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target.  Let's close this deal!",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  I'm ready to meet you halfway - how about $12,000 even?  That's a win-win for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
