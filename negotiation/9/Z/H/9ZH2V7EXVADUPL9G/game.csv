"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
