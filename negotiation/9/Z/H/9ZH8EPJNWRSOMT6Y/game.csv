"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to at least get $13,500 for this product.  This is still a great price considering its value.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
