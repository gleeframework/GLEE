{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him some incentive to accept.  It also leaves room for negotiation if he counter-offers. At the same time, it's significantly higher than my minimum threshold of $15,000, ensuring a good profit.  I'll be ready to negotiate further if needed, but I'll also keep John in mind as a potential buyer if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate you considering me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I am interested in selling to Bob, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in price. I'll proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to at least get $13,500 for this product.  This is still a great price considering its value.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's also a compromise from my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but it also maintains my position of not selling for less than $13,500. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to come up a bit closer to my price."
