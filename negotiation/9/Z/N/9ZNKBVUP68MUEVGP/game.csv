"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. I could consider a price of $1,050,000.  This offer reflects a willingness to find middle ground while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $950,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions. My final offer is $1,000,000. This takes into account the value you see while respecting the product's worth.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
