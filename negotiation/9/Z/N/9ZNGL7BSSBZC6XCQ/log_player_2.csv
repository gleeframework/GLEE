"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I'm asking for $1,150,000, a price that reflects its true worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I'm not comfortable exceeding that price.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,000,000.  That's my absolute limit.  If you're willing to come down to that price, I'm ready to buy.  Otherwise, I might have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for this product.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While there's a chance Bob could negotiate a lower price in the following rounds, it's not guaranteed. Buying from John at his fixed price of $1,000,000 provides a certain and cost-effective solution."
