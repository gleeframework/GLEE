,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $800000 is a bit too low for me at this point. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $900000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's keep the conversation going.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While I see your point, $850000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I think $875000 is a fair compromise that allows for a smooth deal. This price reflects the value of the product and offers a good return for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm sure we can reach a deal that works for both of us.  $860000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a little more to make this worthwhile.
