"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to go up to $9,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle at $10,000. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with it, I'll have to sell to another buyer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
