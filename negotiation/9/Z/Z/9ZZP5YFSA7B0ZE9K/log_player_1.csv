Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $500,000 if he buys from you at the right price.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  You want to aim for a price that's profitable for you (significantly above $1,000,000) but also appealing enough for Bob to choose your offer over losing out on the deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a rare chance to acquire an asset with such high potential."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message is straightforward and emphasizes the product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 offers a substantial profit margin for you while still leaving Bob with a potential $150,000 gain. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" subtly implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate, but always keep your bottom line ($1,000,000) in mind.
* **Relationship Matters:**  While maximizing profit is key, consider your long-term relationship with Bob. A deal that's overly aggressive might damage future interactions."
