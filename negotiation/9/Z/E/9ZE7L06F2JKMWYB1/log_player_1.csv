"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your operations."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  While we know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, starting significantly higher than his perceived value allows room for negotiation and potentially reveals how much he's truly willing to pay. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason (""value and potential"") provides context for the high price and avoids simply stating a number. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  We always have the option to walk away and sell to John for our minimum acceptable price. This knowledge empowers our negotiation position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort in valuing the product. However, my budget is limited, and I am looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose an offer of $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is already quite close to our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  We have room to negotiate and try to secure a better deal.  We'll use our next counteroffer to signal that we're getting closer to our bottom line but are still open to a reasonable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  While I'm motivated to find a solution, the value this product brings is substantial.  I could consider closing the deal for $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:** We significantly decreased our price from $2,300,000 to $1,900,000, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Our Minimum:** This price is still comfortably above our $1,500,000 minimum and gives us room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:**  We reiterate the ""value"" point to remind Bob why the price isn't dropping as quickly as he might hope. 
* **Call to Action:**  By saying ""closing the deal,"" we hint that this price is getting us closer to a final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed it carefully and would like to propose an offer of $1,600,000 for the product. This price aligns better with my current budget while still allowing me to acquire the necessary asset. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away if we push too hard. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
