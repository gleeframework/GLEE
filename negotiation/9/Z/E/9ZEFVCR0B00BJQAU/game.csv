"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds immense value, potentially worth far more than $1000000 to the right person. I'm confident it can be a game-changer for the right individual. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1500000. This is a one-time offer.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up at $1000000, but I'm hoping you see the potential here.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
