"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $150? This way, you get a great deal and I still get a fair price.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to counteroffer at $140. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Bob,4,
