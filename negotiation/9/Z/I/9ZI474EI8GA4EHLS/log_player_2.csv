"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's best to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's new offer is closer to his budget, he can likely still get a better deal.  He should reject and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $11,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11500 isn't quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $12250? That's a fair price that's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is very close to his goal price.  Alice is getting closer to his budget, but still a bit higher.  He should reject and try to get the price down a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you getting closer to my budget.  However, $12,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute limit.  If you accept this, we can close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
