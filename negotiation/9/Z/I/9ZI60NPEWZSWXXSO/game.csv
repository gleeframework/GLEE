"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $80 is too low for me. This product is high-quality and worth a good investment. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit higher than what I had in mind. Would you consider $95? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. How about we settle at $130? That's a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but my budget is really tight. I could potentially stretch to $110, but that's absolutely my limit.",110.0,Bob,6,
