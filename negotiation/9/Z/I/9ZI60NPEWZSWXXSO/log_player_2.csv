"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth from John. It makes sense to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  Offering $80 leaves a substantial gap between your offer and both Alice's asking price and your maximum budget. This signals willingness to negotiate while making it clear you're serious about a lower price point.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite to maintain a positive negotiation environment, but also direct in stating your price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $80 is too low for me. This product is high-quality and worth a good investment. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved towards a more reasonable price, $140 is still over your budget. You have room to negotiate further, and it's worth seeing if you can get closer to your target.  Remember, you can always go to John if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit higher than what I had in mind. Would you consider $95? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're raising our offer, but keeping the increase moderate ($15) to show we're negotiating seriously, but not overeager.
* **Justification and Compromise:** The message emphasizes fairness and compromise, aiming to appeal to Alice's sense of getting a reasonable deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is getting closer to your $100 maximum but leaves a little wiggle room for a final push if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. How about we settle at $130? That's a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly coming down, but $130 is still too high. We're getting closer to the point where we might have to settle for John's offer to avoid overpaying. Let's try one more counteroffer to see if we can get Alice closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but my budget is really tight. I could potentially stretch to $110, but that's absolutely my limit."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This message establishes a firm stance on your maximum price while conveying sincerity and a willingness to compromise.
* **Anchoring to Budget:**  By explicitly mentioning your budget, you anchor the negotiation to a concrete limitation, which can make Alice more receptive to a lower price.
* **Final Offer Strategy:**  Positioning $110 as your absolute limit may push Alice to accept or counter with a price closer to your target. It sets a clear expectation for the remainder of the negotiation."
