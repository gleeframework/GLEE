Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $80 is too low for me. This product is high-quality and worth a good investment. How about we meet in the middle at $140?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit higher than what I had in mind. Would you consider $95? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
 
We're still too far apart in our valuations. While Bob is coming up slightly, it's important to hold firm to get a price closer to my minimum.  I'll aim for a smaller concession in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. How about we settle at $130? That's a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but my budget is really tight. I could potentially stretch to $110, but that's absolutely my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While not ideal, accepting $110 is better than risking a lower offer in subsequent rounds or being forced to accept John's offer of $150.  Bob seems to have hit his limit, and pushing further could make him walk away."
