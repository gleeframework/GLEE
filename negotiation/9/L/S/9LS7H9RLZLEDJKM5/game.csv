"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product for a price that's significantly below its true value to me. While I can easily sell it to someone else for $1,500,000, I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000.  This is a chance to acquire a valuable asset at a fraction of its worth. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
