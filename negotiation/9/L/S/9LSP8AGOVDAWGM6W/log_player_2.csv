Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's far above my budget and even above her own valuation. I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower, closer to my budget limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you have a tighter budget, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $10,000 for the product. How about we meet at $9,000?

Alice is coming down, but $9,000 is still too high. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my limit, hoping she's willing to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to get at least $9,500 for the product. How about we meet at $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

Alice seems firm on a price above my limit. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation. I'll go with my backup plan and buy from John for $8,000."
