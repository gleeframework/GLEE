"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,800,000. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,800,000.  It's worth exploring if we can reach a compromise that's closer to my initial asking price. There are still 9 rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This reflects the unique value of this product, and I believe it's a fair price. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm not willing to sell at such a low price, and I still have 6 rounds left to potentially negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for this product. Given its unique qualities, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. With only 4 rounds left, the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob are diminishing.  It's time to take the sure thing. John is offering my minimum price, and selling to him ensures I get at least my minimum value."
