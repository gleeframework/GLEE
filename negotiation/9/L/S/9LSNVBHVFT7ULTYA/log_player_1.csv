Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation.  I'm offering a price significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, considering his value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's higher than John's offer, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. It's still a good deal for me, but also shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  He's come up to my counteroffer, and I'm satisfied with the price.  It's a good deal for me, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
