Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about $99? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very stubbornly clinging close to her asking price.  At this point, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $99, and it's not worth the risk of her digging in further and causing me to potentially lose out on the product entirely. John offers a guaranteed price of $100, so it makes more sense to cut my losses and go with the certainty of John's offer."
