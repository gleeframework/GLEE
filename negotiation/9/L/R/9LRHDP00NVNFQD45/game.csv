"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me and still leaves you a significant profit margin. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit while staying within my limit. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which still allows me to recoup a substantial portion of my investment. This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a strong offer for both of us. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still hoping to find a deal closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This would allow you a healthy profit margin while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
