Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $170, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message implies I'm open to negotiation, which will encourage Bob to counteroffer.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum, so I have leverage to walk away if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I am only able to pay up to $120 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's willing to negotiate.  I can likely get a better price by counteroffering.
* **John as Leverage:**  I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  $120 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?  I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($150) and Bob's offer ($120). This shows a compromise and makes the offer seem fair.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, implying that even at $135, it's a good deal. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I believe I can only afford to pay $125 for the product. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited Upside:**  While I could counteroffer again, it's likely that further negotiation won't lead to a price much higher than $125. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $150. This is a better outcome than risking further negotiation with Bob, which could potentially lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
