"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and her offer is significantly higher than the product's value to her. By rejecting her initial offer, you might encourage her to propose a lower price."
