"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me some room to negotiate and still be profitable.
* **Positive message:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for negotiation:** The price is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's not unreasonably high. This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation without immediately triggering a rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am only able to pay up to $120 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could accept it and get some money, it wouldn't be a good deal for me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a good price for both of us, and it's still below what I could get from another buyer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm offering a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, but still below what I could get from John. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm giving Bob a reason to accept by emphasizing the benefit of a good deal and referencing John's offer as a point of comparison.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I'm willing to meet you at $130 for the product. I hope this offer works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm choosing to reject the offer and continue negotiating in the hopes of securing a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my goal of $150 in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, $130 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $135. This is a fair compromise, and it's a better price than you'd get elsewhere.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm raising the price slightly, but still within a reasonable range. 
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I'm framing this as a compromise to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Competition:** I'm reminding Bob that he's getting a better price than he could find elsewhere. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm staying positive and encouraging a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to pay $132 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a little too low. I'm not yet comfortable settling for $132.  I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get a slightly higher price in the remaining rounds.  I still believe I can get a better deal and I'm determined to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $132 just isn't quite working for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $134? This would be a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident we can finalize this today!"", ""product_price"": 134}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm proposing a price that's right in the middle of our last two offers. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise.
* **Positive reinforcement:** I'm reminding Bob that a deal is within reach and emphasizing the positive outcome.
* **Sense of urgency:** I'm adding a touch of urgency (""finalize this today!"") to encourage Bob to make a decision.  
* **Confidence:**  I'm expressing confidence in a successful outcome to maintain a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've done my best to meet you halfway. I'm willing to pay $133 for the product. I hope this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $133. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $133
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, it's unlikely that I'll be able to get a better price from Bob.  He's clearly not willing to go higher than $133, and while that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. 

Rather than risk ending up with a lower profit or a stalemate, I'm choosing to sell to John for $150. This ensures I achieve my desired profit and secures a deal without further negotiation."
