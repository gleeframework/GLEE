{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **For you:** This price is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **For Bob:** This price is still below the value he places on the product ($1,200,000), leaving him room for a perceived good deal.

By offering this price, you increase your chances of Bob accepting while still securing a substantial profit. If Bob rejects, you can confidently sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
