Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The price is significantly lower than the product's value to Bob ($15,000), giving him room to feel like he's getting a good deal while still allowing you to potentially earn more. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is more than your minimum, you can likely get a better price.  Bob is clearly interested and acknowledges the product's value to him.  This gives you leverage for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Splits the difference:** It's halfway between your previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still being profitable.
* **Offers a clear justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and highlights the fairness of the offer, making it more likely for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good compromise.  While it's less than your ideal price, it's still a profit of $2,000 over your minimum.  Furthermore, continuing to negotiate could lead to further price drops or a stalemate, making it risky to reject his offer. It's best to secure the sale at a good price rather than potentially lose out on the deal entirely."
