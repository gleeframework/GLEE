"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is truly unique and has the potential to generate significant returns beyond the price you've offered.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,150,000.  I believe this price point better reflects its inherent worth.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
