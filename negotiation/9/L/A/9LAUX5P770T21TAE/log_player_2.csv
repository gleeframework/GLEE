"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500.  This is a great price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get a good return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer of $13,500 is less than your $15,000 maximum and saves you money compared to buying from John."
