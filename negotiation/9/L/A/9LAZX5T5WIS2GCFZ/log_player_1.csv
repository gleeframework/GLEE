"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a bold move, but it's important to set a high starting point to maximize potential profit.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium for the product. 

If he rejects, I can adjust my offer downwards in subsequent rounds based on his counteroffer.  If he accepts, I've secured a very good price.  

This strategy also leaves room for potential negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's level of interest and his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is better than my minimum acceptable price, it's significantly lower than my desired profit.  Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Continue negotiation:**  I can explore if Bob is willing to compromise and meet me somewhere in the middle.  There's still room for a higher price.
* **Gain information:**  Bob's counteroffer gives me valuable insight into his perceived value of the product.  This helps me determine the best strategy for future rounds.

Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, but I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. There's still potential to earn more with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a counteroffer of $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's counteroffer.  

Here's the reasoning:

* **Middle ground:** This price is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's. It shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Still profitable:** It's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I'm still making a profit.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and see if he's closer to my desired price.

If Bob rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy further in the next round, but this offer allows for a potential deal while maintaining a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject this offer and continue to negotiate with Bob. 

Here's why:

* **Room for improvement:**  There's still a significant gap between Bob's offer and my desired price. I believe I can push for a higher price with further negotiation.
* **Information gathering:**  Bob's persistent low offers are giving me valuable insight into his perceived value of the product.  This is helping me refine my negotiation strategy.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm still within the first half of the negotiation rounds.  I have time to see if Bob is willing to come up in his offer.

Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a secure option, but I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a counteroffer of $1,600,000. Here's the strategy behind this move:

* **Compromise, but not too much:**  This offer is a slight decrease from my previous counteroffer of $1,750,000, showing flexibility but still maintaining a strong position.
* **Staying above minimum:** This price remains above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I'm still making a profit.
* **Testing Bob's limits:** This offer is meant to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price.  If he rejects, I'll know he's likely not going to go much higher.

The negotiation is getting more serious, and I'm trying to strike a balance between securing a good deal and not risking losing Bob entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to settle for that. I have a few reasons for rejecting this offer:

* **Still Room for Improvement:**  While it's a significant jump from Bob's previous offer, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can continue to negotiate and push for a higher value.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** We are now in the middle of the negotiation rounds. There is still time for Bob to come up on his offer, especially as he is getting closer to my minimum.
* **Risk Assessment:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed profit, but it's too early to settle.  Bob may be willing to come closer to my desired price, and I want to explore that possibility. 

This round is crucial. It's a tightrope walk between holding out for a better deal and potentially losing out on the sale altogether.  I need to carefully consider my next counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a crucial round, as we are getting very close to the end of the negotiation. I'm making a counteroffer of $1,500,000. Here's the strategy behind this move:

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final compromise. It's my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Strong Signal:** By offering my minimum, I'm sending a strong signal to Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I won't go below this price.
* **Time Pressure:** We're nearing the end of the rounds. If Bob rejects this offer, I might have to sell to John, which is less ideal but still a guaranteed profit.

This offer is a risky move, but it's a calculated risk. I'm hoping that Bob realizes the urgency of the situation and accepts this price. If he doesn't, I have a backup plan with John, but I'm still hoping to get the best possible deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough decision, as Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. However, we are in round 8, and there are only two rounds left.  Considering the following:

* **Time is running out:**  With only two rounds left, I risk losing the deal entirely if I continue to reject Bob's offer. 
* **No guarantee of higher offer:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer in the next round. He might stick to $1,450,000 or even lower his offer.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed profit, and while it's not my ideal price, it's a safe and secure outcome. 

Given the time pressure and the lack of guarantee for a higher offer, I've decided to sell to John. While I'm not thrilled about the lower price, it's the most sensible decision to secure a profit and avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether."
