I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter in the next round."
