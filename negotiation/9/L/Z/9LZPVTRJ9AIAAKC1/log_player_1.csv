{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum, but not too high that it would scare Bob off. It also gives Bob a chance to counter-offer, allowing us to negotiate. I'm confident that I can either get a good price from Bob, or I can always fall back on John's $120 offer."
