"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. You should try to negotiate a lower price since you know you have the option to buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) leaves room for negotiation while still being within a reasonable range of Alice's valuation. This approach aims to maximize potential savings while acknowledging that Alice is seeking a price closer to $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though.  How about $9,500? This is a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is closer to your budget, it's still above what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation. You can try to meet in the middle or push closer to your $8,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer aims to split the difference between your previous offer ($8,000) and Alice's counteroffer ($9,500).  This shows willingness to compromise while still striving for a price closer to your target."
