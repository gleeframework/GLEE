Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $750,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While we could continue negotiating, accepting Bob's offer of $825,000 is a strong deal. It exceeds our minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and gives us a significant profit margin. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better outcome, and we risk Bob walking away."
