"Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget ($8,000) and even lower than the price offered by John. Accepting her offer saves you $1,500 compared to buying from John. There's no need to risk further negotiation, as the current offer is already advantageous."
