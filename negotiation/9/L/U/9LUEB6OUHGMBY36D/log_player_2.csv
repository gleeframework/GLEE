# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe its worth exceeds $1,000,000, but I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
