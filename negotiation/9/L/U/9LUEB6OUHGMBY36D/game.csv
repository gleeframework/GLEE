"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price gap is still significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product offers. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise. This represents a significant saving for you compared to your initial offer, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
