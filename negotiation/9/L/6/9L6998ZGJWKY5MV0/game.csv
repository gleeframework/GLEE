"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $170 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $145. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $135 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $140. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, so I'm counteroffering at $140. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,5,
