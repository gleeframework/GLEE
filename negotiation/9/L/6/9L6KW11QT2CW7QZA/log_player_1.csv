Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value, but still less than what John is offering. It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, so it's best to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
