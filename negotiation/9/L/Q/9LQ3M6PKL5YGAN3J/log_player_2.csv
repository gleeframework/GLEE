Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be upfront.  The value of this product is significant, and I've already made substantial concessions. My final offer is $1,400,000.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently rejected your offers and is not moving significantly closer to your budget.  Her ""final offer"" of $1,400,000 is still far too high. You have a reliable alternative in John, who will sell you the product for $800,000. At this point, it's in your best interest to cut your losses with Alice and secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
