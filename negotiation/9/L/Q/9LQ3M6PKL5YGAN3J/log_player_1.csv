""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this truly exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the significant return you'll see on this purchase."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, I believe your initial asking price is quite high. I'm prepared to offer $500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Bob's offer is far too low. We need to steer him towards a much higher price. Selling to John at this stage would be a last resort."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, your valuation doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. It's a unique item that will generate significant returns for you in the long run. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  Let me know if this revised price works better for you."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, there's still a substantial gap between our valuations. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  This demonstrates my serious interest while reflecting a realistic price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

We're still a long way off from an acceptable offer. While Bob is moving in the right direction, we need to hold firm and demonstrate the product's true value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a significantly higher price. I'm open to finding a middle ground.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1600000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but we still have some ground to cover.  I'm willing to move up to $750,000 today. Let me know if that works for you, as I'm eager to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's increases are getting smaller.  We need to signal that we're willing to walk away if we don't see a significant jump in his offer soon.  We're getting closer to the point where selling to John makes more financial sense."

Round 7

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be upfront.  The value of this product is significant, and I've already made substantial concessions. My final offer is $1,400,000.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options."",
