Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to your target, but it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. You have only 3 rounds left, and you are getting closer to the point where it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John for $800,000 is a guaranteed deal and will allow you to save money and avoid further negotiation."
