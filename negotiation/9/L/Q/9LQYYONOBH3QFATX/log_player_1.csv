Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it holds significant value, even more than this asking price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 provides a safety net. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting high leaves a sliver of room for Bob to negotiate down, though any offer below $15,000 would be accepted.
* **Psychological Pricing:** $14,999 feels like a significant discount compared to an even $15,000 and might make Bob more receptive. 

This strategy aims to get the highest price from Bob while ensuring the product is sold at a price that benefits Alice."
