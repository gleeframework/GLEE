"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500,  a price that's fair for both of us. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
