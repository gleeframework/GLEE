Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value of $15,000. It allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for me to lower the price if necessary. 
* **Positive message:** I'm using positive language to create a sense of opportunity and value for Bob. 

This approach aims to:

* **Start high:**  This gives me the most leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Be enthusiastic:** I'm trying to gauge Bob's interest and potentially influence his perception of the product's value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's potential value:** I need to consider how valuable this product might be to Bob. If I think it's worth more than $20,000 to him, I might start even higher.
* **John's offer:**  I need to keep John's offer in mind. If negotiations with Bob drag on, I can always fall back to John's offer to ensure I get at least $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, it's not worth risking a protracted negotiation that might lead to a lower price or no sale at all.  Since I have a guaranteed alternative with John at $15,000, accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and secure sale."
