"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,500. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident this product is worth the investment, and I'm willing to come down slightly to $11,200. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true value. What do you say?",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $11,200 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,850? This would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",10850.0,Bob,4,
