"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'd be happy to make a purchase at that price.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $120. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $200. I think this is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer of $200. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $180? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'd be happy to make a purchase at that price.",180.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $180. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $220. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",220.0,Alice,5,
