Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $760,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000.

This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're eager to close the deal, Bob. However, $777,500 is still a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to consider one more counteroffer, but I need to see a bit more movement from your side. I'll meet you at $795,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is holding firm at $795,000 and indicating she may walk away. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal.  Accepting at $795,000 secures a good price below John's offer."
