"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $950,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen to buy but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about we settle on $760,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $760,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you halfway, but I need to see some movement from your side. I'll meet you at $795,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to close this deal. How about we split the difference and settle at $777,500?",777500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're eager to close the deal, Bob. However, $777,500 is still a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to consider one more counteroffer, but I need to see a bit more movement from your side. I'll meet you at $795,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",795000.0,Alice,7,
