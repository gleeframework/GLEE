"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good price, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $87.50?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",87.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $87.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference at $86. I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",86.0,Bob,4,
