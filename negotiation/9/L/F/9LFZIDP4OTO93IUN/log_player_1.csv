Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  $90 allows for some wiggle room in case Bob wants to counteroffer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $100 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While $85 is closer to my minimum of $100, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $100 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good price, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $87.50?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $85 and my previous offer of $90.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  $87.50 is still above my minimum of $100, so I'm not losing out on too much profit if Bob accepts.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** Highlighting that this price is fair for both of us could encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $87.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference at $86. I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $86 is only $4 away from my minimum acceptable price, I'm concerned about being pushed down further in future rounds.
* **Time is Money:** The negotiation is taking time, and I'm not confident of getting a much better offer from Bob.
* **Secure Profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a $100 profit, which is a safer and quicker option compared to continuing negotiations with Bob."
