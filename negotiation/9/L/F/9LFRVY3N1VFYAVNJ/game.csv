"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, but I'm really not able to go higher. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1,100,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still very interested in selling the product to you. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I believe the product holds. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to pay $900,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering the value we both see in it. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering your offer of $900,000, I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
