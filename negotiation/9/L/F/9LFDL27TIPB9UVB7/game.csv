"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I know it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This price still allows me to make a profit while offering you a significant discount from my initial price.  What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. I'm glad we're getting closer.  To be honest, $12,500 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. While $10,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit short of my target.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $11,250.  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I have to be upfront â€“ my absolute maximum budget for this product is $10,000. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
