"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I know it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can push for a better deal.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value he'll gain.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation by inviting Bob to share his thoughts. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while remaining open to negotiation and ensuring Bob doesn't immediately reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he has shown interest and willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic counteroffer:** I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and keep the negotiation going. I will use the next round to make a counteroffer that is more appealing to both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This price still allows me to make a profit while offering you a significant discount from my initial price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by offering a lower price than my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Price:**  $12,500 is a compromise that allows me to earn more than Bob's offer, while still being within a reasonable range for him.
* **Open Ended:** I'm ending with a question to encourage further discussion and potentially move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. I'm glad we're getting closer.  To be honest, $12,500 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:** While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired earnings.
* **Strategic Play:** Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round and potentially push the price even higher.
* **Limited Time:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's important to use each round strategically to maximize my potential profit.

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer in the next round, I can potentially secure a price closer to my desired $12,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. While $10,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit short of my target.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $11,250.  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** I'm offering a price exactly in the middle of my last offer ($12,500) and Bob's latest offer ($10,000). This shows a willingness to meet halfway and encourages a feeling of fairness. 
* **Clear Value Proposition:** I re-emphasize the value for Bob, highlighting how this price still gives him a good deal.
* **Direct Question:**  I end with a direct question to prompt a response and keep the negotiation moving forward. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground, demonstrating flexibility while staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I have to be upfront â€“ my absolute maximum budget for this product is $10,000. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** We are down to the 6th round, and each round is valuable. 
* **Bob's Firm Stance:** Bob has stated his absolute maximum budget, indicating he is unlikely to budge further. 
* **John's Offer:** John offers a guaranteed $15,000, significantly higher than Bob's maximum offer. 

Given the limited time remaining, Bob's unyielding stance, and John's guaranteed higher price, selling to John is the most advantageous decision. This ensures a secure sale at my desired minimum and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
