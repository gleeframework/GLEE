"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the market value, I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident it will bring you substantial value.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value I'm getting, I'm confident that $800,000 is a fair price for both of us.  This offer is my final price, and I'm prepared to move on if we can't reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
