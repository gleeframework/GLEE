Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while not being overly aggressive. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** $12,000 is a good starting point, allowing for potential negotiation upwards.
* **Keep the negotiation open:**  The message is positive and invites Bob to engage, keeping the door open for further negotiation. 
* **Have a fallback option:** The knowledge that John is willing to pay $15,000 provides leverage in case Bob rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my desired profit and even lower than my perceived value of the product.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Negotiate further:** I can attempt to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me the power to walk away if Bob becomes unreasonable.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm keeping the negotiation open and increasing the likelihood of a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:** This counteroffer represents a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the ""fair deal"" aspect, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Close the gap:** The counteroffer significantly narrows the price difference, increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting Bob's offer immediately, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a sale and have other options.
* **Maintain a positive negotiation tone:** The message is constructive and avoids aggressive language, keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my desired profit and my perceived value of the product.  I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer again for the following reasons:

* **Negotiation leverage:** I'm not desperate to sell the product at this price. By rejecting, I demonstrate that I'm willing to walk away, potentially forcing Bob to increase his offer.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price or at least a more reasonable offer.  
* **Safeguard my profits:** Selling for $9,000 would significantly impact my profit margin and is not a desirable outcome.

The risk of rejecting Bob's offer is that the negotiation might break down completely. However, the potential for a better deal and the knowledge that I have a backup buyer (John) gives me the confidence to reject and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $10,500? This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:** This counteroffer is a significant concession from my previous offer of $11,000 but still higher than Bob's last offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my profit margin. 
* **Message:** The message is firm but still polite and reiterates the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's budget. It emphasizes the ""fair compromise"" aspect, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Make a final attempt:** This counteroffer is my last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. 
* **Show firmness:** By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Set a clear deadline:** The message implies that this is my final offer, potentially pushing Bob to consider it seriously.

This counteroffer is a calculated risk. There's a chance Bob might still reject it, but it's a better gamble than selling at a significantly lower price or walking away completely without further negotiation."
