"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value this product holds, $950,000 is a bit higher than my current budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and the market value.  Let me know if you're open to this offer.",800000.0,Bob,2,
