"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's below her value, it's still above what the product is worth to Bob.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her first one, it's still above Bob's maximum price point.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. He should still consider buying from John, but it might be worth seeing if he can negotiate further with Alice before committing to that decision."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This price would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is $1,250,000. This is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. While negotiating further with Alice might lead to a slightly lower price, the risk of her rejecting the offer and ending up with no product is too high. John is a guaranteed sale at a price that fits within Bob's budget."
