"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This price is closer to what I'm comfortable paying, and it would still be a good deal for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This price would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.
