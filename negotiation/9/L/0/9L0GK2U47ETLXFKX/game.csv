"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you consider something around $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  $15,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $13,000? That's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,6,
