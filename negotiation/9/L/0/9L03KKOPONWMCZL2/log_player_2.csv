"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start at a price of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is way over his budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000, saving him $2,000."
