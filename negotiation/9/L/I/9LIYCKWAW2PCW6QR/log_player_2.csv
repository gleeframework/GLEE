"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:

While $110 is closer to your desired price, you can still try to negotiate further. You have room to go lower without exceeding your $120 limit.  Let's see if you can get a better deal!"
