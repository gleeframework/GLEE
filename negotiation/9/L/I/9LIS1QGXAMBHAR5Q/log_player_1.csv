{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired price range. I'll reject this offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $105? This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth $150 to you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see your point, Alice. How about we settle at $97? That's a fair compromise in my opinion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $97 is very close to my desired price range. While I could try to push for a bit more, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer will guarantee a decent profit, and it's likely the best outcome at this stage."
