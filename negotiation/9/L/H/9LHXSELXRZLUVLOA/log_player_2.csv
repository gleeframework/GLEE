Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,600,000? That gives you a good deal while ensuring I can still make a profit. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.
