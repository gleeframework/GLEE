Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept $1,400,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,600,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to me and allows us both to make a reasonable profit.  I believe this is a good compromise, let's see if we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,450,000 is closer to my minimum than before, I still believe we can find a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and push for a price closer to $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, I still need to be closer to my desired price point.

I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your desired price point, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to offer $1,525,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit and reach an agreement. Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call. Bob is offering $1,525,000, which is just a bit above my minimum of $1,500,000. While I'd like to push for a higher price, I'm worried that if I reject this offer, he might back out entirely. Given the limited rounds remaining, it's wiser to accept this offer and secure the sale."
