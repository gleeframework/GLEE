"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, I'll see how much he values the product and adjust my price accordingly.  I'm confident I can get a better deal than John's offer, but I'm also aware of the time limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$700,000 is far too low.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my initial price. I still believe I can get a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm dropping my price a bit, but I'm still holding firm on getting a substantial profit. This counteroffer shows Bob I'm serious about a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for a drastically low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$600,000 is still far too low. While time is running out, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round and continue to gauge Bob's interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm dropping my price again, but I'm sticking to John's offer as my floor. This shows Bob I'm serious about a deal, but I'm also aware of the time pressure.  If Bob rejects again, I'll have to reconsider my options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $550,000 is tempting, I'm still not convinced Bob won't go higher. I'll make a counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm running out of time, but I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm dropping the price one more time, but this is my final offer.  I'm confident Bob values the product enough to meet me at this price. If he doesn't, I'll have to go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm running out of time and Bob's offers are getting increasingly low. I've made significant concessions, but it's clear he's not willing to meet me halfway. To avoid risking getting nothing, I'll take John's offer and secure a guaranteed $1,000,000."
