"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value this product offers is truly significant, and $900,000 falls short of what I consider fair. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm also conscious of finding a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $975,000?  It's a slight adjustment on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value and my budget.",925000.0,Bob,6,
