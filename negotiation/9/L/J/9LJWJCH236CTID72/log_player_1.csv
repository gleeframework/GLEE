Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in a negotiation. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Considering Alternatives:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a more profitable outcome.
* **Not Too High:**  Setting the price at $150 isn't unreasonably high considering it's only $30 more than Bob values the product. This makes it more likely he'll consider the offer."
