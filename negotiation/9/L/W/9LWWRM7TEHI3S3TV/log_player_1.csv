"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($150). This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm offering $155, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable value ($150) and Bob's last offer ($140).  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm offering $145, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable value ($150) and Bob's last offer ($130).  I hope this compromise will be appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it's clear that we are unlikely to reach an agreement.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150."
