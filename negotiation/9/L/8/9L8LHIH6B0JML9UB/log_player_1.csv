Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a significantly higher price ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price well above my minimum.
* **Polite and open-ended:** The message is framed in a positive light, highlighting the product's value to Bob. The open-ended question encourages a dialogue and allows Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high. 

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to capitalize on the potential for a higher profit margin with Bob while still having the safety net of selling to John at my minimum acceptable price."
