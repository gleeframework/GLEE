"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to go above this price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  While $900,000 is a significant investment from your end, I'm confident this product will return even more value to you in the long run.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,025,000. This reflects the product's inherent value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,025,000 is still above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be more aggressive. I'm thinking $950,000. I'm confident that's a fair price, considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,200,000. I'm open to further negotiation, but I need to be within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
