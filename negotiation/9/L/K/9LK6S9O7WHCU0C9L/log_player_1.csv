Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $11,000. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to selling to John at $12,000.
* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Offering it at $8,000 or less would be a loss for you. 
* **Below Your Guaranteed Sale:** Offering it at $12,000 or more leaves no room for negotiation and doesn't incentivize Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $11,000 is a strong starting point. It's a price that could tempt Bob (as it's below your minimum) while still netting you a significant profit. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $11,000. He might try to negotiate further down. You'll need to decide your lowest acceptable price based on your priorities and how much you're willing to risk losing the sale to Bob."
