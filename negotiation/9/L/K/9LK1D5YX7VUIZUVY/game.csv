,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand it's valuable to you, but $15,000 is still more than I can comfortably pay.  How about we settle at $10,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. $10,000 is still quite low, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,000?  This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
