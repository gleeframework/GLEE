Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything below my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer of $110.  It's still a good deal for me, and it's clear he's willing to negotiate. I don't want to risk losing him completely."
