"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,
