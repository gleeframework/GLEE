"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that offer is too low, I'm open to finding a middle ground. Would you consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Could you do $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, this product is worth a significant amount to me, and going below $1,200,000 is difficult.  That being said, I value your interest and want to see if we can close this deal. My final offer is $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
