""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $5,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value, and it's the best I can do. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000.  While she might be willing to meet at $8,000 even, there's a risk she won't. It's in your best interest to secure the product at the best known price, which is John's offer of $8,000."
