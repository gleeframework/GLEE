"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is well above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $800,000. There's no reason to accept a deal that is significantly higher than his maximum limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good investment for you. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can get the product from John for $800,000, which is a better deal.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, but he shouldn't feel pressured to accept a price that's outside his comfort zone."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a strong value for me. I hope you'll consider this offer."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still not a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it for $950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're serious about acquiring this, I encourage you to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her previous offers, it's still above his budget. He can get the same product from John for $800,000, which is a significantly better deal. There's no point in accepting an offer that's above his maximum limit.

Even though Alice has said it's her final offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should continue to counteroffer and try to get a price that works for him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $925,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and a significant step up from my previous offer.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}
