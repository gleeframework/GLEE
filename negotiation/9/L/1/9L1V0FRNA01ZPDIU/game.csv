"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a price that's incredibly attractive given its value to you. I understand this product is worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,000,000. This represents a substantial saving for you, while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
