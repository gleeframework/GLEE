"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $120, but $100 is still above your ideal price point.
* **There's room for negotiation.** By rejecting, you signal that you're not desperate and open the door to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $90.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is reasonable:**  $90 is a significant decrease from $100, but it's still within a range that Alice might consider, especially as she wants to sell the product. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message is friendly and leaves room for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $95. This is a great price for a product worth $120 to you, so let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your ideal price point.** You're aiming for a price closer to $90.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Alice has already lowered her price, demonstrating her willingness to compromise.  This suggests a potential deal closer to your desired price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95.  I'm still a little higher than I'd like to be.  Would you be willing to go to $92?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant decrease:**  The offer is only $3 less than Alice's last one, showing a willingness to compromise without significantly lowering the offer.
* **Positive tone:** The message emphasizes a desire to close the deal and find a mutually beneficial price.
* **Focus on fairness:** Highlighting ""fair price for both of us"" reinforces the idea of a compromise."
