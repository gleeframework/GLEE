"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a much lower price from John. While negotiating with Alice might lead to a better price, there's no guarantee she'll come down enough to make it worthwhile.  It's safer to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price. Since he knows John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, that's the price he'll offer Alice. It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it sets a firm lower bound for the negotiation and signals Bob's willingness to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, but it's still higher than what he can get from John.  There's a good chance Alice might come down further, so it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if he can squeeze a better deal.  It's less risky to keep negotiating with Alice than to accept her current offer or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing that he's willing to pay a bit more, but still within his target range.  This counteroffer is a compromise between his initial $1,000,000 offer and Alice's $1,200,000 offer. This might entice Alice to accept, as she's likely getting closer to her desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now only $150,000 higher than John's price.  It's a good deal for Bob, considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice. There's a chance he could get a lower price by continuing to negotiate, but there's also a chance Alice might walk away.  At this point, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly lower price."
