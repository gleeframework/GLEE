,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a significant drop from my initial price.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which I feel is a fair compromise. This product will bring you a lot of value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  It's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. I'm confident we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but my price reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to let it go for $12,800, but that's my final offer.  I need to be fair to myself, and this is a very competitive price.",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $12,800 is still just a bit out of my budget. If you're willing to come down to $12,600, I'm ready to make the purchase. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the sale.",12600.0,Bob,6,
