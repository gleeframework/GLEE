Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $900,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but I believe it's still within a reasonable range that Bob might be willing to accept. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to maximize my earnings, so offering a higher price is logical.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $800,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects my offer, I'm guaranteed to make a good profit by selling to John.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** If Bob is interested but finds the price too high, I'm open to negotiating. I can always adjust the price downwards if necessary.

**Note:** This is just a starting point. I will need to analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
