"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $200. I think you'll find it's a steal at this rate! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $200 is significantly higher than both your maximum price ($100) and what John offers ($100). It's highly unlikely Alice will come down to a price you find acceptable in one step. It's worth negotiating, but be ready to walk away and buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's much closer to $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** Starting with $80 is a significant counter to Alice's $200.  It signals that you're serious about a much lower price point. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, you're trying to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to your desired range. 
* **Leaving Room:** This leaves space for Alice to counter and for some back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Prepared to Walk:**  Keep in mind that you have John's offer of $100 as a backup. Don't be afraid to walk away if Alice won't budge to a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $80 is pretty low, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice came down from $200, $160 is still significantly higher than both your $100 limit and John's offer. It's important to signal that you're serious about a much lower price point and that you have other options.  Continuing to negotiate is worthwhile for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving a little, but $160 is still much more than I had in mind. If you're willing to come down to $90, I'm ready to buy right now."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer, But Firm:**  Moving up to $90 shows you're willing to negotiate, but it's still well below her last offer and close to your limit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Adding ""ready to buy right now"" tries to create a sense of urgency and potential lost opportunity for Alice if she doesn't accept.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counter-offer helps gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be and if a deal within your budget is possible. You're still below John's offer, leaving room to negotiate slightly upwards if needed."
