Alice's counteroffer is a step in the right direction, but it's still too high.  I'm confident we can still negotiate a lower price, especially since I know Alice is willing to sell for $1,000,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,062,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1062500}

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is very close to my target price. It's only $9,000 above my desired price and with only one round left,  it's not worth risking going to John and paying $1,200,000 for the product.  I'll accept Alice's offer and get a good deal."
