"Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1075000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1062500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",1062500.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're trying to drive a hard bargain, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a profit, and $1062500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, but I can offer you a slight discount of $2500, so I'll counteroffer at $1072500. Let's see if we can shake on it!",1072500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1072500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we split the difference and settle at $1067500?  That's a fair compromise, and we can finally finalize this deal.",1067500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1067500. I'll meet you at $1070000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, and I think you'll agree it's worth it.",1070000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1070000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's compromise at $1068750.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal.",1068750.0,Bob,8,
