# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is a way too high of a price, even considering the product is worth more to Alice. I will counter-offer with a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate the offer, $1,100,000 falls quite a bit short of what I'm aiming for.  How about we meet halfway at $1,350,000?  This allows me a fair profit while still giving you a good deal on a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'll counter-offer again, hoping to find a compromise."
