Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate the offer, $1,100,000 falls quite a bit short of what I'm aiming for.  How about we meet halfway at $1,350,000?  This allows me a fair profit while still giving you a good deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
