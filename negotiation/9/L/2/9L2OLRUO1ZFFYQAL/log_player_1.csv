"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I know the product is worth to Bob. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value this product offers.  Let's split the difference.  My counteroffer is $1,050,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

While $975,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe we can negotiate higher. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,012,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while being within your budget. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1012500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. How about we try $950,000? It's the last offer I can make before I need to consider buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm not ready to give up just yet.  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, and it's worth trying before accepting John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me.  It's not a fair reflection of the value this product brings you. Let's compromise one last time.  I'm willing to come down to $987,500.  It's a fair price that shows we're both willing to meet in the middle. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 987500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm really struggling to justify the cost at $987,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I can only go as low as $962,500. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $962,500 is close to my minimum and I'm running out of time, I'm going to try one last counteroffer. It's a risk, but I'm hoping Bob is willing to budge a little more to secure the deal."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both at our limits here. However, I can't go any lower than $975,000. It's the best I can do, and it's still a great deal for you. If you're serious about this product, I believe we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
