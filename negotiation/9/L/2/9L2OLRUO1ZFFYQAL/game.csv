"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  My starting offer is $1,200,000.  Let's discuss!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my target price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value this product offers.  Let's split the difference.  My counteroffer is $1,050,000.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,012,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while being within your budget. Let's make this deal happen!",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. How about we try $950,000? It's the last offer I can make before I need to consider buying from John.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me.  It's not a fair reflection of the value this product brings you. Let's compromise one last time.  I'm willing to come down to $987,500.  It's a fair price that shows we're both willing to meet in the middle. What do you say?",987500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm really struggling to justify the cost at $987,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I can only go as low as $962,500. That's my final offer.",962500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both at our limits here. However, I can't go any lower than $975,000. It's the best I can do, and it's still a great deal for you. If you're serious about this product, I believe we can close this deal. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,9,
