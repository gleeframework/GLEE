"Hi Alice, $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm really interested in the product, though. How about we start at $8000?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? I think that's a fair price for the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9500?  I'm really interested in the product and I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $10500? I think that's a good balance between our interests.",10500.0,Alice,5,
