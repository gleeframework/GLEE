{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's a good chance Bob will counteroffer, giving you a chance to reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  $14,000 is still below the $15,000 value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer of $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm interested in selling to Bob, it's better to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need to be closer to my initial price.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to recover a fair price."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I'm really interested in it, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price. I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal with Bob."
