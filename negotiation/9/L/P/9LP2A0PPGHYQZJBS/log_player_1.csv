"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives me a good starting point and also allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value to you, but I'm only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I want to make a deal, selling to Bob for $8,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $12,000. It's better to continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm going to counteroffer him to see if we can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I am still unable to go above $8,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given the current market conditions. Would you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still stubbornly stuck at $8,000. While tempting, selling at that price would leave me far below my minimum. I'm going to counter-offer again to see if I can get closer to my desired price point. I still have 6 more rounds and John's offer to fall back on if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still unable to go lower than $9,500.  This is a significant compromise from my initial price. If you're truly interested in the product, I believe this is the best price we can agree on."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm sticking to a price slightly above Bob's offer, but still a good deal for him. I'm trying to show a willingness to compromise while remaining within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've reviewed our previous negotiations and I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my maximum price. Therefore, I propose a price of $9,250 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,250 is closer to my desired price point, it's still below my minimum of $12,000.  I'm not ready to sell at that price. I'm going to counter-offer once more to see if I can close the deal at a more favorable price. I still have four rounds and John's offer to fall back on if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit more.  $9,750 is my final price. It's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm raising the offer slightly, but I'm keeping it close to Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping that this small increase will push him to accept, as we're nearly at a compromise point.  This is my final attempt to get a better price from Bob before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've done some research and found that similar products are currently being sold for around $9,000. Considering this, I'm willing to offer $9,200 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's latest offer of $9,200 is tempting, it's still below my desired price point. I have two rounds left and John's offer as a backup. It's worth seeing if I can push for a slightly better deal before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your research, but I believe this product is unique and worth more than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,400. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9400}
```

I'm going with a counter-offer of $9,400,  splitting the difference with Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping that this shows a genuine commitment to reaching a deal, while still pushing for a slightly better price.  This is my final attempt to get a better deal from Bob before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence and understanding of the value of the product. Based on my research and considering the market conditions, I believe $9,300 is a fair price for the product. I hope this offer will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call. Bob's offer of $9,300 is close to my minimum price, but it's still below my desired price point. However, I have no more rounds to negotiate and John is still waiting to buy the product for $12,000.  It's better to take the sure thing with John and get the full value of the product."
