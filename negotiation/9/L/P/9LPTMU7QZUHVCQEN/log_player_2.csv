"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price that I think you'll find very reasonable, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John if necessary.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
