# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,600,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price.  Alice's offer is above your maximum, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $1,400,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've done some research and I believe the market value of this product is actually higher than what I initially offered. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,520,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,520,000

Alice's offer is still above your target price.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best way to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,520,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,460,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1460000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you at $1,480,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to go up to $1,470,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps me within my budget.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1470000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I've got to think about my own budget and the value I've put into this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,480,000, but I'm not budging any further. I'm starting to think about other interested parties, so I'd like to make a final offer. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,480,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation.  You have a few things to consider:

* **Alice is getting firm:** Alice is signaling that this is her final offer.  
* **John's offer:** John's offer is at your maximum budget, so you're not gaining anything by going to him.
* **Alice's offer is almost at your target:**  $1,480,000 is close to your target of $1,400,000, and it's definitely better than John's price.

It's risky to keep negotiating.  If you reject Alice, she might walk away and you'd be stuck with John's price.  Accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal and saves you the risk of a breakdown in negotiations."
