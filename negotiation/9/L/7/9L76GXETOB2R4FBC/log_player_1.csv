Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is a good starting point. It's a significant amount less than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation, but still significantly more than your minimum acceptable price.  This offer shows that you're serious about selling but also willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle for that amount. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1,000,000. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm willing to come down even further, but I'm still confident that the product is worth at least $950,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough call, but Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I would like to get closer to $900,000, it's a risk to keep negotiating with Bob. He might walk away, and I would be left with selling to John for only $800,000.  Accepting this offer ensures a solid profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal completely."
