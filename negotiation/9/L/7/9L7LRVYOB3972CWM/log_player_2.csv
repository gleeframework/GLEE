# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm proposing a new price of $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to consider this offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. I'm proposing a new price of $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer is still slightly above Bob's ideal price, but it's the closest she's come.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be unproductive.  Since the offer is within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price, it's the best option for Bob.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
