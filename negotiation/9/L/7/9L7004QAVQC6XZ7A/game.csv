"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to consider $850,000?  That would be a good starting point for us to work from.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me, though. How about we split the difference and go with $875,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875,000 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $880,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you at this point. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,5,
