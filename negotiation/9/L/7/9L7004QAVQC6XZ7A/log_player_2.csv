"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, there's room to save some money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?

While $900,000 is a good compromise, we're still not at the ideal price. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if we can get closer to $850,000."

Alice has come down significantly, and $880,000 is a good deal for you. It's only $30,000 more than your last counteroffer and still saves you $120,000 compared to buying from John.  It's time to close the deal!"
