"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is higher than the product's worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get closer to my minimum price of $100 within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. While it's tempting to take $80, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price to $95. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $90. I'm trying to find a middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

I'm lowering my price to $89. This is just one dollar away from Bob's offer, and I'm hoping this small concession will convince him to accept.  It's getting close to the end of the rounds, so I need to find a compromise."
