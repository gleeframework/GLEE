"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down a little further and offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,3,
