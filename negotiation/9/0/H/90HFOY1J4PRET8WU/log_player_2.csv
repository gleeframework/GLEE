"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your desired price range. While it's lower than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation to try and get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get closer to your target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my target price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired value."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I can offer the product to you for $1,125,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a fair price considering the value it brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is getting closer to my target price.  While I'd prefer a lower price, it's within my budget and the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price (or Alice refusing to negotiate further) makes accepting her offer the best option at this point."
