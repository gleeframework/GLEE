"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it's worth at least $120 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $125.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's message tries to persuade you of the product's value, her offer of $125 is above your maximum budget. You can definitely get a better deal by purchasing from John for $120."
