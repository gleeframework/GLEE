"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me.  However, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that 100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 92?",92.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $88. This would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at 90? It's still a bit above your initial offer, but I'm willing to give you a good deal.",90.0,Alice,5,
