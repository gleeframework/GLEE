"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, considering your interest in the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10500.0,Bob,4,
