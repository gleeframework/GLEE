Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 200} 
 
**Reasoning:**  Since my minimum selling price is $150, I'll start high to test Bob's willingness to pay. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still staying above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can't justify spending $200 on it. Would you consider lowering the price? I am willing to pay up to $150. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I can negotiate a higher price with him, and waiting carries the risk he'll lose interest. Accepting his offer ensures I get a fair price for the product."
