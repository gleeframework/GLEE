Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than your minimum of $100.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** You're leaving room for counteroffers and potential compromise. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $110.  Would you be willing to go that low? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer. You're aiming for a higher price. You can likely get closer to your initial price if you counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $120? It's still a good deal for you, and we can finalize this quickly."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  You're trying to move the negotiation closer to your desired price.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** You're showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're protecting your interests and ensuring you get a decent price."
