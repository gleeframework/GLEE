"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $1,000,000.  It's too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you need to make a fair profit. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,125,000? This would be a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,125,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to try to get a better offer from Bob, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
