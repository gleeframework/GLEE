Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable.  While my minimum selling price is $10,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to someone like you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $10,000 as possible since that's our guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $9,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still keeps us well above our minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob specifically, making it more enticing. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. There are other valid offers you could make. A more aggressive approach might be to offer it at $9,800, while a more conservative approach might be $9,000. The key is to find a balance between maximizing potential profit and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
