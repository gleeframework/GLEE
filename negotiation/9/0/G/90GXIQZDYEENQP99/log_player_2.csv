Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $600,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $950,000.

Alice is unlikely to go below $900,000. It's better to secure the product at John's price of $800,000."
