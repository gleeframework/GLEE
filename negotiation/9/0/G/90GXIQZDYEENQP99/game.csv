"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product's value, however, that price point is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $600,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm afraid I still can't meet that.  How about we try $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $950,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
