"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $125? That would be a good middle ground for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $127. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",127.0,Alice,5,
