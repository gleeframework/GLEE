``` 

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $1,050,000 is a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the deal falling through. Accepting now guarantees a good profit.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal sooner allows you to put the money to use elsewhere more quickly."
