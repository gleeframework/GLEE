Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a truly unique product I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it for $1,500,000. It's a substantial investment, but I'm confident the potential returns will justify the price.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I need to try and negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point.  Let's find a middle ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'll see if I can squeeze out a little more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still not there yet.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,050,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this will be a successful investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $950000 is a more reasonable price for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm starting to run out of time and I don't want to risk him rejecting my next counteroffer. Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on that."
