Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $900,000 is a significant improvement, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm confident I can do better, especially considering Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, as a sign of good faith.  This price is still well below what the product is worth to me, but it demonstrates my willingness to work with you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer of $925,000. However, I'm still a bit far from where I need to be to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $937,500 as a final compromise. This price reflects the value of the product to you, while also allowing me to achieve a fair return. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 937500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to reach a fair return, but $937,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but I need to stay within my budget. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $920,000 is a tempting offer, it's still not enough. I've already lowered my price significantly, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with continued negotiation. I'm also considering the risk of Bob walking away and potentially getting a better offer from someone else."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $920,000. I'm willing to come down to $930,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  This price reflects a fair value for both of us.  I think this is a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 930000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $930,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $915,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiation is reaching a stalemate. Bob's offer of $915,000 is still significantly lower than my desired price, and there's a high risk that we won't be able to reach an agreement. Considering the time constraint and the possibility of losing this deal altogether, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  This guarantees me my desired profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations."
