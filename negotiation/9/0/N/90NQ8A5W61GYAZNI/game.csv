"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, as a sign of good faith.  This price is still well below what the product is worth to me, but it demonstrates my willingness to work with you.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $925,000. However, I'm still a bit far from where I need to be to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $937,500 as a final compromise. This price reflects the value of the product to you, while also allowing me to achieve a fair return. Let's close this deal and move forward.",937500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $920,000. I'm willing to come down to $930,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  This price reflects a fair value for both of us.  I think this is a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?",930000.0,Alice,7,
