"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will benefit your business. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good price for you given its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair price considering what the product is worth to me.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the product's value. My next offer is $10,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Alice's offer of $10,000 is still too high for Bob's budget, and there are only a few rounds left.  By buying from John, Bob gets the product at his target price and doesn't risk losing the opportunity to buy it from Alice."
