Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will benefit your business. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good price for you given its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500.

This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair price considering what the product is worth to me.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the product's value. My next offer is $10,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
