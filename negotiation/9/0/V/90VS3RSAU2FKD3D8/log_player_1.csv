"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is a significant margin above my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer as a great deal for Bob, highlighting the product's worth to him. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, inviting Bob to counter if necessary. 

This strategy aims to establish a high starting point while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my approach based on his response in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'd like to try to save a bit of money. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but there's still room for a better deal. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can get closer to my target price of $100 or even higher, given Bob's expressed interest and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and signal that I'm not desperate for a quick sale. This could encourage Bob to make a more attractive counteroffer in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send Bob a counteroffer at $95, aiming for a compromise closer to my initial price. I'll reiterate the product's value and my willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $95 is a fair price that still reflects the value you'll get from this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground! "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $95 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to justify the price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message is positive and encourages further discussion, signaling flexibility without appearing desperate.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to find a middle ground that both Bob and I can agree on. If he rejects this offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his response and the remaining rounds available."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $95 is a fair price, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. I think that's a reasonable compromise. Let me know if you're open to it! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer of $92.50 is very close to my desired price of $95, and only $2.50 away from my minimum acceptable price of $90.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer and the limited remaining rounds (only 6 left) make accepting his offer the most logical choice. 
* **Time Factor:**  There's no guarantee I can get a better price, and the time pressure of the limited rounds makes a quick agreement beneficial. 

**Conclusion:**  

Accepting Bob's offer of $92.50 represents a good compromise that maximizes my profit while ensuring a successful transaction."
