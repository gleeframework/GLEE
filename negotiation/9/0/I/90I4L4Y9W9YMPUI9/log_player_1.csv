Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a good starting point,  I'm aiming for a higher price.  I want to see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $800,000 is a good offer, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  Let's split the difference.  I'll go down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1000000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'll propose $900000. Can we make a deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is offering a price that is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure I can get much more.  It's better to take the $900,000 than risk losing him completely and having to settle for the $1,000,000 from John."
