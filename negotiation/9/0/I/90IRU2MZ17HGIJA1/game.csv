"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both recognize in the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
