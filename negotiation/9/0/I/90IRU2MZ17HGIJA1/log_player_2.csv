"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $1,350,000. This is a special opportunity for you to acquire an asset worth $1,500,000 at a competitive price. Let's discuss how we can finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. It's better to reject and see if Alice will come down in price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for this product, as it aligns more closely with my budget. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we agree on a price of $1,300,000? This still allows us to value the product appropriately while being more accommodating to your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal target.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price. There's room for Alice to move further towards his counteroffer, and he still has several rounds to reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both recognize in the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```
