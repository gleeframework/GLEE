,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $130 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand $110 is a good deal for you, it's still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $120. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $115. Can you consider my revised offer?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, and I appreciate the effort.  $115 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $118.  This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",118.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $118. I'm willing to go up to $116, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",116.0,Bob,6,
