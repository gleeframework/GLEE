"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a great price for you, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're interested.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize a deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
