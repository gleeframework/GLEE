"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a product that's truly worth $1,000,000 to you, and I believe this price reflects its value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
