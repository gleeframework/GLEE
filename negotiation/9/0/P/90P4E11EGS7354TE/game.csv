"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,500. Let me know if that works for you.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $6,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $7,500? This is still a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I'm hoping for. Let me know if that works for you.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $7,500 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",7000.0,Bob,4,
