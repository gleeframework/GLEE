{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

*  Alice's offer is higher than my maximum budget of $15,000.
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with. 
* Buying from John is always an option, but I want to try and get a better deal first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. 
* This is a strong opening move, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate and setting a clear expectation of a lower price. 
* I'm aiming for a price within my budget, but also leaving room for negotiation."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price of $15,000.
* There are still rounds left, and I want to see if I can further negotiate and potentially get closer to my target price. 
* Buying from John is always an option, but I'm still hopeful I can secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing I'm willing to compromise.
*  $14,500 is still within my budget, and I'm hoping this counteroffer is appealing enough for Alice to consider. 
*  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's important to start getting closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is only $200 over my budget, which is a relatively small difference.
*  With only 5 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating and risk losing the deal altogether.
* While buying from John is still an option, it's likely I'll need to pay the full $15,000.  Accepting Alice's offer means I can secure the product with a small overage, which is still a good deal."
