"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,800,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to budge at all.  If he rejects, I can adjust my price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still a high price, but it's a significant drop from my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a step in the right direction and is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to reject it and continue to negotiate with him.  While John offers a safe $1,500,000, I believe I can get a better price from Bob if I continue."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,400,000.  I'm trying to find a price point where Bob will be willing to buy, but I'm not going to go any lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and I'm not convinced that he's willing to meet me in the middle.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than to risk a deal that may not happen."
