"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $9,000? This would still give you a great price and allows me to get closer to my target.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to propose $8,500 as a compromise, which is still within my budget and close to your original asking price.",8500.0,Bob,4,
