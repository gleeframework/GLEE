``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling for $10,000, while John wants $12,000.
* **It's within your budget:** You're willing to spend up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is below that. 
* **You're still getting a good deal:** The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so you're getting it for more than its value to her."
