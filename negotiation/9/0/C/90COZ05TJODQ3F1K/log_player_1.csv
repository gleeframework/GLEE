Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would greatly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal ($1,000 savings) while maximizing your profit. 

This strategy aims to secure a sale with Bob, as accepting the offer is in his best interest. Even if he attempts to negotiate, you have a buffer to potentially lower the price while still remaining above your minimum."
