Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to sell ourselves short. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation or helps us understand if Bob might be willing to pay even more than his perceived value.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value"", we subtly try to nudge Bob to think beyond a simple price comparison and consider the benefits of the product. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have a safety net in John, ensuring we won't go below our minimum price. This allows us to be bolder with our initial offer to Bob."
