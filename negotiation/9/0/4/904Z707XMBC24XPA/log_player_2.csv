"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is higher than both your maximum price and the product's worth to her. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to establish a starting point significantly lower than Alice's opening price. This leaves room for negotiation while still staying within a reasonable range of Alice's potential walk-away point ($12,000)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $12,500, which is the lowest I can go. It's a great price for a fantastic product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to her lowest acceptable price. While $12,500 isn't terrible, there's still a chance to negotiate a slightly better deal before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?"",
""product_price"": 11250
}
```

This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's latest offer and John's alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $12,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has reached her lowest price, which is the same as the product's worth to her. It's unlikely she'll go any lower. Accepting this offer gets you the best possible price without risking the deal by pushing further and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price."
