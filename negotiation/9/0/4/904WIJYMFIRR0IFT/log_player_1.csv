Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10,000. I know it's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth it to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This price is a starting point that is higher than my minimum but not unreasonable. It leaves room for negotiation while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum.
* **""Message"":** This includes a friendly greeting and emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Get a high starting price:**  This sets a baseline for negotiation.
* **Encourage Bob to counteroffer:** This gives me the opportunity to learn Bob's value perception and potentially negotiate a higher price.
* **Maintain a negotiation advantage:** By having a backup buyer (John) ready, I'm not pressured to accept low offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation."
