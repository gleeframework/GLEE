,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. That's a good middle ground, don't you think? Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $100 is still a bit above my budget. Can you try to meet me at $70? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $70 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to compromise further. How about $85? This is a fair price that's within both our budgets.  Let's see if we can make this work.",85.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $75, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",75.0,Bob,6,
