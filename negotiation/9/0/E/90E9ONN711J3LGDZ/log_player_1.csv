Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will meet or exceed that price.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price establishes a firm anchor point for the negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  While vague, mentioning the product's benefit to Bob provides a reason for the price without revealing your bottom line.

**Important Note:** If Bob counters, be prepared to negotiate. You have some wiggle room down to $10,000, but going lower means accepting less than your guaranteed offer from John."
