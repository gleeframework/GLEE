Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly beneficial to you.  Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. After considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a good profit, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price closer to his perceived value of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher.  Would you consider $1,275,000? This reflects a more accurate assessment of its potential benefits to your business."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

Here's why:

* **Concession but firm:** I'm making a smaller concession ($25,000) to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly.
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential ROI he'd be getting. 
* **Encouraging a response:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a question to encourage a response and keep the dialogue open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're seeking. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is now very close to his initial offer and getting closer to the halfway point between our starting points. It's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting at $1,250,000 secures a substantial profit."
