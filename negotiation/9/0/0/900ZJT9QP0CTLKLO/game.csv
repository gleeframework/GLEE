"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given the product's value to you, I'd like to propose a starting price of $950,000. This represents a significant discount, while still allowing you a substantial profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product, and its potential for your business, justifies a higher price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This would allow me to feel comfortable with the deal while still offering you a substantial discount.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value.  However, $1,125,000 is still quite a bit higher than where I'm comfortable. Let's compromise further. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000. This represents a fair middle ground that allows us both to achieve our goals. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
