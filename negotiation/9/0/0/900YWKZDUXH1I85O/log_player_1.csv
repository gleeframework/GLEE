Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $9,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $9,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly is preferable to waiting for John, even if the price difference isn't huge. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best price and ensuring a successful sale."
