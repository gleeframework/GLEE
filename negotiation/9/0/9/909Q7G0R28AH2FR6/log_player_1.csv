{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a little lower than I initially hoped, I've come down a significant amount from my initial price, and I'm worried that continuing the negotiation could risk Bob walking away entirely.  I'm happy to secure $930,000 for the product, as it's a substantial amount and is a good outcome for both of us."
