"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs and valued at $100 by you. Considering its high quality and the value it brings, I am extending this exclusive offer to you at the same price. Don't miss out on this opportunity to experience the benefits firsthand. If you're interested, please let me know so we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor you to the idea that the product is worth $100.  While it *might* be worth that to you, there's no reason to accept her first offer. There's a chance to get it for less from Alice, and if not, you can always buy from John at the same price."
