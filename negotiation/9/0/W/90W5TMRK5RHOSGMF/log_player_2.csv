"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further. He has a higher budget than Alice's minimum, and there's room for both parties to find a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This still represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still within Bob's budget. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob losing the deal to John outweighs the potential for a few more thousand dollars in savings."
