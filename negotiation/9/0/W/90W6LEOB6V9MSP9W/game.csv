"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $160 for the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $120, which is a fair price for us both.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $120, Bob. I've already compromised by offering it to you for $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $160 and $120, which is $140. That's the lowest I can go.",140.0,Alice,5,
