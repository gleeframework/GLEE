Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to secure a better deal. Since Bob values it at $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation. I'll be prepared to counter his offers if necessary, keeping in mind the guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is still a profitable sale, I'm hoping for a higher price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and aim for a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,050,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $950,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $980,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price and also surpasses the $1,000,000 offer from John. It's a good deal, so I'll accept it to secure the sale."
