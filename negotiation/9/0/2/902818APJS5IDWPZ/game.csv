"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product! I'm open to offers, but I'm looking for at least $150 for it. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can we meet in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $135 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $142.50? Let me know what you think.",142.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $130? I really like the product and I'm trying to make a deal here.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to make a deal, and I appreciate that. While $130 is closer to my ideal price, I can't go that low. How about $135? That's a good compromise, and it shows we're both willing to work together.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'll meet you halfway from my previous offer, which was $130. How about $132.50? That's a compromise I'm willing to make.",132.5,Bob,6,
