Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work for both of us. However, I need to be upfront â€“ I have another potential buyer interested at a higher price point. If we can agree on $1,080,000, I'm happy to close the deal with you today. This offer stands for the next 24 hours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is a good compromise, considering her stated urgency and the fact she has another buyer. While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and needing to buy from John at $1,000,000 outweighs the potential savings.  This offer is within my budget, and it's reasonable for both parties."
