Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $135. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit.  I'll be ready to counter if he rejects this offer, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price of $135. I'll counter with a price that's a bit lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

I'm offering a price of $130.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to make a reasonable profit.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get $130, it seems like he's firm on $125.  It's better to accept his offer and make a profit than risk a further stalemate and end up selling to John for $120."
