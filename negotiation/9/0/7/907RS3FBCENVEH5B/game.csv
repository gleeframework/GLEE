"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $12,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $18,000.  This is a fair offer, considering the product's worth.",18000.0,Alice,3,
