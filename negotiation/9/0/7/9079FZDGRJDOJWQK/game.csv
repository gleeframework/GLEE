,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,800 is a good price, but I'm still looking to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,200. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $7,200. Would you be willing to go down to $6,900? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet at that price.",6900.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm willing to meet you at $7,100. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",7100.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $6,800. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, though. I'll meet you at $7,050. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",7050.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more adjustment, but $7,050 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,050 and $6,800, which would be $6,925. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6925.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go up to $6,925. I'm willing to make one more small adjustment, though. I'll meet you at $7,025. This is as low as I can go without losing too much profit. What do you think?",7025.0,Alice,9,

"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to make a final offer of $6,900. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8,000.",6900.0,Bob,10,
