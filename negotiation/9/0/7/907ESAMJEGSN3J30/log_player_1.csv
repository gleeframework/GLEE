{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $1,200,000 is still below your minimum, so you have room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.
* **Is attractive to Bob:** It's lower than your minimum but still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him a potential good deal.
* **Shows your willingness to compromise:** This can encourage Bob to engage in further negotiation. 

Remember, your goal is to get as close to your minimum ($1,500,000) as possible, but you also need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is tempting, it's far below my minimum target of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for such a low price just yet. I need to see if I can push him closer to my target value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see a more realistic offer. Let's try $1,100,000. This allows you to stay within a reasonable budget and gives me a better starting point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  It's a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer.
* **Frame it as a win-win:**  It emphasizes that this offer benefits both of us â€“ it's within his budget and closer to my target.
* **Set a clear expectation:** By clearly stating a new price, it makes Bob understand that I'm not willing to go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly less than my minimum target of $1,500,000.  I'm not ready to give up on a better deal.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can push Bob a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it gives you a great deal. Let me know if you're willing to accept it."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show a willingness to compromise:**  I'm coming down from my previous offer, but still staying above Bob's latest offer.
* **Set a clear deadline:** By calling it my ""final offer,"" I am  putting pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
* **Emphasize the value:** I remind Bob that this deal is still beneficial to him, highlighting the potential value of the product. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move on to John and secure my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to reach your target price, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,020,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you can meet me at this price.

Bob's final offer of $1,020,000 is still far below my minimum target of $1,500,000.  I've already made several compromises, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's time to move on to John and secure the price I need."
