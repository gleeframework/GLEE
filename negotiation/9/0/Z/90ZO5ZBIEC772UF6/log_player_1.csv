Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I believe that $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer you $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident this product will bring you substantial returns. Would you consider $875,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Bob is offering the same amount as John.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will yield a better result. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
