"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that's sure to be mutually beneficial.  I believe a price of $1,000,000 would be fair, reflecting both the product's value and your potential profit.  Consider this a chance to secure a valuable asset at a price that's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
