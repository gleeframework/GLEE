"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,145.0
"I understand you think $130 is a fair price, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $142.50? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a good compromise.",142.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $142.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $135.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,140.0
"I understand you're willing to go up to $135, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle again. How about $139? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",139.0,Alice,5,,
