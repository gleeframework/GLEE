"I'm interested in the product, but $999000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925000. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
