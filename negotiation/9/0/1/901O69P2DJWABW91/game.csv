"I appreciate the continued negotiation, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the maximum price I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $687500. However, I want to make it clear that this is my final offer.

"I appreciate the final offer, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay $700000. I've made it clear that $687500 is my maximum price, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think that it's time to walk away and explore other options, including buying from John for $800000. I'd like to reiterate that this is my final offer, and I expect a response from you. If not, I'll be forced to move on.",687500.0,Bob,10,
