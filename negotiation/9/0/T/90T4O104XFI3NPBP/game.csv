"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a great product, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,000,000. Can you meet me at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $850,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I could consider letting it go for $925,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's worth while still offering you a great investment opportunity.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $875,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $875,000. I believe this is the best we can do, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price. Can you consider this my final offer?",875000.0,Bob,6,
