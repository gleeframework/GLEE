"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's price of $15,000, Bob can likely do better by counteroffering.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate, and Alice's initial offer suggests she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, $14,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to Alice's perceived value of $12,000 as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation. By offering $12,500, he's showing a willingness to compromise and signaling that he's serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is better than John's price of $15,000, Bob should still try to negotiate further. He's still within his budget and has several rounds left to get a better price. By rejecting the offer, he can continue to bargain and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $13,000?  I'm serious about buying the product, and I believe this price is fair."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying within his budget while inching closer to Alice's perceived value. He's showing continued interest in the product while pushing for a better deal. By offering $13,000, he's demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still leaving some room for Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,250. This is my final compromise, so I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is the best price she's offered so far, and it's well within Bob's budget.  Although Bob could try to negotiate further, Alice has stated this is her final compromise.  Given the time constraint (10 rounds) and the risk of Alice walking away, it's strategically sound for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price."
