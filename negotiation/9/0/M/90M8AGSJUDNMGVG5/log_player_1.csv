"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and slightly above what the product is worth to Bob ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  While vague, ""amazing product"" implies value,  which might entice Bob to consider a higher price. 
* **First Round:** I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by negotiating further.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $100 is tempting, I still have a chance to get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great value for the product, and it's closer to what I need to sell it for. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $110 to $105.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and reiterating the ""great value"" he's getting at this price. 
* **Firm but Fair:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm showing willingness to negotiate further.

**Next Steps:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground.  I'm prepared to adjust my price further if necessary, but I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget, I am comfortable paying up to $100 for the product. I hope this aligns with your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $100 is now at my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Equal Value:** Selling to John would give me the same amount, but I've already invested time and effort in negotiating with Bob.
* **Closing the Deal:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal without further negotiation and avoid the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers. 

**Conclusion:** I've achieved my goal of selling the product for at least $100, and it's a good outcome considering Bob's initial reluctance to pay my asking price."
