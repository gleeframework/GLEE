"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $130 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference at $135? I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,

I'm not sure I can go up to $135. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? I'm willing to pay that price for the product.,132.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that.  Let's meet halfway again. I'm willing to come down to $133.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great deal for you.",133.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $133.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $131.25? I'm willing to pay that price for the product.",131.25,Bob,6,
