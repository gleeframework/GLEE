"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm looking to pay a little less. How about $8,500? I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but $8,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still looking to stay closer to my initial offer of $8,500. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? This feels like a good compromise that's closer to what we both want.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,250 and $8,750, which is $9,000. I think this is a fair price, and it's the best I can do.",9000.0,Alice,5,
