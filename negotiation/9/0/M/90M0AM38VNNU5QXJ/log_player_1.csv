"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Starting high anchors the negotiation in our favor. Since the product is worth $500,000 more to Bob, there's room for him to negotiate down while still offering us a significant profit.
* **Confident but not aggressive:** The message emphasizes the product's value without being overly aggressive. We want to establish a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Open to discussion:**  Phrases like ""starting price"" and ""what are your thoughts"" signal our willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to maximize our potential profit while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is tempting, we still have room to negotiate and we're aiming for the best possible outcome. We started high, and his counter-offer is a natural progression in the bargaining process. It's too early to settle, especially since we have 8 rounds left and the security of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is below its true value. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,325,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your enthusiasm."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility but hold firm:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and willingness to negotiate by moving down from our initial price. However, the decrease is modest, emphasizing we're not desperate to sell cheaply. 
* **Justify the price:** We reiterate the product's value, reminding Bob why his initial offer might be undervaluing it.
* **Compromise, but aim high:** The new price of $1,325,000 is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still leaves room for him to counter while keeping us comfortably above John's guaranteed offer.

We're aiming to reach an agreement with Bob, but we're prepared to walk away if his offers don't reflect the product's true value to us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to our range, but $1,275,000 is still below our desired outcome.  We are demonstrating our willingness to negotiate, but not at the cost of undervaluing the product significantly. We have time and the security of John's offer, so we can afford to continue negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $1,300,000?  This acknowledges your position while recognizing the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:** We are moving closer to Bob's offer, signaling we are genuinely interested in closing the deal.
* **Set a firm boundary:** By offering $1,300,000, we are establishing a point below which we are unwilling to go, at least for now. This price still provides a good profit margin above John's offer.
* **Focus on a win-win:** We are framing the offer as beneficial to both parties, emphasizing fairness and a mutually agreeable outcome.

This counter-offer aims to bring the negotiation to a close soon while still aiming for a strong profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,295,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,295,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,295,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but his counter-offers are consistently hovering around the same price point. This indicates he's unlikely to move significantly higher.  Accepting his offer of $1,295,000 is a strategic decision for the following reasons:

* **Strong profit margin:**  While not our ideal price, it's still a significant profit over both our minimum ($1,000,000) and John's offer. 
* **Time value of money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate returns, rather than risking further negotiation rounds with diminishing returns.
* **Negotiation fatigue:** Prolonging the negotiation might lead to frustration or Bob potentially lowering his offer. 

Accepting now secures a favorable outcome while mitigating potential risks of continuing the negotiation."
