"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $25000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $25000. Would you consider reducing the price to $15000? I believe this might be closer to what we can agree upon.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $22000, which is the lowest I can go. Let me know if that's more in line with your budget.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, based on my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm not able to meet the price of $22000. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $18000?",18000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $20000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",20000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $19000 for the product. This is the highest I can go within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",19000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $19000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I can do $21000, which is my final offer. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",21000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed my budget once more and I'm comfortable proposing a price of $20000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us.",20000.0,Bob,8,
