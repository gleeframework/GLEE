"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high.  It's significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is far too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the product's quality and potential value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, even after her concession.  Bob is trying to save as much money as possible and $1,800,000 is still a significant amount above his target.  It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. This shows my genuine interest in the product while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's try to bridge this gap."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. However,  $1,400,000 still falls short of what I consider a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $1,600,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to try to get a better price.  If the next round doesn't yield a satisfactory result, then buying from John would be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now. To make this deal work, I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer and reflects my genuine desire to acquire this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
