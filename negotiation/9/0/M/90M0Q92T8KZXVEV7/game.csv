"Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is far too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the product's quality and potential value to you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. This shows my genuine interest in the product while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's try to bridge this gap.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. However,  $1,400,000 still falls short of what I consider a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now. To make this deal work, I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer and reflects my genuine desire to acquire this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
