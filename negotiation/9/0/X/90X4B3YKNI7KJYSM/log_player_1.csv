"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,750,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get at least $1,500,000 from John, so I'm not afraid to push for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could accept and make a quick sale,  I'm confident I can get a better price with further negotiations. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product for $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price but also willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not enough. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try and get closer to $1,500,000. While I could sell to John now, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,400,000.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and finally agree. If he doesn't, I'm still prepared to sell to John if I have to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only 4 rounds left, the negotiation is becoming increasingly time-consuming. Bob is clearly not willing to budge significantly, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's likely that further negotiation will just take up more time and may not result in a significantly better offer. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that guaranteed deal."
