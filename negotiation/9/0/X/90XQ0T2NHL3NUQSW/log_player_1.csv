Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This is to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value, but also recognizing Bob's maximum value is much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. While I can sell to John for $1,500,000, I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price significantly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum value.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still being a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still offering a price that is far below my minimum value.  I'm going to reject his offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise. I'm getting close to my breaking point with John, but I'm still holding out hope that I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $1,000,000. This is still above Bob's last offer, but I'm willing to go lower than my initial target to see if we can close the deal. If he rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've reached my limit with counteroffers and I don't want to risk further negotiations. John is offering a price that meets my minimum requirement, so I'm going to sell to him."
