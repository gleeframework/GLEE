"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it looks valuable, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for it. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you do $14,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",14500.0,Bob,4,
