Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $150. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Given that the product is not an urgent need for me, I would like to stick to my initial budget of $150. Could we possibly come to an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150.

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is firm on his valuation. Accepting his offer of $150 is better than risking a stalemate and ultimately selling to John for the same amount."
