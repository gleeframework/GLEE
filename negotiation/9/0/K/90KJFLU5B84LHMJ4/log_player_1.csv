Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my desired price of $1,000,000. I know it's more than the product is worth to Bob, but it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. This sets a clear baseline for negotiation and allows me to see if Bob is willing to come close to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I want to see if I can push for a higher price through counter-offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $975,000. This is a compromise,  showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to choose to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not confident I can push him any higher. John's offer guarantees me my minimum desired value, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob."
