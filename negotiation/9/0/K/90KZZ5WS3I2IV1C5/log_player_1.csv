"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum of $1,000,000. I have 8 more rounds to try and get closer to my desired price or I can sell to John.  I'm going to counter Bob and try to get him closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position,  $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and drop my price to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my final offer, can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but $950,000 is still below my minimum. I have 6 more rounds left, and I'm confident I can squeeze out a bit more. Selling to John right now would be a missed opportunity to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still not enough for me. However, I'm willing to make one last concession. I'm dropping my price to $1,000,000, my absolute minimum. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you. If you're serious about buying, this is your last chance."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're making a last concession, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. This is my final offer, please let me know if you can accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $980,000 is still below my minimum of $1,000,000. I only have 4 rounds left and there's a high chance that he will keep rejecting my offers.  Selling to John right now will guarantee me my desired price. It's better to secure the sale with John than risk losing everything by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
