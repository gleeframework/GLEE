Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000. Any price within this range benefits both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 might make him suspicious or unwilling to negotiate.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. I believe its true value far exceeds my asking price.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000, reflecting its significant worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a reflection of that value. 
* **Price:** $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a substantial profit for you. It's a strong starting point within the ZOPA. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower within the ZOPA to give yourself more bargaining room.
* **Relationship Building:** Even in a one-time transaction, a positive tone can go a long way."
