Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both Alice and Bob, there's room for negotiation.  Starting high allows Alice to potentially capture some of that value.
* **Justification:**  By emphasizing the ""immense value"" and Bob's potential return, Alice aims to anchor the price in Bob's mind.
* **Exclusivity:**  Positioning the offer as ""exclusive"" adds a layer of desirability and urgency.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just an opening offer.  Alice should be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters.
* Knowing Bob's personality and negotiation style would help tailor the message further. 
* While John provides a safety net, Alice's primary goal is to maximize profit, not just settle for $1,000,000."
