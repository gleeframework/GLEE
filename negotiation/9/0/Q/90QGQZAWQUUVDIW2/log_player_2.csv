"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. For this round, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a strong offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut bait. Alice is very unlikely to go below $800,000 and you have a guaranteed option with John at that price."
