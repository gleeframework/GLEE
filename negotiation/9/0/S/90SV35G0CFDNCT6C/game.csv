"I understand you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm going to take a slightly firmer stance and offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great value considering the product's worth.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $775000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'll meet you at $820000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",820000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go much lower than I already have, Bob. I think $785000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm going to try to meet you in the middle one last time. I'll offer it to you for $810000. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'm going to have to consider other options.",810000.0,Alice,9,
