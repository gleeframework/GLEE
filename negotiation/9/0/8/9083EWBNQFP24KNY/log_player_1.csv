Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start with a strong position. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The offer of $1,450,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, increasing your profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price and shift Bob's focus towards the perceived benefits rather than just the cost.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and how much you want to ensure a deal (even at a slightly lower profit), you might adjust the price closer to $1,000,000."
