"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception of value.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number, we ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. This can make him more receptive to lower offers later in the negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. His response will give us valuable information for our next move. 

**Important:** While we have a fallback option with John, our goal is to maximize our profit.  We'll carefully analyze Bob's responses to adjust our strategy throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,500,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than our desired outcome.  We have room to negotiate and will aim to bring Bob closer to our range. Selling to John at this point would be a significant loss compared to Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is generous, the value of this product to the right buyer is significantly higher.  I could consider parting with it for $1,700,000."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We are showing flexibility by coming down from our initial offer. 
* **Justification:** We are reinforcing the product's value without directly rejecting Bob's offer.
* **Targeting:** We are aiming for a price point closer to our desired range, but still leaving room for further negotiation. 

By gradually lowering our price and highlighting the product's value, we aim to find a middle ground with Bob while maximizing our potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still below our minimum acceptable price.  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate.  We'll continue to counter-offer strategically to maximize our profit. Selling to John at $1,200,000 would mean losing out on a potential $400,000 profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,650,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your strong interest."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We are reducing our offer in smaller increments, signaling that we are getting closer to our bottom line.
* **Compromise Language:** By suggesting we ""find a middle ground"" and ""settle,"" we are encouraging Bob to meet us closer to our price point. 
* **Value Emphasis:** We are continuing to reiterate the product's value to justify the price.

We are aiming to secure a deal with Bob above our minimum acceptable price while remaining open to slight adjustments if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,625,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is a strong deal for us at this stage:

* **Above Minimum:**  It's well above our $1,200,000 minimum and significantly higher than John's standing offer.
* **Positive Trajectory:** The negotiations have been moving in a positive direction, with Bob consistently increasing his offer. 
* **Time Value:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds.  Continuing to push for a marginally better deal risks losing Bob altogether.

While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the risk of Bob walking away outweighs the potential reward at this point.  Accepting the $1,625,000 offer secures a significant profit."
