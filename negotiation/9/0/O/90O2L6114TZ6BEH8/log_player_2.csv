"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. It's a unique offering that aligns perfectly with your needs and interests. Considering its exceptional value and the benefits it provides, we believe it's worth more than what it costs us to produce. However, for the sake of negotiation, let me propose a price that reflects its true worth yet allows us to maintain a fair margin. I kindly suggest considering an offer of $9,500 for this product. This price not only compensates us adequately but also offers you a significant saving compared to its market value. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of enhancing your experience with our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. You have a better alternative: buying the product from John for $8,000. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to pursue this more affordable option."
