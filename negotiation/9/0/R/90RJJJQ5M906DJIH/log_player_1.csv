Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product will be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant costs and opening up new opportunities. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. I think that's a fair price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While Bob values the product at $800,000,  there's no harm in starting with a higher offer closer to your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offered price of $1,300,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle somewhere between $800,000 and $1,300,000. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have the security of John purchasing it for your desired $1,500,000.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while considering Bob's valuation and your guaranteed fallback option."
