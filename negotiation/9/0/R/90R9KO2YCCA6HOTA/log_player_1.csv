"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is much lower. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget is a concern. How about we meet in the middle?  Would you consider $120 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $120 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm firm on my offer of $80.  If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
 
Bob is clearly unwilling to budge beyond his initial offer of $80.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to your minimum price.  Selling to John guarantees you get your desired value without wasting further time."
