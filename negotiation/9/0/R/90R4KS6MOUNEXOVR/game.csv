"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on this price.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you, given its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground there.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $975,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $975,000. That's closer to where I'd like to be, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is still a good price for you given its value to you, and it would allow me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can close the gap here.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
