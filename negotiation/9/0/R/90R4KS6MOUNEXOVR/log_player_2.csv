"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $975,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price.

While $975,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not at my limit. I want to see if I can push for a better price."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is $1,200,000.

While I'd prefer a lower price,  $925,000 is within my budget and it seems like Alice is firm on this price.  It's better to buy from Alice now rather than risk losing the deal and having to pay John $800,000."
