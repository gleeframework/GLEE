"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is far too high for me. Given my maximum budget, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $2,000,000 represents a significant discount already. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of this product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've already discounted.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
