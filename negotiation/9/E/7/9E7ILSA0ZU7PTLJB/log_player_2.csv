"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $100, which is more than Bob is willing to pay.
* **John's offer:** $120, which is the maximum Bob is willing to pay.

Since Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum, rejecting is the best option to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm only willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Previous round:** Alice's offer was $100, which is too high.
* **Counteroffer:**  Offering $90 is a reasonable starting point, still below Bob's maximum of $120, but potentially within Alice's acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  This gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $95, which is still higher than Bob's preferred price.
* **John's offer:** $120, which is the maximum Bob is willing to pay.

While Alice is getting closer, $95 is still more than Bob is comfortable with.  Rejecting gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 92} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Previous round:** Alice's offer was $95, but Bob is trying to get a better price.
* **Counteroffer:**  Offering $92 is a compromise, showing that Bob is willing to negotiate, but still staying below his maximum price."
