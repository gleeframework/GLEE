Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $7,500 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for the same price.  It's time to close this deal."
