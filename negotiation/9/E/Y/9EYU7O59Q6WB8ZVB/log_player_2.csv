"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price point, so it's in his best interest to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason: While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $8,500 is still above Bob's maximum price point of $8,000. It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
