{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above the $800,000 minimum I need. This gives me room to negotiate, while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to commit up to $850,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $850,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my target value of $900,000 in the next round of negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
``` 
 
I'm offering a counteroffer of $875,000. This is a halfway point between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am still unable to go above $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is firm on $850,000, and while I'd prefer more, I'm now at a crossroads.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely.  $850,000 is a decent profit, and selling to John for $800,000 would leave me with less.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most financially sound decision at this point."
