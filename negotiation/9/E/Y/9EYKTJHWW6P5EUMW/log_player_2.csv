# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the unique value of this product,  $12,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes a clear negotiation range and gives me room to potentially increase my offer later if necessary."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own something unique. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than my desired price point. I want to see if I can negotiate further and potentially secure a deal closer to my target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a significant step for me, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round to show I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still keeping it below my maximum budget. This offer shows that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my goal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not ready to sell it to you for $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.
