"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the unique value of this product,  $12000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $8000 for it.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own something unique. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9500. This is a significant step for me, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not ready to sell it to you for $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
