"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value and my financial constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal, the $1,200,000 price point doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both parties.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product.  Let's make this happen - how about $1,300,000 and we close the deal?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
