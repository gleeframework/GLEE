"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a decent profit. I'm being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great deal for both of us - it's a fair price for you and it gets me closer to my goal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90.  This is a fair price that's a win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I believe I can get a higher offer by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
