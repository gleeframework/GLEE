Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1100000 is certainly a good price, it's a bit too low for me to accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to $1200000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $1150000?  I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial.
