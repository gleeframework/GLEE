"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I understand it's worth significantly more to you than it is to me, so I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's still extremely advantageous for both of us.  My offer is $1200000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1100000 is certainly a good price, it's a bit too low for me to accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to $1200000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $1150000?  I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with the price of $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $1100000, so I'll counter with $1050000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
