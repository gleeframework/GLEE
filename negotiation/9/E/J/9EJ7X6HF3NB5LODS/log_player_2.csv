"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, it's still above my target of saving as much money as possible. It's better to see if Alice is willing to come down further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, considering your value of $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save as much as possible, but I'm still hoping to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $750,000 is a good compromise and gets me closer to my goal of saving money. It's also a significant step down from her initial offer of $800,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible, and I could end up paying more.  It's also important to consider the potential time cost of further negotiation."
