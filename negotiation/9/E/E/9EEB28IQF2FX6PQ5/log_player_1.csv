Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** Bob has given his final offer and it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price.  While you could try another counteroffer, there's a high chance Bob won't budge from his ""final offer"". Accepting a price below $850,000 puts you at a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer. It makes the most financial sense to move on to John."
