Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $90 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $75?"",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $85. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to negotiate further, getting the price down to $85 is a good deal and beats John's price.  It's better to accept now rather than risk Alice increasing the price or running out of rounds."
