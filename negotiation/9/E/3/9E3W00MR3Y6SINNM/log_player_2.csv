"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product to you. It's a game-changer in its field and offers unparalleled benefits. Considering its value and the impact it can have on your business, we're offering it to you for $2,000,000. Let's discuss how we can make this opportunity work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's not worth accepting her offer, as I can potentially save a significant amount by negotiating. It's too early to buy from John, as I might be able to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $2,000,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
