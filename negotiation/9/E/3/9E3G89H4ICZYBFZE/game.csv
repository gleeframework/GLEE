"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I can offer you the product for $8,000, which is the price I was originally willing to sell it to John for. This is my final offer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
