"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $12,000.  This gives me room to negotiate downwards while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $15,000 if this deal falls through, so I'm not under too much pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly, but I'm still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price point.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price point, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. However, with only 6 rounds left, the risk of losing a deal altogether is increasing. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit and avoids any potential risks of further negotiation."
