"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Goal:** Save as much money as possible while still getting the product.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $110 is too high for your target price of $120.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  You have 10 rounds, so you can afford to negotiate. Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** You aim for $120 max, so a starting counteroffer of $105 is a reasonable starting point.
* **Alice's Value:**  The product is worth $100 to Alice, so she has room to negotiate. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Starting with a lower price makes it clear you are serious about saving money.  Alice is likely to counter back, allowing for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $108 is within your budget and a reasonable compromise.
* **Negotiation Value:**  You've already made a counteroffer and Alice has countered back.  There's no guarantee of a better deal in future rounds.
* **Time Pressure:**  You only have 10 rounds, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal. 
* **Jhon's Price:**  $120 is still a viable option, but accepting Alice's offer saves you $12."
