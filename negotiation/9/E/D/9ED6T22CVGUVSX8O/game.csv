"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $16,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we try $12,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $12,000 is still a significant way off from what I had in mind. How about we settle at $14,000? That's a final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you say $14,000 is your final offer, but I have a final offer of my own to make. Considering your need to sell and my budget, I think $12,500 is a reasonable final price. If you don't agree, I will have to consider going with John.",12500.0,Bob,6,
