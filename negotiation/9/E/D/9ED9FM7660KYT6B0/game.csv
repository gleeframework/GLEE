"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? This is my best offer, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,500 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
