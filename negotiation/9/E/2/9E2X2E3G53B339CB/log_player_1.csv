Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point that is a good compromise between my minimum value of $10,000 and Bob's potential value of $15,000.  It leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is my best offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is better than my minimum of $10,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This takes into account your needs and my need to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
