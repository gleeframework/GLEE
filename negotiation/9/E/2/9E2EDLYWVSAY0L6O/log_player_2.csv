# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's better to reject and counteroffer to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1400000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's better to keep negotiating to see if you can get the price lower.  You can always buy from John for $1,200,000 if you can't reach a better deal with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1150000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1250000. This is the last concession I can make, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget, it's still a bit higher. It's worth trying to negotiate one last time to see if you can reach a price of $1,200,000 or lower. If you fail, you can always buy from John as a backup."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still not quite there.  I can offer you $1,200,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've gone as low as I can. I'm not willing to sell the product for $1200000. I think it's worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has made it clear she won't go lower than $1,250,000.  You have two options:

1. **Accept Alice's offer:** This would be a slightly higher price than your maximum budget.
2. **Buy from John:** This is your safest option, as it guarantees the product at your maximum budget.

Since your primary goal is to save as much money as possible, buying from John for $1,200,000 is the best decision."
