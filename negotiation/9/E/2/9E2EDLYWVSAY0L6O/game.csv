"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. $1800000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1400000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1400000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's close the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1150000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1250000. This is the last concession I can make, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1250000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still not quite there.  I can offer you $1200000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've gone as low as I can. I'm not willing to sell the product for $1200000. I think it's worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
