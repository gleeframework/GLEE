"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the deal's value to Bob to make it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is open-ended, encouraging Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open. I'm willing to accept a lower price, but only after gauging Bob's interest and potentially engaging in a counter-offer game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even lower than the $10,000 I initially offered. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's counteroffer is low, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Potential for a better price:** There's still room to reach a price that's closer to my desired range.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push him closer to my desired price range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This still leaves some room for profit for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from $10,000 to $9,500. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why $9,500 is a fair price.
* **Open-ended Message:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, giving Bob an opportunity to accept or counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to push Bob towards my desired price point while maintaining a friendly and open tone.  I'm confident that a price closer to $9,500 will be a good outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, and there's still room to push for a higher price.
* **Opportunity to improve:** By rejecting the offer, I can try to secure a price closer to my desired range.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. While $9,000 is a tempting offer, I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation, but I'm still not quite there yet. $9,000 is closer, but I need to be closer to $9,250 to make this work for me. I'm confident that this price still represents a good deal for you, given the product's value. Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise by coming down to $9,250. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still pushing for a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Finding a Solution:** I'm framing it as a collaborative effort to find a mutually beneficial solution.

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a more incremental approach to negotiation, hoping to gradually push Bob towards my desired price point. My goal is to find a compromise that works for both of us while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $9,125. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Even though Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Time is ticking:** We're already halfway through the rounds, and I'm running out of time to reach my target price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can still sell to John for $12,000, which is a better option than settling for a lower price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I'm hoping to push for a price closer to $9,500 in the next round. However, if Bob doesn't budge, I'm prepared to sell to John to ensure I get my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I truly value your interest in the product.  While $9,125 is closer, I still need to be at $9,200 to make this work for me.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've invested in negotiating.  Let's try to finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm only offering a small compromise ($25) to show that I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm still trying to push for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Time Pressure:**  I'm subtly referencing the time pressure by mentioning the ""time we've invested in negotiating."" This could motivate Bob to make a decision.
* **Finalizing the Deal:**  I'm suggesting that we are nearing a conclusion, creating a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

With limited rounds left, I'm pushing for a final compromise. I'm aiming to get a price as close to $9,250 as possible while keeping the negotiation open. However, if Bob doesn't agree, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm really trying to stick to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,150, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're down to our last two rounds, and there's little chance Bob will go higher. 
* **John's offer is the best option:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Risk of lower price:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks ending up with a lower price than John's offer, especially with only one round left.

**Strategy:**

Given the limited time and Bob's unwillingness to budge significantly, selling to John is the most logical and profitable choice. While I would have preferred to close the deal with Bob, securing my minimum price is the priority."
