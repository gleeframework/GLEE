"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This still leaves some room for profit for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation, but I'm still not quite there yet. $9,000 is closer, but I need to be closer to $9,250 to make this work for me. I'm confident that this price still represents a good deal for you, given the product's value. Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $9,125. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",9125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I truly value your interest in the product.  While $9,125 is closer, I still need to be at $9,200 to make this work for me.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've invested in negotiating.  Let's try to finalize this deal. What do you say?",9200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm really trying to stick to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,150, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",9150.0,Bob,8,
