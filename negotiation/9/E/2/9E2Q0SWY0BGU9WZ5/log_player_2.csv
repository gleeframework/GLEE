"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is within your budget, it's not the best deal.  You're aiming to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to take $85 for the product? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $85 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's a fair price for both of us, I think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $90 is still less than your maximum of $100.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While you could try to negotiate lower, Alice has already come down from her original asking price.  It's likely that further negotiation will only result in small concessions.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** There's a chance Alice might reject your counteroffer, leading to a longer negotiation or potentially losing the product altogether.

**It's best to accept Alice's offer at this point to secure the product within your budget and avoid any further risk.**"
