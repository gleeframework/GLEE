"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our top-of-the-line product to you, which I believe could significantly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Given its exceptional quality and capabilities, I estimate its true value to be well above $10000. However, to facilitate a smooth transaction and cater to your budget, I am offering it to you for an exclusive price of $15000. This opportunity comes with a comprehensive warranty and personalized support to ensure you get the most out of this investment. I look forward to discussing how this product can benefit you further. Please let me know if you have any questions or need more information. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. Since you can get the product for the same price from John, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but you don't have enough information to know if that's possible.  Rejecting the offer gives you the option to either negotiate with Alice or purchase from John, both of which are equally good options in this scenario."
