"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $10000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to sell it to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
