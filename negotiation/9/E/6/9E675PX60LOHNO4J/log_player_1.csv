{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also leaving the door open to a counteroffer.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider his counteroffer, but I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to sell for that amount. I'll make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 
This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm confident that this price is still attractive to Bob, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price."
