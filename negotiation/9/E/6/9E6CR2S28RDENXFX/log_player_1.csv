Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your original price, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from comfortable. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go any higher. Accepting the $12,000 offer secures a $2,000 profit, which is better than risking John changing his mind or potentially getting stuck in a stalemate with Bob."
