"I understand you're interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $13500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $11000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, but $11000 is still a bit short for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $12500. This is my final offer, so if you're interested, now is the time to make a decision.",12500.0,Alice,5,
