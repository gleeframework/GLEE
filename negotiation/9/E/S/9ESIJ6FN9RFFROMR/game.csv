"Hello Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree this product has potential,  $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $825,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $760,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value while acknowledging my budget constraints.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $760,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $810,000. This is a fair price that's closer to my initial offer, but still within your budget",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  How about $780,000?  That's a significant step from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about closing this deal.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. I'm still not quite there with $780,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $820,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price",820000.0,Alice,7,
