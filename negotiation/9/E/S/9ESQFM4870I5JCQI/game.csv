"I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,500,000 represents its true value, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we consider $1,200,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the product's worth.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price of $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
