"Hey Alice, I appreciate you offering me the product. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150, which is my absolute limit. Let's close this deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to your limit, Bob. I'm willing to give a slight concession. How about we meet at $155?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $152.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",152.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $153.50. It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to close the deal.",153.5,Alice,7,
