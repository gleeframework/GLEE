"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $600000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my desired price range. 
* I'm aiming for a lower price, so it's worth exploring a counteroffer. 
* I have 10 rounds, so I have time to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $550,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $525,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. Let's aim for a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 525000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $525000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm counteroffering at $537500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's latest offer is getting closer to my desired price range.
* We're now in round 5 out of 10, and I'm starting to run out of time. 
* Accepting this offer will save me a significant amount compared to buying from John. 
* While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, it's not worth risking the deal with Alice at this point."
