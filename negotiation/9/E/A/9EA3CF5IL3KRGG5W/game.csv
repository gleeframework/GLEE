"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $600000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $600000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $500000 for it, reflecting the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $550000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $550000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $525000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. Let's aim for a final agreement.",525000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $525000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm counteroffering at $537500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",537500.0,Alice,5,
