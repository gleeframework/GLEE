"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $12000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and still provides you with a great value for the product. Let's try to make this work! ",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $15500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13500. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if you're open to discussing further.",13500.0,Bob,4,
