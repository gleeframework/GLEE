"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and importance to you, I propose we start negotiations at $10,000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to suggest a different starting point.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 right now. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I would like to counter with an offer of $9,500 for the product. This still leaves some room for negotiation while ensuring a fair price for both parties. Please let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $9,500.  I'm willing to go to $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to lower my asking price to $9,250. This still allows for a reasonable profit while keeping the deal attractive to you. Let me know if this proposal works for you.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $9,100, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  This would allow us to reach an agreement and close the deal.  Let's see if we can make this work.",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I've considered your latest offer and am willing to agree on a price of $9,050 for the product. This price ensures a good balance between our interests and maintains a fair transaction for both parties. I hope this meets your expectations.",9050.0,Alice,7,
