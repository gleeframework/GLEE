"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me right now. I'm thinking closer to $5,000. What do you think?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers you [mention a key benefit Bob would find valuable] and more. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value this product offers, but $18,000 is still too steep for my budget. Could we possibly settle around $7,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can agree on a price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7,000 is too low.  Would you consider $15,000?  That's a firm offer, as I already have another buyer at that price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. While I know you have another buyer, $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can do $8,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,6,
