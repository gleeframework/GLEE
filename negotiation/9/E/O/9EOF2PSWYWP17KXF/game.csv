"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $12,800 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit lower than my target price. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll meet you at $12,200. This is as low as I can go and still make a profit. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $11,800.  Let me know what you think.",11800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11,800. I'll meet you at $12,100. This is my final compromise. What do you think?",12100.0,Alice,7,
