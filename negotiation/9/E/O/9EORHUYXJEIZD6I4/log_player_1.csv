Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit.  Starting at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation but keeps you well above Bob's perceived value and your guaranteed offer from John.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Highlighting:** Instead of focusing solely on the price, the message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" and potential for ""significant returns"" to justify the high asking price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you can't reveal John's offer to Bob.
* There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer, leading you to accept the slightly lower but guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. However, the potential for a higher profit from Bob makes this calculated risk worthwhile."
