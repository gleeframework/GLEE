"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential profit.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, I would like to respectfully suggest a price closer to my initial offer, which was based on the value I place on the product. I am willing to consider $9,000 as a compromise, which still allows for a reasonable profit margin for me while acknowledging your valuation of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
