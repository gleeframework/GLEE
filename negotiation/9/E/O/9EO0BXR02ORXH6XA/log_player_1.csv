Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the product's value, I'd like to propose a price of $850,000.  This would still allow you a healthy profit, and it's a starting point for a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my target.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Given the product's value to you, I'm confident we can find a price closer to $875,000 that would be fair for both of us.  Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to negotiate.  While $875,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to find a price point that reflects the true value of this product to you.  Let's meet in the middle at $885,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. While $885,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $880,000. It's a small difference, but it shows our commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $880,000 is only $5,000 less than my last counteroffer. While I'd prefer to push for a higher price, it's getting close to my minimum. Given the risk of further negotiation, and the potential of Bob walking away or my having to sell to John, it's a good idea to accept this offer and secure the deal."
