"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  Let's start with $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the product's value, I'd like to propose a price of $850,000.  This would still allow you a healthy profit, and it's a starting point for a deal that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. Given the product's value to you, I believe $900,000 is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit.  Let's work towards a deal at this price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Given the product's value to you, I'm confident we can find a price closer to $875,000 that would be fair for both of us.  Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to negotiate.  While $875,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to find a price point that reflects the true value of this product to you.  Let's meet in the middle at $885,000. This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  What are your thoughts?",885000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. While $885,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $880,000. It's a small difference, but it shows our commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",880000.0,Bob,6,
