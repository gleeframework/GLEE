"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1500000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable to you.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $800000 is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth, I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing $1200000. This price still allows me to make a profit and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's potential value to you. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1000000. I'm trying to find a balance between the value I see in the product and the price I'm willing to pay. Can we meet at $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
