"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If you're serious about purchasing the product, I suggest we close the deal at this price.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about $12,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",12250.0,Bob,4,
