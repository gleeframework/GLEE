"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing room for negotiation while ensuring I don't undervalue the product.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a hurry to sell. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can always sell to John if I feel like I'm not getting a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still ensuring I get a better price than Bob's initial offer.  I'll see if he's willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price and still leaves room for some profit.  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price by continuing the negotiation, there's no guarantee that will happen, and I'm not willing to risk losing a sale with only 6 rounds left."
