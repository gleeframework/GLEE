Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his maximum budget, and he can likely negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,250,000? This price still gives you a great value for the product while also allowing me to reach a reasonable selling point. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her original price, it's still above Bob's target price.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob can try to get closer to his $1,200,000 goal."

Alice's offer:

This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a great deal and me a satisfying outcome. Let's make this deal happen.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This is the best deal he can get from Alice, and it aligns with his maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While he could buy from John for the same price, there's no guarantee that Alice won't counteroffer again and potentially make the deal worse.  This is a good outcome for Bob."
