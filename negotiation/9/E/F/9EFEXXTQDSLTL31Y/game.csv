"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm sure it's also a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,250,000? This price still gives you a great value for the product while also allowing me to reach a reasonable selling point. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000. This is a fair price that's closer to our target, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a great deal and me a satisfying outcome. Let's make this deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
