Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm sure it's also a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

This price still gives you a great value for the product while also allowing me to reach a reasonable selling point. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Bob's offer:

This is a fair price that's closer to our target, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.
