Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** You have a strong BATNA because John is willing to buy the product for $800,000. This means you don't have to settle for anything less.
* **Bob's Position:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  This doesn't necessarily mean he's willing to pay that much, but it sets an upper limit.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John, your guaranteed buyer. This gives you a negotiating advantage.

**Strategy**

You should aim high initially. Since you have a guaranteed sale, there's no risk in starting with an offer above $800,000. This does a few things:

1. **Anchoring:**  It sets a high reference point in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely to be from a higher starting point.
2. **Value Signaling:** It could signal that the product is worth more than Bob initially thought.
3. **Testing the Waters:**  It helps you gauge Bob's eagerness and potential to pay a premium.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $950,000. I'm confident that after reviewing its features and potential return, you'll find this a worthwhile investment."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence can influence Bob's perception of the offer.
* **Value-Based Language:**  Focus on the ""unique value"" and ""potential return"" rather than just the price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $150,000 markup gives you space to negotiate while staying above your BATNA.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob is likely to counter-offer. Have a strategy in place for how low you're willing to go.
* **Don't Reveal Your BATNA:** Keep John as your silent leverage. 
* **Be Observant:** Pay attention to Bob's reactions and adjust your approach accordingly."
