"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **High initial offer:**  I want to start high to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Not too high:** It's important to avoid scaring Bob away entirely. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I want to give Bob space to counteroffer and come to a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I can see how much Bob is willing to pay. This will inform my subsequent offers and counteroffers, ultimately leading to the highest possible price.  I'll also be prepared to accept a lower price if needed, as long as it's above my minimum value of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is still below my desired price.** I'm aiming for more than $1,200,000. 
* **I have more rounds to negotiate.** It's too early to settle for this price, especially since Bob is already showing interest.
* **Selling to John is not optimal at this point.** I can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, leaving room for further negotiations.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I show that I'm serious about getting a fair price and encourage him to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a step down from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's last proposal. It shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong bargaining position.
* **Strategic mid-point:** By aiming for $1,400,000, I'm leaving room for further negotiation in both directions. This allows me to secure a good price while also keeping the door open to potential agreement with Bob.
* **Signalling intention:**  This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm committed to achieving a price that's closer to my initial assessment of the product's value.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to establish a negotiation zone between $1,200,000 and $1,400,000. This will allow me to gauge Bob's willingness to increase his offer, while also ensuring that I'm not giving away too much value. I'm confident that with careful negotiation, we can arrive at a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Good progress:** Bob's offer is significantly higher than his previous offer and is now within a reasonable range of my desired price.
* **Limited time:**  We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing a good deal by continuing to hold out for a higher price. 
* **Value for time:**  Accepting this offer is a good use of my time and resources, ensuring a substantial profit while minimizing the risk of further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

While I'm still aiming for a higher price, accepting this offer minimizes my risk of losing a buyer.  I can use this deal as a benchmark for future negotiations with other potential buyers."
