Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so we don't want to go below that. 

By starting high but still below Bob's perceived value, we increase the chances of maximizing profit."
