"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot more than that to me. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a better deal than $150, there's still room for negotiation. You know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's a good chance you can get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good deal for Bob.  At this price, Bob is saving $40 compared to buying from John. While there's always a chance Alice could come down further, the risk of her rejecting a counteroffer and Bob having to pay John's higher price is too high. Accepting the offer is the safest and most financially beneficial option."
