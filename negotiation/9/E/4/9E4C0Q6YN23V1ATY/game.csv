"I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, as I have another seller willing to sell it to me for $8,000.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $8,500 is your best offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm still confident that you'll find the product valuable and worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price, but if you're unwilling to accept it, I'll have to move forward with my other option.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $8,500, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll sell it to you for $9,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,
