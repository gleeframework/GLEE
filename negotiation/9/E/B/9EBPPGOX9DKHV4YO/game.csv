"Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. While $80 is still lower than I'd prefer, I'm willing to compromise. How about $100? That's a good price for both of us and would make this deal work.",100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm sticking to my budget of $80.  This is my final offer, as I know I can get a similar product elsewhere for that price. ",80.0,Bob,6,
