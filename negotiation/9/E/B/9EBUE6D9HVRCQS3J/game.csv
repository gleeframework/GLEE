,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $95. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my original offer of $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $85. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can offer you the product for $90. This is a good compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product.",90.0,Alice,5,
