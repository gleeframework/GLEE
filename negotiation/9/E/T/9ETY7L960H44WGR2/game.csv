"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $150. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $85 right now. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm willing to make a compromise to get this deal done.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $95 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $105? I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings.",105.0,Alice,5,
