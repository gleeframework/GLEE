"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll get from this product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $16,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $14,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $14,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you the product for $15,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
