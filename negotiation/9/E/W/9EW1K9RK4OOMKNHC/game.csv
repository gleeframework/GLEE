"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $105. It's a fair price, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $100. It's the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $102.50. It's a fair compromise, considering the value this product brings.
