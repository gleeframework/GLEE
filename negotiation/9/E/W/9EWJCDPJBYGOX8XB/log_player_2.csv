"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this price is fair considering the value you'll get from it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better deal. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away unless the price is more favorable.  You are willing to risk buying from John at a higher price, hoping Alice will lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
