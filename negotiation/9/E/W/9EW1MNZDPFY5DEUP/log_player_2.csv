"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a price of $120 for it. I understand its worth to you is $150, so this might be a fair compromise. Please let me know if you're interested or if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer of $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and significantly cheaper than buying from John for $150."
