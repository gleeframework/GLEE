"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This still leaves a good margin for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible but I can't go lower than $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and I'm confident it's a great deal for you. Let's close this deal.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,750 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  This is a fair price, and I believe it allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal.",8250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $8,250 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $8,500. This is a fair price that benefits us both.",8500.0,Alice,7,
