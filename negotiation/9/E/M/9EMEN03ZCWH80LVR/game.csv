"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1000000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $750000 at this point. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $900000 to facilitate this deal. This is a significant investment for you, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return. Let's find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $900000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $800000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
