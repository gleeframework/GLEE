"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1000000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price I'm willing to pay from John ($1,500,000). There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $750,000 at this point. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows my intent to negotiate aggressively and potentially get a good deal.
* **Fair but Realistic:** $750,000 is still a sizable offer, demonstrating my interest in the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for further discussion, signaling that I'm open to finding a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $900000 to facilitate this deal. This is a significant investment for you, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially since I have the option of buying from John for $1,500,000 if needed. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer than my previous one to see if we can get closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but not overpaying.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Alice's sense of compromise. 
* **Confidence in Finalization:** I'm expressing confidence in reaching a deal, further encouraging Alice to consider my offer."
