"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $100 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate. 
* **Friendly approach:** A friendly message makes Bob feel like you're interested in working with him, which can make him more receptive to the negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer allows you to see if Bob is willing to pay anything close to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$85 is still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Exploring John's offer:**  I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum with Bob, but if it looks like he's not willing to budge, selling to John for $120 is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a great deal for a product of this quality.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but not going below my minimum. 
* **Highlighting value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's quality and potential for a good deal can make him more willing to consider my offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $95 still gives me a little wiggle room in case Bob wants to counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $85. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to cover my desired profit margin.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** We are still in the early stages of negotiation, and I believe there is still room for Bob to increase his offer.
* **John's offer is a backup:**  If I can't get closer to my desired price with Bob, I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and finality:** This offer is a middle ground between the last two offers, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while also hinting at a potential final offer.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  By framing it as a fair price for both parties, it aims to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and make him more inclined to accept.
* **Closing the deal:**  With limited rounds remaining, this offer aims to push Bob closer to a deal, while also ensuring a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we meet in the middle at $91.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to cover my desired profit margin. 
* **Limited rounds:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation process, and I want to see if I can get a better price.
* **John's offer is a backup:**  If I can't get closer to my desired price with Bob, I can always sell to John for $120."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be fair. $91.50 is still a bit below what I need to cover my costs, but I'm willing to go down to $92. If you're serious about buying the product, let's make this happen.  "", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is essentially my final offer, as we are running out of rounds. 
* **Appeal to urgency:** Highlighting that this could be the last chance to buy the product might make Bob more motivated to accept.
* **Compromise:**  I'm still compromising, but I'm trying to minimize my loss. 
* **John's offer:**  If Bob rejects this, I will sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $91, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on my minimum:** Bob's offer of $91 is getting closer to my minimum of $120, but it's still not enough to cover my desired profit margin.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only two rounds remaining, the negotiation process is nearing its end, and I'm running out of time to get a better price.
* **John's offer is a sure thing:**  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me my minimum price, ensuring I won't lose money on the deal. 

Since Bob is unwilling to meet my desired price and I'm running out of time, it's more advantageous for me to sell to John and guarantee a profit."
