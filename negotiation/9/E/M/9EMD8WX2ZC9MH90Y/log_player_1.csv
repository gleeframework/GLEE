""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your operations. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price close to John's offer ($1,500,000) sets a high anchor. This makes Bob perceive any subsequent price reduction as a significant concession.
* **Slight Negotiation Room:** Offering it slightly below John's price leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price and make it more appealing.

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's potential profit while leaving open the possibility of securing a deal with Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed offer."
