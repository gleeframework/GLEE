"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $180 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but still within a range that Bob might consider. This gives us room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly approach:** I'm being friendly and positive to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Open to negotiation:** My message clearly indicates I'm open to discussion and willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's interest shows there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! While I appreciate your offer, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $150? That's still a great deal for a product like this."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm sticking to my minimum price of $150, but I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between our initial offers.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price point.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and conversational tone to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $110 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **John is a safer option:** While I'd like to maximize my profit, John offers a guaranteed $150, which is much closer to my desired price.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could potentially lead to even lower offers, pushing me further away from my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but unfortunately, $110 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $135. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** While I'm still above my minimum, I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price slightly.
* **Appeal to value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Final offer:** I'm positioning this as a final offer to encourage Bob to accept.
* **John as a backup:**  I'm aware that John offers a guaranteed $150, but I'm willing to take a small loss to close a deal with Bob if it's close enough to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to save a bit more. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **John is the safer option:** While $125 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Time is running out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob leading to a lower price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** John offers a guaranteed $150, which ensures I meet my minimum price and avoid any further risk."
