"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, knowing it's lower than Bob's perceived value ($120) but still significantly higher than my minimum ($80). 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, potentially encouraging him to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond, setting the stage for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:** While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $100.  
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting Bob's offer lets him know I'm not desperate and am willing to hold out for a higher price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting, I can send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a compromise closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $95.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate while still trying to maximize my profit. A $5 decrease shows flexibility, but $95 is still a good price for me.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I'm emphasizing the value for Bob (""great deal"") to encourage him to accept.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's see if we can make this happen!"" adds a slight sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $92 is very close to my target price of $100, and it's significantly better than selling to John for $80.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're already in round 4, and with only 6 rounds remaining, there's a risk of the negotiation dragging on and potentially ending with a lower price or a deal falling apart.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting the offer minimizes the risk of a lower price in later rounds and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
