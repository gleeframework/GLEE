"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $8,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'd like to offer $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
