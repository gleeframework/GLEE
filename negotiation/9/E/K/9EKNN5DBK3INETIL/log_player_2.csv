The offer from Alice is way above your budget. It makes more sense to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer reflects your maximum budget, and hopefully, Alice will see the value in a quick sale rather than going back and forth."

Alice's offer is still above my budget. I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price again."

I'm willing to go up a little bit, but $13,000 is still a good deal for both of us, considering I could go to John for $12,000. Let's see if she's willing to meet me halfway."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but it's still a bit too high.  At this point, it's better to cut my losses and buy from John. The extra $1,000 is worth avoiding further negotiation."
