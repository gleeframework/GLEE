Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This increases the chances of Bob countering with a price closer to his limit, potentially exceeding our guaranteed sale price.
* **Respectful Tone:**  The message is framed as a priority offer and a fair deal, fostering a positive negotiation environment."
