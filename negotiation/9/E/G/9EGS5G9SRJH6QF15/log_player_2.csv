"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$1,000,000 is a good price, but you can likely get it lower.**  You have a significant buffer ($500,000) before reaching your maximum.
* **Negotiation is worth the effort.** By rejecting and counter-offering, you have the opportunity to potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  A 25% reduction from Alice's initial price is a significant drop but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially reveal how much she's willing to sell for.
* **Setting the Tone:**  A strong initial counteroffer demonstrates your seriousness about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above your desired price.** While $900,000 is closer to your target, you still have room to negotiate. 
* **Further Negotiation is Likely.** Alice's counteroffer suggests she's willing to budge.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a better price.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** You still have plenty of rounds left. There's no urgency to accept a price that's not ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a midpoint between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will see if Alice is ready to budge closer to your target price. 
* **Maintain Pressure:**  By continuing to make counteroffers, you keep the negotiation moving and demonstrate your commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price."
