"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $95? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a savvy negotiator. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $110. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $100. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is as close to $110 as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
