"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $120 is still too high considering your maximum budget of $150. 
* **Next steps:**  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $95? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  This counteroffer starts with a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, signaling your serious intent to negotiate.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a savvy negotiator. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $110. Let me know if that's more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $100. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```
