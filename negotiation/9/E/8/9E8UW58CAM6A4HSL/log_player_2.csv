"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the value it can bring to your life. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You have no information about the true value of the product to Alice.  Since you can buy the same product from John for $1,200,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting gives you the option to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or explore other sellers."
