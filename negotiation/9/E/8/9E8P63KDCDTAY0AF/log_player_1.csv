"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to try to get a better price than Bob's offer.  I'll see if I can get closer to my ideal price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still confident this product holds more value than $1,000,000.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000.  It's a fair compromise, considering the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offers are getting lower, and while I could try to counter again, I'm concerned we won't be able to reach a price that works for me in the remaining rounds.  John's offer guarantees me a decent profit, and I don't want to risk losing out completely."
