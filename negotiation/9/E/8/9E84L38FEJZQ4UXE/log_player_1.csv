"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product. I'm also making it clear that I'm open to negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting with a high offer, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to lower the price if needed. 
* I'm also keeping the negotiation open by giving Bob the chance to counteroffer. 
* I'm aware of the backup option with John, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can only pay $9,500 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hoping for a better deal.
* I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob, considering his interest in the product.

**Strategy:**

*  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to test the waters further.
* This shows I'm not desperate and that I value the product.
* I can then observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $9,500 is still a bit below my ideal price. I'm willing to come down to $9,800 to show my good faith.  This would be a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price slightly, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. I'm also using a round number to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Message:** I'm still being positive and friendly, acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing my own value. I'm also reiterating the potential for a win-win situation.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer is a small step down, making it more likely Bob will accept.
* I'm keeping the door open for further negotiations if needed.
* I'm still keeping the John option in mind, but I believe I can get a better price from Bob by continuing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I've carefully considered it, and I believe I can agree to $9,600 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you and we can move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is $9,600, which is only $200 less than my counteroffer.  
* I've already lowered my price twice, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.
* While I would prefer to sell it for closer to my minimum value, this is a good price considering the circumstances.

**Strategy:**

* This is a good middle ground that allows me to secure a sale and avoid the risk of losing both Bob and John. 
* It's important to balance my desire for a higher price with the need to close the deal."
