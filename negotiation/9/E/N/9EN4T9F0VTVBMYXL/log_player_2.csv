"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price close to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $95 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($65) than Alice's initial price ($95). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Aiming for Savings:**  My goal is to save as much as possible.  Even though I'm willing to pay up to $100, aiming lower initially gives me a better chance to secure a lower final price. 
* **Considering Alternatives:**  I'm keeping in mind John's offer of $100.  If Alice isn't willing to come down significantly in price, I can always take John's offer as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $65 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you do $88? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $88 is still too close to John's offer. I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Compromise:** I'm proposing a price of $75, which is a compromise between my previous offer ($65) and Alice's counteroffer ($88). 
* **Direct and Clear:**  I'm using language that suggests this is a reasonable and fair deal for both of us.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer puts me in a stronger position. If Alice rejects it, I can still potentially negotiate up a little, but I'm getting closer to my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  Let's try $82.  I'm really trying to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and we're getting closer. However, $82 is still too high. I'm willing to push a little further to see if I can get a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $78? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also setting a firm limit.  
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm serious.  
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a chance Alice will reject this and the negotiation might stall, but I'm willing to risk it to potentially save a few more dollars. If she rejects it, I'll likely accept her previous offer of $82 in the next round unless she makes a significant move."
