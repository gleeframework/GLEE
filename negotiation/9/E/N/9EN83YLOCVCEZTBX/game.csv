"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the initial discount. However, I'm looking to get this product for closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? ",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,250. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to reach an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and agree on $11,125? This would be a good deal for both of us.",11125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,125. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $11,200 is a more reasonable compromise. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,5,
