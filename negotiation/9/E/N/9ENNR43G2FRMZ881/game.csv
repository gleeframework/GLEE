"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $775000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $795000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",795000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $815000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $815000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $795000 is a bit too low, so I'll meet you in the middle at $805000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",805000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're still not willing to meet me at $815000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $810000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to walking away from the deal. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to walk away from the deal, but I'm still interested in purchasing the product. I'm willing to meet you at $805000, which is the best I can do. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider other options.",805000.0,Bob,10,
