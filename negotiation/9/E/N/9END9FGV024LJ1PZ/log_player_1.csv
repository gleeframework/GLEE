Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is lower than my minimum, giving me room to potentially negotiate further.
* **Positive Message:** A friendly and encouraging message shows that I'm open to a deal and encourages Bob to respond.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my next offer based on his willingness to pay. 
* I'll keep in mind John's offer of $15,000 as a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations.
* **I have a safety net.** John's offer of $15,000 provides me with a fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't work out. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I can counteroffer with a price that's more appealing to me but still less than John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my minimum, aiming to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. If necessary, I'll continue negotiating until I reach a satisfactory price or choose to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer,  $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This price acknowledges the value of the product and still allows for a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:** $10,500 is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:** I highlight that this price benefits both of us.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I use a friendly and encouraging message to keep negotiations amicable.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a better price than his initial offer. 
* **Prepare for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to make another counteroffer or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still not comfortable with $10,500. Would you consider $10,000 as a fair price for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $10,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Risk of losing a sale:**  If I continue to reject offers, Bob might walk away, and I risk losing a sale entirely.
* **John's offer is still a safety net:**  I can still sell to John for $15,000 if I need to, providing a safety net in case the deal with Bob falls through.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale. While I would prefer a higher price, the risk of losing the deal and the time and effort involved in further negotiation make this a good option for me."
