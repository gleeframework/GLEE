,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer,  $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This price acknowledges the value of the product and still allows for a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still not comfortable with $10,500. Would you consider $10,000 as a fair price for the product?",10000.0,Bob,4,
