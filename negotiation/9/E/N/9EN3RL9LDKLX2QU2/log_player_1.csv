{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation of $1,000,000, giving him some room to negotiate. It's also below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, leaving room for me to raise the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. I'll give you $1,100,000 for the product. It's still a great deal for me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, so I'm going to reject it and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $1,150,000 is my absolute bottom line.  I believe this is still a good price for you, and it allows us both to make a profit. Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your bottom line, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm getting increasingly frustrated with the negotiation.  It's clear we're not going to come to an agreement, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
