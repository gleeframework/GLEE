"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from reaching my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Can you consider this price?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that recognizes the value you place on the product.  Let's make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but no more. I think this is the maximum I can stretch to, and I hope you can meet me halfway. Can you consider this price?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
