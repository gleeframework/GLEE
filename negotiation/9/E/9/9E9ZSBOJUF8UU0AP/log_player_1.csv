This offer is a starting point that aims for a mutually beneficial outcome. It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation without immediately shutting Bob down.  I'll adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to accept $900,000, it's a loss for me.  I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from reaching my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a loss for me. I will continue to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000.

Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but no more. I think this is the maximum I can stretch to, and I hope you can meet me halfway. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd love to continue negotiating with Bob, his offer of $1,075,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  It's clear that we're too far apart in our valuations.  To ensure I get the best possible price, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
