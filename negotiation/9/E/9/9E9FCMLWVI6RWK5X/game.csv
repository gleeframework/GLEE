"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you considering me first. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $14,000 is lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will bring you a lot of value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000.  If that's not acceptable, I'll need to explore other options.",14000.0,Bob,4,
