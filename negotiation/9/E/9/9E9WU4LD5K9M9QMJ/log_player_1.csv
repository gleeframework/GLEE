Round 2

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $11,000 makes sense for a few reasons:

* **Significant Profit:** We're still making a $1,000 profit over our minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out negotiations further risks Bob walking away.  A deal now is better than the uncertainty of no deal.
* **Bird in Hand:**  John's offer is a good safety net, but accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids potentially restarting the entire negotiation process."
