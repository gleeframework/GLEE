"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for the product. What's the best you can do?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective on the price.  While $8,000 is significantly below its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the benefits it provides and the return on investment you'll see.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand where you're coming from, but $10,000 is still quite a ways off from what I need to make this worthwhile. I can be flexible, but I need to get at least $14,000 for it.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $12,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,6,
