"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low for me. Would you consider $1,025,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product holds.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  While I appreciate the compromise, $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to accept a price of $985,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered. Let me know if this works for you.",985000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000.  It's the most I'm able to pay at this time. If you're not willing to accept this final offer, I'll have to explore other options. Let me know your decision.",950000.0,Bob,6,
