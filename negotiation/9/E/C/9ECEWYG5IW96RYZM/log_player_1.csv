"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a higher price.
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the value of the product to Bob by saying it's a ""great deal"" and that he'll ""find it very valuable."" This can help make him more motivated to buy.
* **Open communication:** I end with an open invitation for Bob to respond, encouraging negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I appreciate it, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. I'm aiming for a higher price and believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the discussion and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which I think is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm making a counteroffer at $95, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I frame $95 as a ""fair compromise,"" hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and encourage him to accept.
* **Urgency:**  I add a touch of urgency by saying ""Let's close this deal,"" subtly suggesting that I may not be open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $92.50.  This would be a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to target:** $92.5 is very close to my desired price range and significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Risk of losing deal:** There is a risk that Bob might not be willing to go higher, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower offer or even a rejected deal.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling to John for $80 would result in a lower profit.

By accepting Bob's offer, I am securing a good deal with minimal risk of losing the sale."
