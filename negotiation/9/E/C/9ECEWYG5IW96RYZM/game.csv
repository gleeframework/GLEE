"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I appreciate it, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which I think is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal. ",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $92.50.  This would be a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",92.5,Bob,4,
