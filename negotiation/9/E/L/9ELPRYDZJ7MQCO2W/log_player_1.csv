"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  I have 8 rounds left, and there's potential to get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, but I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500?  That gives us both a fair price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above $10000. How about we meet at $9800? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,800 is closer to my desired price, I still have 6 rounds left. I'm willing to risk another round to see if Bob will budge further.  Selling to John is still an option, but I want to exhaust my negotiation options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you're serious about $9,800.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but not that much.  How about $10,200?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $10200, so how about $10100? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,100 is only $100 less than my last counteroffer, and I only have 4 rounds left.  At this point, it's worth it to accept the offer and secure a deal. While I'd like to get closer to my desired $12,000, the risk of losing the deal altogether to Bob's stubbornness or needing to sell to John at a lower price is too high."
