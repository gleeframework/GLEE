"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's truly unique and I believe it holds significant value for the right buyer.  My initial price is $2000000.  I'm open to discussing this further, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds intriguing, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1500000 for it, which is still a substantial amount.  I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1500000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1750000, recognizing your budget constraints but also highlighting the unique value of this product.  Let's find a compromise that benefits us both.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1600000, which represents a significant compromise on my part.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $1650000. To make this work, I need to come in a bit lower.  I'm willing to offer $1625000. This is a fair compromise that demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal.  Let's find common ground.",1625000.0,Bob,6,
