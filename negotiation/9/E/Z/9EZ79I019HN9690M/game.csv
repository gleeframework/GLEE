"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $15,000. This is my maximum budget, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work. ",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $15,000 is below my initial asking price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
