{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer sets a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value Bob might find in the product, potentially encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to pay the full $110. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to accept his counteroffer. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value of $120. I'm confident that John will purchase the product at that price, ensuring I meet my minimum.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, as it may lead to a lower price or even a rejection."
