"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to pay the full $110. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
