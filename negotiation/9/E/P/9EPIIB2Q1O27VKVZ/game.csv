"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a rare and valuable product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. If you're interested, please let me know, otherwise, I'll consider other options.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for this product. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your research, Bob, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12000. If this is still not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to someone else.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $12000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $9500. Can you consider this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but $9500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $13000. If this is still not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,5,
