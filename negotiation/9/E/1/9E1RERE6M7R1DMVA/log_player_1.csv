Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:**  $100 is more than Bob's $80 valuation, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** $100 is less than your $120 minimum, giving you some wiggle room in case Bob counters.

This strategy aims to:

* **Get a quick sale:**  The price is attractive to Bob but still profitable for you.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  If Bob counters, you can either accept or make a counter-counteroffer. 
* **Have a backup plan:** If negotiations stall, you can still sell to John for your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is your minimum, Bob's counteroffer is right at the edge.  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum and likely less hassle. However, rejecting Bob's offer allows for a possible counter-counteroffer that could inch closer to your desired price.  By rejecting, you:

* **Maintain leverage:** You haven't committed to selling at Bob's price yet.
* **Open the door for negotiation:** A counter-counteroffer could potentially get Bob closer to your desired range. 
* **Keep the option to sell to John:** You can always sell to John if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next Steps:**

If you reject Bob's offer, you'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider a price slightly higher than $80, perhaps $90, to show you're willing to compromise but still want a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90. That's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

This counteroffer is a good move because:

* **It's a compromise:** It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than your previous offer, showing you're willing to negotiate. 
* **It's still profitable:** $90 is higher than your minimum of $120, so you're still making a profit. 
* **It's reasonable:** $90 is a halfway point between your last offer and Bob's offer, making it a reasonable compromise.

This strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** It demonstrates that you're open to finding a solution that works for both parties.
* **Maintain leverage:**  It doesn't give in to Bob's original offer, potentially leading to further negotiation.
* **Get closer to your desired price:**  $90 is closer to your desired price of $100, making a successful outcome more likely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I'm still a little over budget.  I'm willing to go up to $85.  That's my final offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is closer to your minimum, it's still a significant distance from your desired price.  You've already made two concessions, and Bob's final offer suggests he's unlikely to budge further.  

Selling to John guarantees your minimum and removes the uncertainty and risk associated with further negotiation with Bob. Here's why it's the best option:

* **Minimizes risk:**  You're guaranteed your minimum price of $120, ensuring you don't lose money.
* **Time-efficient:**  Selling to John avoids further rounds of negotiation, which could be time-consuming and unproductive. 
* **Clear outcome:**  You know exactly what you'll receive and can move on to other opportunities.

**Conclusion:**

In this situation, selling to John is the most sensible decision. It provides a secure and profitable outcome without the hassle and uncertainty of continued negotiation."
