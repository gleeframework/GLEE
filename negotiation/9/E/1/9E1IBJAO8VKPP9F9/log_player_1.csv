{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You have a significant advantage knowing the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 allows you to capture a large portion of the value difference ($400,000) while still leaving Bob with a potential gain ($100,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, bringing you still well above your minimum.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 with John, so there's less pressure to settle for a low price from Bob."
