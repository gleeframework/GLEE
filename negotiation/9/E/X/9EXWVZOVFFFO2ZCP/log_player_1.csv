Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500.  I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Positive Framing:** My message highlights the product's value and invites Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I make a profit of $9,500, which is better than my guaranteed $10,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** I can then sell to John for the guaranteed $10,000. I haven't lost anything by aiming a little higher with Bob initially."
