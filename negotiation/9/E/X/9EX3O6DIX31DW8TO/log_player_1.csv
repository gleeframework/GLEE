Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit you."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, I know I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000.  It makes sense to start with a high offer to see if Bob will bite. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $20,000 offer leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can work towards a mutually agreeable price that's still significantly higher than my fallback option.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to influence Bob's perception and justify the high price.

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, there's room to negotiate downwards. It's unlikely he'll accept $20,000 outright, but it sets the stage for potentially securing a price closer to $15,000 or even higher."
