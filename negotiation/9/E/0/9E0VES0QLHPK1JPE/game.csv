"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, which is still a fair value given its potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This offer reflects the true value and potential of this product. Let me know your thoughts.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,850,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's aim for a number we can both agree on. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  $1,200,000 is significantly below its true potential. To close this deal, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,600,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair. ",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your desire to get the best price, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget.  To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping you'll see it as a fair offer.  Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
