"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, $950,000 is a significant gap from what I'm looking to achieve. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,050,000?  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a considerable advantage.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,025,000 is getting closer, but I need to be closer to realizing the full value of this product.  Let's settle this right now - I'm willing to come down to $1,037,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair and allows both of us to walk away with a win.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
