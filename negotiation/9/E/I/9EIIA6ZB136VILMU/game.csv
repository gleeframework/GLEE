I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $800000.,800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me at $750000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $750000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm going to counter with $820000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $820000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $780000, so I'm offering $790000. Can you consider this price?",790000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still a bit concerned that $790000 might not be enough to justify the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $820000, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $810000. It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with $810000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $795000, so I'm offering $805000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",805000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $810000, but I need to get a bit more. Let's try $815000. It's a small increment, but I think it's worth considering.",815000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with $815000. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $805000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price. Can you consider it?",805000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting serious about walking away, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $805000, but I need to make one final push to get closer to my target. I'm willing to compromise on the price, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. Let's try $812500. It's a small increment, but I think it's worth considering.",812500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $805000. I've made a fair offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm going to stop negotiating and consider buying the product from John for $1000000 if you're not willing to meet me at $805000.",805000.0,Bob,10,
