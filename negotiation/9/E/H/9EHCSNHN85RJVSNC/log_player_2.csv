"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still $1,000 more than Alice's value for the product. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $13,500?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
