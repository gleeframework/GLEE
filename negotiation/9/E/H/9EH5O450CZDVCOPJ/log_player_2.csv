"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's a good starting point, you have room to negotiate and potentially save money. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and explore a price that's more favorable to you."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,090,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm feeling very close to a deal, and I'm willing to go up to $1,070,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $1,080,000 is still above your preferred price point. It's worth attempting to negotiate further, particularly since you have a few rounds left and have already demonstrated a willingness to reach a compromise. You're close to a deal, and there's a good chance Alice will be willing to budge a bit more to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to go a little higher.  How about $1,075,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, but I need to think about the next step. Let me check with some other potential buyers to see if there's a better offer on the table. I'll get back to you shortly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stalling and implying she's going to explore other options. This is a sign she's not going to budge further. It's likely that continuing to negotiate won't lead to a better price. With only one round remaining, it's wiser to secure the product from John for $1,200,000, which is still within your budget.  It's important to avoid getting stuck in a negotiation that may lead to a missed opportunity."
