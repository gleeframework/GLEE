Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to be flexible, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm confident this product will bring significant benefits to your business, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,050,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I value your willingness to negotiate,  $950,000 unfortunately doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm prepared to offer a final compromise at $1,000,000.
