"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's priced competitively. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the unique nature of the product to try and pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, implying I'm open to negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is a very aggressive starting point.  I'm  aware that it may be risky to start so high, but I'm hoping to maximize my earnings.  I'm prepared to adjust my strategy if Bob's response suggests a different approach is necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the competitive pricing. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1800000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:** While it's lower than my initial offer, it's still above my $1,500,000 floor.  This suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my initial price:**  I'm not yet ready to settle for $1,800,000.  I believe I can potentially push for a higher price, especially since I have multiple rounds left.

**Next Round:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm happy to come down to $1,900,000, which reflects the value of this unique product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm making a counteroffer that's halfway between my initial price and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a favorable price.
* **Emphasizing value again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique qualities to justify my price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, hoping to encourage further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round. If he rejects this offer, I might be willing to come down further, but I'll still try to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $1850000 for your product. This is my best offer within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum, but close:**  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than I'd like, but it's still above my $1,500,000 floor. 
* **Potential for a higher price:**  We're getting close to a deal, but I believe I can still squeeze a bit more out of Bob. He's shown willingness to negotiate.
* **Rounds remaining:** With 6 rounds left, I have some time to explore further negotiation before needing to consider selling to John.

**Next Round:**

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, aiming to meet Bob's budget while still staying above my minimum. I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product and the benefit of reaching a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I understand your budget, $1,850,000 still doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,875,000? This allows us both to secure a fair deal, and it's a good starting point for a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price exactly halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous offer. This shows a commitment to compromise and might encourage Bob to feel closer to a deal. 
* **Focus on fairness:** I'm emphasizing the idea of a ""fair deal"" for both of us, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Setting the stage for a final agreement:** I'm framing this offer as a starting point for a final agreement, suggesting a willingness to finalize the transaction if Bob accepts.

**Next Steps:**

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be appealing enough to Bob to accept. If he rejects, I will need to reassess my strategy and be prepared to consider selling to John if necessary.  I will need to weigh the potential of securing a slightly higher price from Bob against the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet halfway. My final offer for your product is $1860000. I hope this aligns better with our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $10,000 below my previous counteroffer and just $60,000 below my initial price. This is a significant gain, considering my minimum was $1,500,000.
* **Final offer:** Bob has declared this his final offer, meaning further negotiation might be futile.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer and make a counteroffer, there's a high chance Bob will walk away, leaving me with the option to sell to John for a significantly lower price.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the best option in this situation. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the circumstances and the risk of losing the sale entirely."
