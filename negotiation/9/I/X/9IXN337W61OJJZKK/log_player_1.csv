Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $8,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth at least $8,000 to you, you're subtly anchoring Bob's perception of its value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $12,000 gives Bob the opportunity to counter-offer. You can then negotiate down towards your minimum if needed.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Since you have John as a backup buyer at $8,000, there's less risk in starting with a higher asking price to Bob."
