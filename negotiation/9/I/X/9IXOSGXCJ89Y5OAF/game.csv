"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer is $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's start with $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,350,000. This is my best offer for now.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit too far apart.  Let's try $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about this deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
