"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested.  $90 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to work with you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $100?  That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle at $105?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really pushing the limit of my budget at $100. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to go with another option.",100.0,Bob,6,
