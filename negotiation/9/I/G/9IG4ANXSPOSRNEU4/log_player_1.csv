Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price of $130, which is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I am not going for the full $150 immediately, as this might lead to Bob immediately rejecting the offer.  I want to see if Bob will counter.
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm aware of John's offer of $150, so I'm not overly worried about losing the deal entirely. This gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and it's also below the value of the product to me ($150).
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is too low, it demonstrates he is willing to negotiate.  There's a chance I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm still aware of John's offer, which ensures I can always secure a good price if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested.  $90 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to work with you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm highlighting the ""good deal"" aspect for Bob, reminding him that $110 is still significantly less than what he would be paying elsewhere.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not going all the way to $130, leaving some room for Bob to counter again if he wants."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $100?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation Continued:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to negotiate.  There's a strong chance I can get a price closer to my target.
* **John's Offer:** I'm still confident that John will buy the product for $150 if these negotiations fall through.  This gives me the luxury to continue bargaining with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle at $105?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  I'm making a final push to see if I can get Bob to budge.  $105 is a good compromise, and it's only $5 away from his offer.
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect to make the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Closing the Deal:** I want to see if this offer will be enough to get Bob to accept. If not, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really pushing the limit of my budget at $100. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to go with another option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Deadlock:** Bob's final offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** I know that John is willing to buy the product for $150, which is significantly better than the $100 that Bob is offering.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing John's offer or taking up valuable time.  Selling to John is the most financially advantageous decision at this point."
