Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already told you, Bob, I'm not willing to go below $90. I'm not budging from that price. If you want the product, you'll have to meet me at $90.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $90.  It's unlikely she'll change her mind at this point, and we have a guaranteed offer from John for $80.  It's time to cut our losses and take the sure thing."
