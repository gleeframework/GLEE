"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. ",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's settle at $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
