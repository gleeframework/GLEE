Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's trying to get a bargain. John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and avoids further negotiation. It's time to move on."
