"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,100,000. This is a strong opening position, leaving room for negotiation and ensuring I don't leave too much value on the table for Bob.
* **Leaving Space for Negotiation:** While I'm confident in the product's value, I'm not asking for the full $1,200,000 Bob is willing to pay. This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling pressured.
* **Strategic First Move:** This opening offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my desired price. While it's above my minimum, it's still not a good enough deal for me at this point in the negotiation. 
* **Continuing the Negotiation:** I believe I can still secure a better price. There's potential to close the gap and find a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** Selling to John for $800,000 would be a last resort. I want to explore all options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a significant profit margin.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's a reasonable compromise that shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Maintaining Control:** This price is still above my minimum, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer. It allows me to control the negotiation and see if Bob is willing to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  However, given the limited number of rounds remaining, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. 
* **Selling to John:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.  
* **Minimizing Risk:**  There's a chance Bob won't counter-offer further, and I risk ending the negotiation without a deal.  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed outcome and eliminates the risk of getting a worse deal."
