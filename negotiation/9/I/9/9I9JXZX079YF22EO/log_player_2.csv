"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Your maximum value:** You're willing to pay up to $150.
* **Alice's offer:** She's selling for $135.
* **Alternative option:** Buying from John costs $150.

Since Alice's offer is lower than your maximum value and lower than John's price, it's a better deal for you. Accepting her offer saves you $15 compared to buying from John."
