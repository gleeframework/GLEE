"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate the offer, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1200000, which is a significant discount from the initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still beyond my price point. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $900000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This will allow us to finalize the deal and avoid further back-and-forth negotiations.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate Bob's willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not convinced that $900000 is enough to cover the product's value. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I can offer you a price of $1100000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm still not comfortable with $1100000.  I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a significant move for me, and I truly believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's reach a deal in this round.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate Bob's flexibility, but I'm still not willing to go below $1200000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're almost there! While I appreciate your coming down in price, $1050000 is still outside of my comfortable range.  I'm willing to offer a final price of $975000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that both of us can be happy with. Let's make a deal in this round.",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to make one more significant concession to try to reach a deal. I can offer you a price of $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1025000.0,Alice,9,
