"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $120, which is a good deal.
* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  You are willing to spend up to $150, and Alice's offer is below that. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer is not beneficial:** If you reject, you'll end up paying more with John."
