Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still a bit off from my target. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I need to be sure I'm getting the best deal possible. Can you meet me at this price or is this the final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

While a higher price is ideal, Bob is clearly anchoring at $1,325,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
