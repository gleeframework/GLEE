I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it's still a good margin for me.  It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is more than Bob values the product at, it's still far below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,200,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves me a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge much, and while $950,000 is better than his initial offer, it's still significantly lower than what I need. To avoid further negotiation and ensure a solid profit, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
