"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $11500.  What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $12250? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this transaction.",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000, which is my maximum. Let's close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
