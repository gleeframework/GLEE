"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is asking for more. It makes sense to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $12250? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, it's still above his maximum. There are still rounds remaining, and he can try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is my maximum. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
