{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're willing to pay up to $800,000, and her offer is $200,000 more than that. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but this is my final offer. It's still a significant discount from my initial price, and it allows you to acquire a valuable product for a competitive price.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $950,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate, as you could potentially secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's close this deal and make it happen. This is my final offer.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $925,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. While it's a better price than her initial offer, it's not worth continuing to negotiate. You're better off buying the product from John for $800,000, as this guarantees you the product at a price you're comfortable with."
