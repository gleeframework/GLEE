"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $110. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $130 is still a bit high for me.  How about $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy right now.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $128. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",128.0,Alice,5,
