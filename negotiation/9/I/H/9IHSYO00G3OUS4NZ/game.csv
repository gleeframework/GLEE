"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit too high for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find hard to resist.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,
