Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit too high for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find hard to resist.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $10,000.  Cutting losses and buying from John guarantees the best price."
