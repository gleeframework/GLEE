"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm offering you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $725,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $800,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product.  I hope you'll accept it.",800000.0,Alice,5,
