"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price and still have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob.  It's worth seeing if we can close the gap a bit more before selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think a more reasonable price would be $1,075,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While Bob's offer is getting closer, I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate. It's worth seeing if we can get a price closer to $1,100,000 before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000.  Let's try $1,090,000. This is a fair compromise that's closer to what I need and still a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1090000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,090,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,060,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can agree on this price

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to get a little nervous,  I'm still not going to sell to John yet. Bob is getting closer to my asking price, and I have four rounds left. I'm going to make one more counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,060,000 is still too low for me. Let's compromise at $1,080,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $1,070,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are down to the last two rounds and Bob is only willing to go up to $1,070,000.  I'm not comfortable selling for that price, and I'm afraid that he won't budge any further.  To secure a better price, I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000."
