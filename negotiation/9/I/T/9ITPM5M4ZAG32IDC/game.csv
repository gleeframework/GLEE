"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $9,000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a great price for you considering the product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could you do $9,500? I think that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. $9,500 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to go down to $10,000 as a final offer.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
