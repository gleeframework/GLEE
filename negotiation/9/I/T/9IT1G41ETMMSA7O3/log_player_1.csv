Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000. This gives me some room for negotiation and hopefully allows me to get closer to my minimum value of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $9,500.  This is a compromise that is halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. It hopefully incentivizes Bob to accept while still being above my minimum acceptable price."
