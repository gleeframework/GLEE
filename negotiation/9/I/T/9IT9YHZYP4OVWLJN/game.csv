"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're eager to sell, but $1,050,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably spend.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away satisfied. I'm confident this is a price we can agree on.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I can offer the product to you for $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise.",975000.0,Alice,5,
