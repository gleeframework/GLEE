# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product for $1,200,000. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love, and I'm willing to make a strong opening offer to get us started.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a price closer to his limit.  He can likely get a better deal by making another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I can offer the product to you for $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. While they are getting closer, the negotiation is becoming time-consuming.  It's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John at a guaranteed price of $800,000.  This saves Bob time and ensures he gets the product within his budget."
