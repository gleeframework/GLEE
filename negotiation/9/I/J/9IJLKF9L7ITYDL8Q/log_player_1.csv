Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. While it's higher than what I'll ultimately accept, it creates room for negotiation.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" and ""Unique Value"":** This language subtly emphasizes the product's desirability and scarcity, potentially increasing Bob's perceived value. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer.  My minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000 (since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price), so there's a buffer for negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a sense that he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal."
