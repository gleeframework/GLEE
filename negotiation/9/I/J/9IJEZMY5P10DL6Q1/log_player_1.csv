Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $95 for it."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than $80, which is your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $95 is still less than the $100 Bob values the product at, giving him an incentive to buy. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for potential counteroffers and a chance for you to increase the price further. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while keeping Bob interested in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Here's why:

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  While you could accept $85, it's lower than your $80 minimum. You're better off trying to get closer to your desired price.
* **You have a safety net:** You can always sell to John for $80, so you have room to negotiate with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Send a counteroffer:** This gives you a chance to increase the price and potentially get closer to $95.
* **See if Bob is willing to pay more:**  He may be willing to budge slightly to secure the deal.

The next round is a good opportunity to see if you can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I can't go that low. How about $90? It's still a good value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

Here's why this counteroffer works:

* **It's a compromise:**  It's not your original asking price, but it's higher than Bob's offer, showing you're willing to meet him halfway.
* **It's still within Bob's budget:**  $90 is still below the $100 Bob values the product at, so it's a reasonable compromise.
* **It keeps the negotiation moving:**  By offering a counteroffer, you demonstrate your willingness to negotiate and keep the conversation going.

This strategy aims to secure a price closer to your desired amount while maintaining a positive and productive conversation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've thought about it and I'm willing to pay $87 for the product. Is that within your range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best choice:

* **It's above your minimum:** Bob's offer of $87 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **It's close to your counteroffer:** You had previously offered $90, so accepting $87 is a slight compromise. 
* **It avoids further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob entirely, especially since you have a safety net with John's offer of $80.

While you might prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and secures a decent profit. There's a good chance that further negotiation might lead to a lower price, and you're already above your minimum. It's a good time to lock in the deal and move on."
