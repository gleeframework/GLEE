Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $25,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 25000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but not an unreasonable one. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'm willing to pay $20000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $20,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest, but I'm looking for a price closer to $22,000. It's still a good deal, and I'm confident this product will be valuable to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}
```

I'm  countering Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range. I'm still emphasizing the value of the product and trying to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $21000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $21,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $21,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $21,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $22,000. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation and showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still looking for $22,000. I'm confident the product will be worth it for you.  Let's try to reach a compromise, I'm open to discussing other options."", ""product_price"": 22000}
```

I'm sticking to my price and emphasizing the value of the product. I'm also suggesting to Bob that I'm open to finding other solutions if he's still not comfortable with the price. This keeps the door open for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're still looking for $22000, but I'm not willing to go that high. I'm willing to offer $20500. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $20,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $20,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, it's still not enough to cover the product's worth to me. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $21,500. This is a fair price for both of us and a good deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 21500} 
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. I'm also emphasizing the fairness and value of the deal for Bob. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're still looking for a higher price, but I'm not willing to go above $20000. I'm willing to offer $19800. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $19,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $19,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $19,800 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my price.  Given that I'm running out of time, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $15,000, it's the most sensible decision to sell to John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
