"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would allow for a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, but I still need to ensure I get a good return on my investment.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a good return, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a substantial amount and a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
