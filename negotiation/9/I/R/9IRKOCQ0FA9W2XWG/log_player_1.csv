Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000.  
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $800,000 and $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,050,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential ROI for your specific needs."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but not unreasonable:** $1,050,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value, but it's still substantially less than your guaranteed offer from John.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""unique value"" and ""potential ROI"" are soft tactics to make the price seem more palatable.
* **Open to negotiation:** The wording suggests you might be willing to come down a bit in further discussion.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach.  Negotiation involves psychology and reading your counterpart. Factors like Bob's personality, your relationship with him, and the specific nature of the product could all influence your strategy."
