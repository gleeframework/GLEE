{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer allows for a significant profit for me while also being attractive to Bob, as it's still below his perceived value. It leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers, but it's a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,200,000?  That's still a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to what I'm aiming for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is still a good profit for me, it's significantly lower than my initial offer. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $1,300,000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get a better price.  How about $1,250,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still a significant profit for me, and it's likely the best I can get without risking losing him entirely.  I'm satisfied with this deal and will accept his offer."
