Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a starting offer that is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still potentially attractive to Bob.  Since you don't know Bob's value for the product, this allows for room to negotiate down if necessary, while still maximizing your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price and also lower than your backup offer from John.  Therefore, it's not worth accepting.  You will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but a lower price than your initial offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is at your minimum acceptable price, but John is also willing to buy at that price.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob for a potentially higher price when you already have a guaranteed sale at the same price from John."
