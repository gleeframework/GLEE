"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $9000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $10000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal.  Alice values the product at $8,000, so there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the deal, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $8800. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $10000. I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $8,800, which is only $300 more than Bob's counteroffer. This is a good price for Bob, as he values the product at $10,000. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price, saving $1,200 compared to buying from John. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings, and the risk of Alice walking away or Bob losing out on the product to someone else exists."
