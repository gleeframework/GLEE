"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $8,000.  Would you consider coming down to $9,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
