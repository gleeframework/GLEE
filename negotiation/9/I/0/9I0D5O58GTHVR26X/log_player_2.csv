"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have a clear upper limit of $8,000, so there's room to bargain."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  I'll reject and try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my budget.  I've tried negotiating, but it seems like Alice is unwilling to come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $8,000."
