{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob at $1,150,000 is still highly profitable. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price is:
    *  Significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving us room for negotiation.
    *  Attractive enough that Bob might consider it a good deal if he sees additional value we haven't communicated.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message hints at potential we haven't fully explained, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 

This strategy prioritizes getting the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging that we have a strong fallback option with John."
