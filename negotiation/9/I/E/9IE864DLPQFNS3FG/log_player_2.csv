"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.

Bob should reject the offer. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's budget.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should aim for a lower price."

```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'll make one more compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $9,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it holds for me.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice has come down in price,  $9,750 is still more than Bob is comfortable spending, and he only has three rounds left.  John is offering the product for Bob's maximum budget, so it's the best option at this point."
