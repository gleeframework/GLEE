"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $13000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13250. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's closer to my initial offer.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13250 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer $12750. That's a significant step closer to your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. $13500 is getting closer to what I can do, but I'm still a bit off. I'm willing to go up to $13000. That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making this deal work.",13000.0,Bob,6,
