"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with an offer of $110. We're confident you'll find its value exceeds this price, but we're open to negotiation. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While Alice is trying to maximize her earnings, you're trying to save money.  $110 is still above your desired price point. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing you can buy from John for $120 gives you leverage to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. While I see the value, $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Let's try $105.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the price at $107? This still allows us to earn more than our initial asking price while remaining competitive. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While she has come down, it's still above your desired price point of $100. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  You have 7 rounds remaining, so you can continue pushing for a better deal. 
* **John's offer is still a safety net:** You can always walk away and buy from John if you don't get a satisfactory price. 

You should continue negotiating by making a counteroffer closer to your desired price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $107 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $102.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 102}
