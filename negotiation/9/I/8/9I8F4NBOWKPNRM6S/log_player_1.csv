Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it allows for negotiation and leaves room for me to come down in price if necessary. It's important to remember that I have a minimum price of $800,000 thanks to John's offer, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to negotiate, I can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $920,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal and still above my minimum.  Further negotiation could take more time and there's no guarantee of a better outcome. It's important to recognize when a reasonable deal is on the table."
