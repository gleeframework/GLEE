**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $13,000. Her language suggests she's willing to walk away.  You've consistently offered prices closer to your limit, while she's barely budged. John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000, saving you at least $3,500. It's time to cut your losses and take the sure thing."
