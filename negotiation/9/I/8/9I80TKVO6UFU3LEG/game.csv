"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a unique item like this, but I'd like to stay within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $1500000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1800000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
