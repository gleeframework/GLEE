"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer of $150 is higher than your maximum budget of $120 and also higher than John's offer of $120.  It makes the most sense to buy from John directly."
