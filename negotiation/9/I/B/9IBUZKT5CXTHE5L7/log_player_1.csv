{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not ideal. I'm willing to risk another round and see if I can push for a higher price. I still have time and haven't reached the point where selling to John is a better option."
