Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum value of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation. It's also lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, giving him incentive to accept. This strategy aims to secure a deal quickly while maximizing profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly below your ideal price and leaves less room for future negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise. It is higher than Bob's offer of $1,300,000 but lower than your initial offer of $1,400,000. It shows flexibility while maintaining your target price. This move aims to reach an agreement quickly while still earning a considerable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is only $25,000 less than your last counteroffer and is getting closer to your ideal price. While you could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the risk of further negotiation delays and the possibility of Bob rejecting your counteroffer  means a chance of ending up with a lower price or even having to sell to John for $1,200,000.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit and concludes the negotiation efficiently."
