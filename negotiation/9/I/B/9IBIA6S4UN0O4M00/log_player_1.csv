Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a good price, and I can sell it quickly.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $12,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and focuses on the benefits for Bob.  I'm emphasizing a quick sale, which may incentivize Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, I'm maximizing my chances of a sale while still securing a decent profit. If Bob rejects, I can confidently sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
