Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, hoping to maximize my profit. However, I'm leaving room for negotiation, as John is a guaranteed buyer at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price than $150.  I'll counter with a lower price in the next round to try and reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm lowering my price to $165, which is still higher than Bob's initial offer but closer to his perceived value.  This shows flexibility and increases the likelihood of reaching a deal while still ensuring a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is firm on his price, and I'm not willing to go lower than $150.  Since John is a guaranteed buyer at that price, I'll sell the product to him and avoid further negotiations."
