"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see some flexibility on your end. I'm thinking of a price around $900000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  However, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1100000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it shows my commitment to working with you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm confident that's a fair price for a product that's worth $1000000 to you.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your interest in this product and I'm still eager to work with you. However, $850000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to drop my price to $950000.  This is a significant concession, and I truly believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to see a bit more flexibility. How about $925000?",925000.0,Bob,6,
