Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $12,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that value as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer the product to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $11,500}

This is a reasonable offer that should be attractive to Bob, but still allows me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still higher than what I would get from selling to John. I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get closer to the product's value to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob was willing to pay $11,000, I'll try to get closer to that amount. I'll make a counteroffer of:

{""product_price"": $11,250}

This is a reasonable compromise that should be attractive to Bob, while still giving me a bit more profit than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is sticking to his initial offer of $11,000. I've already rejected that offer once, and I'm not sure if I want to go back to that price. Considering the alternative of selling to John for $10,000, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell the product to John for $10,000, which is a decent profit for me, even if it's not as much as I could have gotten from Bob."
