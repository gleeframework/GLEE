,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $17,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know if that's a starting point we can work with.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great value for you considering the product's worth. Let's meet in the middle.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $13,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly further and offer the product for $14,500. This is a final compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",14500.0,Alice,7,
