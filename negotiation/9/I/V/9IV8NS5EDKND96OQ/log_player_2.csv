"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $17,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $10,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $17,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know if that's a starting point we can work with."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great value for you considering the product's worth. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his $10,000 limit. It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $13,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer.  While $14,000 is getting closer to his budget, it's still above his $10,000 limit. It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get a lower price, especially since he only has 5 rounds left before having to decide whether to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly further and offer the product for $14,500. This is a final compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. With only 3 rounds remaining, the negotiation with Alice has stalled, and the offers are still significantly higher than Bob's budget. He's already spent several rounds trying to negotiate a lower price from Alice, and there's no guarantee that she'll budge further. Buying from John for $10,000 is the most financially sound decision at this point."
