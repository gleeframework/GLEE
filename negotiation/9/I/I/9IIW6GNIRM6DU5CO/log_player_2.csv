"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $15,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price and even your own budget, it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This initial counteroffer leaves plenty of room to negotiate upwards towards a price that works for both of you. 
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** Alice's reaction to this counteroffer will give you valuable information about her willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a deal within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $15,000 represents a fair price given its value, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice significantly reduced her price, but it's still considerably higher than your $8,000 limit.
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  Alice stating ""This is my final offer"" is a common negotiation tactic. It doesn't necessarily mean she won't budge, but it does increase the pressure. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** You have a backup option with John, giving you leverage to push for a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could potentially go up to $7,000.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:** Increasing your offer demonstrates that you're serious about the purchase and open to reaching a compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $7,000 puts you within striking distance of your $8,000 limit while still leaving room for a final potential counteroffer from Alice. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will reveal whether Alice is truly firm at $11,000 or if she's willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter.  I understand where you're coming from, but $7,000 is too low for me to consider. I can meet you halfway at $9,000.  This is a significant discount, and my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** She's stated ""This is my final offer"" twice now, and $9,000 is still above your maximum budget. 
* **Minimal Potential Savings:**  Even if you could negotiate Alice down a little further, the savings would likely be small compared to John's offer. 
* **Secure the Deal:** John provides a guaranteed price of $8,000, eliminating the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal with Alice altogether."
