"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $15,000 represents a fair price given its value, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could potentially go up to $7,000.  Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter.  I understand where you're coming from, but $7,000 is too low for me to consider. I can meet you halfway at $9,000.  This is a significant discount, and my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,
