"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $950,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. There's a lot of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000."", 
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer allows for more negotiation room.  There's a chance Alice might accept a price much lower than her initial offer, especially since it's still considerably more than half her product's worth to her.  Even if she rejects it, we can gauge her response and adjust accordingly in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice has met your maximum budget. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or buying from John, as you won't get a better price."
