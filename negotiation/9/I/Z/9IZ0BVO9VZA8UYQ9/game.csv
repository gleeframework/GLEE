"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that 150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as 80. How about we meet in the middle at 110? It's a fair price for a great product like this.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but 110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to pay $95 for it - that's a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as 95, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about we meet at 105? It's still a good price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise.",105.0,Alice,5,
