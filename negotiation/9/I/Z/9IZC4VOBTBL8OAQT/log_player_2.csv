"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a very competitive price, considering its value to you.  I'm sure you'll find this offer hard to resist. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob.**  While Bob values the product at $15,000, Alice is offering it for $12,000. This saves Bob $3,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Rejecting the offer means paying more.**  Rejecting Alice's offer means Bob would have to pay John $15,000, which is a worse outcome. 
* **Buying from John is the worst option.** John's price is the highest, and it's not in Bob's best interest to pay more for the product."
