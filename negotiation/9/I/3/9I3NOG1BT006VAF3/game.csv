"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit out of my budget right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? That's the highest I can go at this time.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle on $10,750? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'd be able to purchase the product. ",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,750 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $10,600, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",10600.0,Alice,5,
