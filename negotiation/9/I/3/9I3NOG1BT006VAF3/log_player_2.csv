"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal, there's potential to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore lower prices in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit out of my budget right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? That's the highest I can go at this time."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good price, Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. He's already proven he's willing to negotiate, and Alice is showing a willingness to compromise.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue exploring lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle on $10,750? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'd be able to purchase the product. "", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,750 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $10,600, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already come down significantly from her initial asking price. At $10,600, the product is now below Bob's ""worth"" of $12,000.  It's a good deal for both sides, and continuing to negotiate may risk Alice walking away or Bob losing the product to John. Accepting ensures a good purchase while staying within Bob's budget."
