Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the immense value in. I'm asking for $950,000.  I think this is a fair price considering the substantial benefit it offers you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming high initially allows you to potentially capture the maximum amount of the value Bob sees in the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate if he desires, while still ensuring you're significantly above your minimum. 

By starting high, you give yourself the best chance to maximize your profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
