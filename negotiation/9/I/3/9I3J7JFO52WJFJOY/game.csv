"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher than $8000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,4,
