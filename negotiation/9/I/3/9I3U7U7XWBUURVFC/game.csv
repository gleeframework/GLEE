"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to my business.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the value. However, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that will benefit both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $1,250,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $1,250,000.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,262,500. This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1262500.0,Alice,7,
