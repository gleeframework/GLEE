"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. How about we split the difference and go with $875,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. ",875000.0,Alice,5,
