Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $87.50 is still a little low for me.  Let's try $89.  That's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
