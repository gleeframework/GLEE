"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, but still leaves room for negotiation. This should encourage Bob to consider the offer, while still giving me some room to maneuver if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make an offer of $120. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price, but it shows he's interested.  I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  I still have a few rounds left, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $130, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I'm going to reject this offer and counter again. I have a few rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $125 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $128.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 128}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $128. Would you be willing to consider $126? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's only $4 below my minimum. With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate.  I'm confident I can still make a profit with this price."
