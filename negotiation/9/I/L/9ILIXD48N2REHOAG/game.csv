"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which I think is a fair starting point considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer that's closer to your budget while still reflecting the product's value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my target price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $12,000, which is $10,500. This is a reasonable compromise that should work for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and should be closer to your target. Let's work together to bridge this small gap.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $12,000, which is $10,750. This is a fair compromise that should work for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,7,
