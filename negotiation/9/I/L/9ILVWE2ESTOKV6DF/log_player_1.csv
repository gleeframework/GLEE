Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at the special price of $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, even exceeding the $12,000 you estimate.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still make it attractive for Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly below your maximum allows for potential counter-offers from Bob.
* **Highlight Value:** The message subtly reminds Bob that the product is worth more than his initial assessment, potentially increasing its perceived value.

By offering the product at $14,500, Alice has a good chance of securing a sale with Bob while still earning a significant profit. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has the security of selling to John for her minimum desired price."
