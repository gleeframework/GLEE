,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to accept $7,500 for the product?  I'm really interested in buying it, and I think this price is fair considering its value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is the lowest I can go. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it very beneficial.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $8,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,375 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,100 for the product.  This is a very fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?",8100.0,Bob,6,
