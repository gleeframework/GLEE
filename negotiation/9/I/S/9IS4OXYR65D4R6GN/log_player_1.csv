"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $8,500 is still too low, but I want to see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $9000. How about $8750? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. $8,750 is still too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be at $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $9250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $9000. If you're willing to meet me at $9000, I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  I've already rejected a few of his offers, and I don't want to push him away completely. $9,000 is a decent outcome, and I can use the money to potentially invest in something else or just keep it as savings."
