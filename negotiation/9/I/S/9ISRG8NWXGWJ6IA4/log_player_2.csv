"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a low offer gives me more room to negotiate. While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's important to establish a starting point that benefits me. Alice might be willing to come down considerably, especially since she values the product at $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down in price, $9,000 is still above my maximum budget and what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I'm eager to make this work and believe this price is fair."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Instead of jumping up too high, offering $7,000 shows Alice I'm willing to move, but also keeps me within a reasonable range of my $8,000 limit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning my eagerness might subtly encourage Alice to accept, especially if she's keen on making a sale. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** There's still a $1,000 buffer between my offer and John's price, allowing some flexibility if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $8,500, which is above both my budget and John's offer. It's unlikely she'll go lower, and I'm content with purchasing from John at $8,000.  There's no point in further negotiation when I have a guaranteed option at my desired price point."
