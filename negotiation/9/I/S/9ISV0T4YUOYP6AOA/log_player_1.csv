Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $100 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer it to him for $90.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $85 is lower than my minimum price of $90, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer to try to get closer to my desired price.
