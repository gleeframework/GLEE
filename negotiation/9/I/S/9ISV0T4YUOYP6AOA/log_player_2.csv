"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is less than John's price, it's still more than the product is worth to you.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $85, which is a fair price considering the product is worth $80 to her and $100 to me. This offer leaves some room for negotiation and allows me to potentially save more than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $87 is better than my counteroffer of $85 and is also less than John's price of $100.  Accepting this offer is the best option to save money and get the product."
