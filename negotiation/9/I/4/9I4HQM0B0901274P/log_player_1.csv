{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's less than half of my minimum value, and it doesn't reflect the worth of the product. I need to counteroffer and try to reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $14,000. This is still well above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm going to try one more time with a counteroffer of $12,500. This is just above my minimum value and shows that I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm not going to go any lower. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. It's clear that Bob is trying to get the lowest price possible. I'm confident that I can get at least $12,000 from John, so I'll sell to him."
