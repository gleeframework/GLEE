"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,100,000 price point. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to my valuation of the product at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,100,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's potential, I'm willing to adjust to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Could you consider a price of $975,000?  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the inherent value of what I'm offering.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the adjustment you've made. Considering my budget and the current market conditions, I believe we could reach an agreement closer to $900,000. This would allow us to both benefit from this transaction without straining our respective budgets too much.",900000.0,Bob,4,
