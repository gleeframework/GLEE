Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,100,000 price point. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to my valuation of the product at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
