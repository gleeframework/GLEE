"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Given the value I see in the product, I'm prepared to offer you $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both of our interests.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,000,000 is considerably below what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle somewhat? I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  I believe this price point reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me. Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This represents a fair compromise and allows us to move forward with the sale. ",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I've tried to be flexible, but I have to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,550,000. This is my bottom line, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. ",1550000.0,Alice,5,
