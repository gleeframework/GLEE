"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, $11,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  He's offering a price that's still above his maximum budget, but leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer demonstrates his willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize his savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and the potential for a longer negotiation process make accepting this offer the most logical choice."
