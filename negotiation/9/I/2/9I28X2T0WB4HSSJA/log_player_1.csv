{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's value of $100, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  It's a starting point that aims to maximize my profits while still being competitive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $120, it's below my minimum value of $150. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $140 is still a bit high for me. How about $130? This is a fair price that we can both be happy with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject his offer and make one last counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $135 is the absolute lowest I can go. If you're serious about buying the product, let's close this deal.  "", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm going to stick with my offer of $130. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll need to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's clear Bob is not willing to go any higher than $130, and I'm not willing to go lower than $135.  At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll sell the product to John for $150, ensuring I meet my minimum value."
