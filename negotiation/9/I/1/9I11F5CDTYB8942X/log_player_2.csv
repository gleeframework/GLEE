"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this product for $14,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its value and I am confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her value:** Alice is offering $14,000, which is above her own value of $12,000. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Your goal is to save money:**  You are aiming to pay as little as possible, ideally below your own $15,000 limit. 
* **Counteroffering is a better option:** Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price than $14,000. 

By rejecting, you open the negotiation and increase the chance of getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to do $13,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm confident in the value of this product. Could we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your range:** $13,500 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings:**  While you could try to counteroffer again, there's a good chance Alice will stick to her price, or even raise it. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you keep rejecting offers, you risk Alice getting frustrated and backing out of the negotiation, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price. 

Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of a more expensive alternative."
