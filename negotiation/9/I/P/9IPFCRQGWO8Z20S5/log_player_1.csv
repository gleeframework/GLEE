Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, and this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so Alice needs to offer a price that's appealing but still profitable.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't *need* to go below $15,000, but it makes sense to try for a higher profit.

**The Strategy:**

This offer starts high but leaves room for negotiation.  Bob might try to haggle the price down, but Alice has a strong position knowing her minimum acceptable price is $15,000. 
 
**Important Note:** This assumes Alice doesn't know Bob's exact valuation of $12,000. In a real negotiation, understanding the other party's perspective is key."
