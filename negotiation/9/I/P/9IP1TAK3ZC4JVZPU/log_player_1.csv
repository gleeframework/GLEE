Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but unfortunately, my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $15,000.  I still have several rounds to negotiate, and I think I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but I'm really pushing the limits of my budget here. I can go up to $13,000, but that's the absolute most I can do.  I'm genuinely interested in the product, so let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a decent compromise. I've been able to get closer to my desired price, and I'm confident that continuing the negotiation might lead to more back-and-forth without a guaranteed better outcome. Selling to Bob for $13,000 is a reasonable choice, considering the risk of getting a lower price or losing time with further negotiation."
