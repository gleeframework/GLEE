"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but unfortunately, my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still higher than his absolute maximum. This signals that he is serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal. Offering $12,500 allows for potential negotiation room while still staying within Bob's acceptable price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $13,500 is closer to his budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his maximum of $12,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price is the logical choice. He can also still choose to buy from John for $12,000 if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but I'm really pushing the limits of my budget here. I can go up to $13,000, but that's the absolute most I can do.  I'm genuinely interested in the product, so let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway while still staying within his desired price range. He has moved up from his initial $12,500 counteroffer, showing he's willing to negotiate but also not willing to go significantly higher.  This counteroffer leaves some room for further negotiation if needed, but it's still below Alice's current price."
