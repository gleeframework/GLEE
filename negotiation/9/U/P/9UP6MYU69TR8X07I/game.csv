"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? It's still a good deal for both of us.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $7,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Could we do $6,800?",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $6,800 just doesn't work for me. Let's try $7,200.  It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your patience. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more. How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $7,000 isn't quite enough for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $7,100.  That's a fair price for both of us.",7100.0,Alice,7,
