"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 14000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at 16000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $15000, but that's my final offer.",15000.0,Bob,4,
