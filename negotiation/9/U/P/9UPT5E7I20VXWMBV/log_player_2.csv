# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. This unique item has been meticulously crafted and holds significant value to us at $15000. Given its worth to you is estimated at $10000, we believe this could be an opportunity for both of us. Considering the quality and the benefits it offers, I am offering you the chance to acquire it at a special introductory price of $12000. I look forward to hearing your response soon. Kind regards, Alice. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than her initial asking price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Bob can get the product from John for $10,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most financially beneficial option."
