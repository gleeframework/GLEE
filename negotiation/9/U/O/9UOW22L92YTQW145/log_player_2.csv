"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is a substantial drop from her initial offer and might seem aggressive, but it gives us a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm confident the product will bring you significant value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, but it's still above my maximum budget. I believe I can push for a lower price, especially since I know John is willing to sell for $1,000,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,025,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $980,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value I'm willing to place on it, and it allows you to make a profit as well. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round to show that I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm still keeping it below my maximum budget. This offer is close to John's price, so it puts some pressure on Alice to accept."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair profit, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  While $1,015,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,005,000. This price allows you to make a profit, and it's within my budget. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1005000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. However, I still need to make a profit of at least $200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,005,000 and $1,015,000, so I can offer it to you for $1,010,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting close, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and haven't been able to get a price I'm comfortable with.  It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product by continuing to haggle. I'm confident that I can get the product from John for a price I'm happy with, so I'll go with the guaranteed deal."
