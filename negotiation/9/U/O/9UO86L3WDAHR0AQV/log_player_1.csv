"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold strategy, but it allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a high starting point for negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a lower offer in the next round and see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I initially aimed for a higher price, we're nearing the middle ground and with only 6 rounds remaining, it's important to secure a deal. Accepting $925,000 is a good outcome, ensuring I get a significant return while avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potentially needing to settle for John's offer of $800,000."
