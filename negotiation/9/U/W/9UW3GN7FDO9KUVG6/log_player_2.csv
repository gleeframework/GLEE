# Alice's message: I like the way you think, Bob! Meeting in the middle is a great idea. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $112.50. It's a small premium, but I think it's worth it for a great product like this.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the way you're thinking, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $112.50 again. I know we've been close before, but I really think this product is worth it to you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It seems like Alice is stuck at $112.50. While that's a decent price, we're running out of rounds and I'm not confident she'll go any lower.  It's time to cut our losses and buy from John for $150. It's not the ideal price, but it's better than risking no deal at all."
