Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation.
* **Offering a deal:**  I'm framing the price as a ""deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Remaining open to negotiation:** By not going for my absolute minimum, I'm signaling I'm open to some give-and-take.  

This initial offer sets a starting point for negotiation while keeping my profit potential in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would mean a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and he's made a counteroffer.  There's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price within a reasonable range.

I will counteroffer Bob to try and get a better price, aiming for something closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $140? That would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:**  $140 is a compromise, bridging the gap between Bob's offer and my minimum. 
* **Highlighting the deal:**  I'm again emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of value.
* **Showing flexibility:**  I've lowered my price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Not giving away too much:**  $140 is still significantly above Bob's offer, ensuring I'm not sacrificing too much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While he's shown a willingness to negotiate, $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Time is a factor:**  Negotiations can be time-consuming.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, offering a more certain and convenient outcome. 

I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure I achieve my minimum profit goal without further negotiation."
