"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, and $10,000 is a bit too low for me. Let me see what I can do. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $12,500. This is the lowest price I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let me see... I can offer you the product for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,5,
