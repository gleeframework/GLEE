Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, and $10,000 is a bit too low for me. Let me see what I can do. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $12,500. This is the lowest price I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let me see... I can offer you the product for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go below $12,500 and has even stated $13,000 is her final offer. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $12,000."
