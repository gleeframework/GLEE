"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $8,500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer of $8,000.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price that is within both of our limits, and allows us to close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500, which is $10,000. I'm also considering the fact that I could sell the product to John for $10,000, so I'm willing to make this final compromise. Let's make a deal at $10,000!",10000.0,Alice,7,
