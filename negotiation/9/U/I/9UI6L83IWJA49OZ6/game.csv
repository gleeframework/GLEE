"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $100 to you. Considering its value, I would like to propose a price of $95 for it. I hope this offer aligns with your expectations.",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget constraints. To meet in the middle, I would like to propose a price of $85 for the product. This allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another offer of $78. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get as close to my target price as possible.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground. How about we set the product price at $82? This is higher than your last offer but lower than mine, aiming for a compromise that works for both of us.",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $82 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to try to get even closer to my target price. How about we meet at $77? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",77.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Considering your latest offer, I believe we're getting closer. How about we set the product price at $80? This is slightly above your offer but still below my initial proposal, aiming for a fair deal for both parties.",80.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $80 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $79? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",79.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I see where you're coming from, Bob. Let's aim for a price that respects both our positions. How about we agree on $79.50 for the product? It's a slight adjustment from your last offer, but I believe it strikes a good balance.",79.5,Alice,9,
