,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $12000, which is my minimum. I believe this is still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000. Can you consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $10500?  I believe this price is fair, and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
