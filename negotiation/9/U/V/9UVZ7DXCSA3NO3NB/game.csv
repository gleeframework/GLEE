"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. This product is a rare find and I'm willing to let it go for a price that I think you'll find reasonable. I'm thinking of starting at $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $12,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000 either. Let's meet in the middle at $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000.  It's the most I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $13,500? I think it's a good compromise, considering the value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  However, $13,500 is still a bit beyond my means.  Let's try $13,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet at $13,250? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,7,
