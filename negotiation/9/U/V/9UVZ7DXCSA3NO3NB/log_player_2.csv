"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. This product is a rare find and I'm willing to let it go for a price that I think you'll find reasonable. I'm thinking of starting at $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high.  Bob should reject and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $12,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000 either. Let's meet in the middle at $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject the offer. While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He can try to negotiate further or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000.  It's the most I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $13,500? I think it's a good compromise, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and he has the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  However, $13,500 is still a bit beyond my means.  Let's try $13,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet at $13,250? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, $13,250 is still above what Bob is willing to pay. Bob has already had several rounds of negotiation and is getting closer to the end of his allotted rounds. Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially a final price still above his budget, Bob should choose to buy from John for $12,000.  This guarantees the product at his maximum price and avoids further negotiation risk."
