Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $860,000. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I believe the product's value is worth more than your last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What are your thoughts on this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $860,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $860,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  While we've been getting closer, I don't think we will reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. It's better to go with the guaranteed price from John rather than risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation."
