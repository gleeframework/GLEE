"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,300,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I'm happy to purchase the product for $1,250,000. This price would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it represents a good value for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
