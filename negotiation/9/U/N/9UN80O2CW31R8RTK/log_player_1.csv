Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you considering my previous offer.  While I see the value in the product, $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
The latest offer from Bob at $13,000 is higher than his initial perceived value of $12,000, indicating he might be willing to stretch his budget. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit above John's offer.
