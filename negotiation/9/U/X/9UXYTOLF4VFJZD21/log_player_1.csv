Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,200,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see that you're still holding firm at $1,300,000, which is a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose $1,250,000 as a compromise. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $1,250,000 is a good compromise, and it's closer to my desired price than John's offer. I'd rather close the deal now than risk losing Bob and ending up with John's lower offer."
