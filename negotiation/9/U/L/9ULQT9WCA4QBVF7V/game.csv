"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from its true worth to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. This is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and my previous offer of $950000, which would be $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
