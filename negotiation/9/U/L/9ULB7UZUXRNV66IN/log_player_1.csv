Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. It's incredibly valuable, and I believe it would be a significant asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000,  I want to start with a significantly higher offer to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can always lower it, knowing my minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number, I'm trying to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, the starting point might influence him to agree to a price higher than $1,000,000.

**It's important to note:** This strategy involves some risk. Bob might be completely turned off by the high price and refuse to negotiate. However, the potential reward of selling it for significantly more than $1,000,000 makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
