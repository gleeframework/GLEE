```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $88 is a good compromise.  It's closer to my desired price of $85, and I'm comfortable accepting it.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that I could lose the deal altogether.  I'm confident that I've saved enough money by securing the product for $88 compared to John's price of $100."
