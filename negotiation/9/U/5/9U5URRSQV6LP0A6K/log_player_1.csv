Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is unlikely to go much higher and we are getting close to John's offer. Accepting the $925,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely."
