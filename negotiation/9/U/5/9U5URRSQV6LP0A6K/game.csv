"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is undeniable, and $900,000 significantly undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's say $1,000,000. This reflects the product's true worth while still offering you a great deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me on this. To show you I'm serious about making this deal happen, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market value.",925000.0,Bob,6,
