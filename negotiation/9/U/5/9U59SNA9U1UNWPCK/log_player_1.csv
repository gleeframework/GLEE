"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, higher than my minimum but hopefully not too high for Bob to immediately reject.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer (or lack thereof)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's low offer, I'm not willing to sell for my minimum just yet.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  There's a chance Bob might increase his offer if I show I'm not desperate to sell immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $175. This is a compromise that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but still keeps me above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is closer to my desired price than his previous offer, and I'm getting closer to the end of the rounds. Accepting this offer seems like the best option at this point."
