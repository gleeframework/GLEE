Round 2
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently moving upwards in his offers, indicating willingness to buy. We're still significantly above John's offer, leaving room for negotiation. Holding firm now might push Bob to accept a price closer to our desired range in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you see the value in this product. To avoid further back and forth, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:** We're reaching the later rounds, and dragging negotiations for too long risks losing Bob.  
* **Strong Position:** We're still significantly above John's offer, providing a safety net.
* **Finality:** Presenting this as our ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and may prompt Bob to accept, especially since it's a round number."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $990,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $990,000 is a significant profit, well above John's offer and close to our ""final offer"" price.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to push might alienate Bob and risk him walking away. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Trying to squeeze out a few thousand more dollars at this stage isn't worth potentially losing the deal altogether."
