"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as possible. Can you meet me in the middle?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about $13,750? That's a good middle ground, and it still leaves you with a significant profit.  What do you say?",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $13,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $13,750. How about $13,375? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",13375.0,Bob,4,
