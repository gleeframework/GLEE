Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,750,000?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above the budget I'm looking to stay within. How about we try $1,400,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired amount without further negotiation."
