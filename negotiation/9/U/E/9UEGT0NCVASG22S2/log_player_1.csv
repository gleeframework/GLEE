"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($18,000) to leave room for negotiation. I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, so this gives me a good buffer. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" and emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is inviting Bob to counteroffer, signaling that I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** While $15,000 is a decent price, it's still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I can likely get more if I continue negotiating.
* **Time is on My Side:** I have 8 rounds left, and I haven't used my ability to sell to John yet. I'm not in a rush. 
* **Exploring Value:**  Bob's counteroffer gives me valuable information. It suggests that he's willing to pay a bit more than my minimum, and that I may be able to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($18,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($15,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good price.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Open to Further Discussion:** My message is inviting Bob to continue the dialogue.  I want to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** Although Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, there's still room for improvement. I'm not desperate to sell, and I can likely get a better deal.
* **Strategic Delay:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can buy myself more time to explore if he's genuinely willing to go higher or if he's using a stalling tactic.
* **Maintaining Value:** My counteroffers so far have kept the price above my minimum. I want to avoid dropping too low too early in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000. That's a significant price reduction, and I'm confident we can reach a final agreement. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** This offer shows a willingness to compromise further while still keeping the price above my minimum. 
* **Appeal to Common Ground:** I'm emphasizing our shared goal of reaching an agreement. This helps build rapport and suggests a collaborative approach.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a touch of urgency by mentioning a ""final agreement."" This subtly suggests that I might be more likely to accept John's offer if we don't come to terms soon.

**Strategy:**

By offering $15,000, I'm testing the waters to see if Bob is truly willing to pay closer to my minimum acceptable price or if he's simply trying to push for a lower price. This round is crucial for gauging his intentions and potentially closing the deal at a favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $1,500 above my minimum acceptable price. It's tempting, but I'm not desperate.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** There are still a few rounds left. I can use this time to try to push Bob a bit higher, or gauge if he's willing to move further.
* **Avoiding Premature Sale:** Selling to John for $12,000 is always an option, but I'm not convinced that Bob won't come up a bit more.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping to secure a price closer to $14,000. This round is about carefully assessing the situation and determining whether I can get a better deal with Bob or if it's time to secure the guaranteed price from John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  To make this happen, I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's last offer ($13,500) and my previous offer ($15,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm still framing this offer as a good deal based on the product's value.
* **Urgency (Subtle):** The phrase ""finding a solution that works for both of us"" hints at the possibility of a deadline or my willingness to explore other options if we can't agree. 

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming to test the waters one more time to see if I can get Bob to come up to my preferred price. I've already conceded a lot, but I'm not willing to go lower than $14,500 at this point. This round is about making a final push for a better deal before potentially accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds remaining, the risk of not closing a deal with anyone increases.
* **Low Margin:** Bob's offer is only $1,000 above my minimum, leaving very little profit.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price. While it's not the ideal scenario, it ensures a secure outcome.

**Strategy:**

At this point, it's wiser to secure the guaranteed sale with John than to gamble on further negotiation with Bob. The time constraint and the low margin of Bob's offer make it unlikely that I'll be able to secure a significantly better deal in the remaining rounds."
