I'm starting high, at $1,700,000.  This is above Bob's value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm willing to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000. This is still a good profit for me and closer to Bob's value. I'm hoping he'll see that this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer to my desired price point.  While I'd prefer more, the risk of further negotiation might result in a lower offer or a stalemate.  I'll accept his offer and secure a sale."
