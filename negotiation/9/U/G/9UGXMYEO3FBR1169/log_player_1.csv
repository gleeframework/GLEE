I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,750,000. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

This allows for some room to negotiate if he counters, but it also puts pressure on him to make a deal quickly since he knows I have another buyer willing to pay my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,600,000. This is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it shows a willingness to compromise and gives Bob an opportunity to close the deal without needing to go back and forth further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is too low and I'm getting impatient. I've already made concessions and I'm not willing to drop my price any further.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, so I'm going to go with that option."
