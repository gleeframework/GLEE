"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about $8,500?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  I think that's a fair price that lets us both get a good deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,000?  This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,100, but that's my final offer. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",9100.0,Alice,5,
