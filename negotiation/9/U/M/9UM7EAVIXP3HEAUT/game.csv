,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,5,
