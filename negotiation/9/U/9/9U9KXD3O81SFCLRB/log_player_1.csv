Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value that I'm confident you'll recognize. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about we try $1,550,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,550,000 is the best move at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $1,550,000 is a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations has the risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal quickly allows me to utilize the funds for other opportunities. 
 
While selling to John is an option, it nets the same amount as Bob's current offer and continuing with Bob has the potential to earn even more."
