"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $950000? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get closer to your target, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice, but $1050000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to get closer to my budget. How about we meet at $980000? I'm willing to make a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice, but $1020000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. How about we meet at $990000? This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",990000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm sorry, Alice, but I've reached my limit. I'm not willing to go any higher than $990000. I'm starting to think it's time to explore other options. I'd like to thank you for the negotiation, but I think I'll have to look elsewhere for a better deal.",990000.0,Bob,10,
