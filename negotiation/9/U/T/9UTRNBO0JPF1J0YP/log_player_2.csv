You can do better than $100. It's worth rejecting the offer and counter-offering."

Alice's offer:

While $92.50 is a good deal, you've already established a solid lower price point with John. There's no guarantee you'll be able to get Alice any lower, and it's likely the negotiations will drag on.  It's best to go with the guaranteed $80 price from John."
