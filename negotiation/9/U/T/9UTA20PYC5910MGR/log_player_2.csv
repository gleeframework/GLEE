"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for a price that's significantly lower than its true worth to me. I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,250,000.  This is a great opportunity to acquire a product that will benefit you immensely, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Therefore, it's more beneficial for Bob to reject Alice's offer and purchase the product from John for a lower price."
