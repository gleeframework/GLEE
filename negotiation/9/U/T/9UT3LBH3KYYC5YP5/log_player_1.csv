"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, knowing that the product is worth $12,000 to me and $8,000 to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value the product offers Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:** While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price.  
* **Time Limit:** With 10 rounds, I still have ample time to try to reach a better agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $9,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. Let's close this deal and get this product in your hands."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Negotiation:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the value the product offers to him, hoping to encourage him to see the benefit of a slightly higher price.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm emphasizing the desire to ""close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,200. Can you consider this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Progress:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially push for a higher price.
* **Time Remaining:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to explore further negotiation without rushing into a suboptimal deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $9,300 for the product.  This is a final offer that reflects both our needs. Let's make this happen. "", ""product_price"": 9300}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This offer signals a clear indication that I am nearing my limit and am not willing to go any lower.
* **Compromise:** This offer is a small compromise, showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway but still maintaining a profit margin. 
* **Urgency:**  Using phrases like ""final offer"" and ""make this happen"" creates urgency,  hoping to push Bob to accept before he considers alternatives."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Time Remaining:** With 4 rounds left, I still have time to push for a higher price. 
* **John as a Backup:** I can always sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through.
* **Holding Firm:** It's important to hold firm on my desired price point, as further concessions could lead to a lower final price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $9,000 is just not feasible for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,150.  This is a final compromise on my end, and it's the best price I can offer. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer signals that I am very close to my minimum acceptable price and am not willing to go any lower.
* **Meeting Halfway:** By offering $9,150, I am demonstrating a willingness to compromise again, showing flexibility. 
* **Urgency:**  Again, emphasizing a final offer and using phrases like ""make this happen"" creates urgency, pushing Bob to accept. 
* **Potential Agreement:**  The $9,150 offer is closer to my desired price and closer to Bob's previous offer, creating potential for an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,800. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,800 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Limited Rounds:** We are down to our last two rounds.  The time to negotiate is running out. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, which is far more profitable than what Bob is offering. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks ending up with a price lower than John's offer. 

Therefore, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John and secure a profitable deal."
