"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves room for negotiation but still gives me a good profit.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is too low for me.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a fair price considering the product's value to Bob. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$110 is still too low for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and try to get a better price in the next round. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $125.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value.  We're getting close to the middle ground, and hopefully, Bob will recognize that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and haven't been able to get him to budge much. I'm running out of time, and John is willing to pay my minimum.  It's best to sell to John and avoid further risk of getting a lower price from Bob."
