"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? This still leaves you with a good deal, considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $10,750 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,875. It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",10875.0,Alice,5,
