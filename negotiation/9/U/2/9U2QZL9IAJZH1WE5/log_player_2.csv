Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $10,750 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,875. It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's unlikely to go much lower than this. Accepting at $10,875 gets you a decent discount and avoids the risk of the deal falling through entirely."
