"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a special price of $9500. This is a great opportunity to get a high-value item at a price that's still very attractive. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer, but still above your maximum value.** You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is asking for $9,500.
* **You can potentially negotiate with Alice.** By rejecting her initial offer, you demonstrate your willingness to walk away, which might encourage her to lower her price. 
* **The worst-case scenario is buying from John.**  While rejecting Alice's offer doesn't guarantee a better deal, it opens the possibility for a more favorable outcome."
