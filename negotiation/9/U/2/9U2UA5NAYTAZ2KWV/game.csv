"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 still falls short of my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 as a final compromise. It's a significant price reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my desire to reach an agreement. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll seriously consider it.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
