Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175.,175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $175 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $100 either. Let me see if I can meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $137.50.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $137.50 is still above my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $118.75?",118.75,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $118.75. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll sell it to you for $151.50.",151.5,Alice,5,
