"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good chunk of the value difference between our valuations. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a significant profit.  This shows flexibility, and I'm confident I can reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to secure a higher price.  There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but still keeping a good margin. This shows that I'm committed to a deal, but also willing to compromise. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price, and we are in the middle of the negotiation.  While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, the risk of continuing negotiation and losing the deal is higher than the potential gain."
