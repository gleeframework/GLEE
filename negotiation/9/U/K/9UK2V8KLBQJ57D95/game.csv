"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is still a fair price given the product's value to you.  I'm confident this price benefits both of us. Let's try to work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
