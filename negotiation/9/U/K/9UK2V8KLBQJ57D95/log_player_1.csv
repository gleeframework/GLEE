{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation and potential profit for both of you.
* **It shows a willingness to negotiate:** By stating your offer as ""fair,"" you imply flexibility and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I expect to get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than the initial offer I made.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value to you.  I'm confident this price benefits both of us. Let's try to work together to find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer and close to the middle ground between my last counteroffer and his previous offer. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a potential deal breakdown."
