"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. My starting price is $115. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $105?  That's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $105 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $100. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that.  However, $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  How about $101.25? It's closer to your offer, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",101.25,Alice,5,
