"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. My starting price is $115. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility on price. It also signals that we are serious buyers but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $105?  That's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our ideal price and what John offers. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  $105 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $100. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $97.50?"",
 ""product_price"": 97.50
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We acknowledge Alice's willingness to negotiate by saying $105 is ""closer.""
* **Target Price:** We reiterate our price range to remind Alice of our budget.
* **Specific Counter:** Suggesting $97.50, the exact midpoint, makes it seem like a fair and reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that.  However, $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  How about $101.25? It's closer to your offer, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly very attached to getting over $100. While she might come down slightly again, it's unlikely to be a significant drop. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are minimal compared to the guaranteed price from John. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product for $100 from John."
