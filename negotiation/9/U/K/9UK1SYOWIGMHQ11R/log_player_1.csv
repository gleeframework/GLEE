Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a price of $14,000. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and this is a competitive offer."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offered price is slightly below your guaranteed price but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of a ""good deal"" for Bob while still leaving you with a substantial profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message is open to negotiation. If Bob counters, you have the option to slightly lower the price while still remaining above your minimum.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If he rejects it, you still have the safety net of John's offer at $15,000."
