Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but based on my research and budget, I am unable to meet the price of $1,300,000. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the product is worth more to me, Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation. Accepting now secures a strong return."
