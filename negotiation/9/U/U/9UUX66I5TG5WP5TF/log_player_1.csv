{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to get as close to his valuation as possible without exceeding it, ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Safety Net (John):**  You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, so any offer above that is profitable.

By offering the product at $1,450,000, you leave Bob with a potential profit of $50,000, making it a tempting offer while still securing a significant profit for yourself."
