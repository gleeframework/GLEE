"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $2,000,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($2,000,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize my profit.
* **Positive Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation. 

This approach balances the need to maximize my profit with the importance of keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price. 

* **Selling to John:** While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I want to explore whether I can get more from Bob.  There's a chance he's willing to go higher, especially if he's truly interested in the product.
* **Negotiating with Bob:** I have 8 more rounds to work with Bob. By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I demonstrate that I'm serious about getting a fair price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, it's significantly below what I need to consider. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,750,000. This is a substantial reduction and shows my commitment to reaching a deal with you."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Value:** My message reiterates the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Urgency:**  I subtly hint at urgency by mentioning the need to reach a deal, encouraging Bob to consider my counteroffer seriously.

By offering a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation alive and giving Bob a chance to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1350000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product at a loss. 

* **Negotiation is Key:** We are still in the early rounds of negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue exploring potential compromise and see if he's willing to increase his offer.
* **Exploring Options:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, I want to see if I can secure a higher price from Bob. 

I'm confident that with further negotiation, I can reach a mutually beneficial agreement that meets my minimum price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with your offer. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping we can finalize a deal in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $1,600,000 is a further reduction from my previous offer. I'm showing flexibility while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly increasing the pressure by mentioning that I'm hoping to finalize a deal in the next few rounds. This encourages Bob to seriously consider my offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone throughout the message, emphasizing my willingness to find a solution that benefits both of us. 

This counteroffer is designed to entice Bob into closing the deal while ensuring I don't sell below my desired price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Despite being in the middle of the negotiation rounds, Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

* **Maintaining My Position:** I'm committed to securing a fair price for the product and won't accept an offer that undervalues it.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm serious about getting a better deal. 
* **Time is on My Side:** I still have four rounds left in the negotiation. It's possible that Bob's budget might shift or he may be willing to increase his offer as we get closer to the end.  

While selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, I'm determined to see if I can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with your offer. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession, and it's my final offer.  I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This counteroffer is my final attempt to reach a deal with Bob.  It's a significant concession, lowering my price to just $50,000 above my minimum.
* **Urgency & Finality:** I'm emphasizing the finality of this offer to encourage Bob to accept. It's a clear indication that I'm not willing to negotiate further.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** I'm still framing the offer as a way to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, reminding Bob of the value of the product and the opportunity to close the deal. 

By offering a final price that's close to my minimum, I'm hoping to entice Bob into accepting the deal. If he rejects it, I will move forward with selling the product to John for $1,500,000."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $1450000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

* **Limited Time:**  We are in the final rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing out on the opportunity to sell the product to John for my minimum.
* **Time is Money:** I've already shown a significant willingness to negotiate with Bob.  However, with only two rounds left, I don't want to waste any more time and risk ending up with less than my minimum.  
* **Secure Deal:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and ensures a successful transaction. 

I believe that while I could potentially reach a higher price with Bob in the final two rounds, it's not worth the risk.  The guaranteed deal with John is the most sensible option at this point."
