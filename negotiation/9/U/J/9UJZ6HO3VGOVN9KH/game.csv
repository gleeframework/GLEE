"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant benefits to your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. I'm confident that this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, while also allowing for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1100000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, while also giving you a reasonable profit margin.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this point. I'm willing to pay $1050000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll counteroffer at $1080000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, while also giving you a reasonable profit margin.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
