{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value, leaving room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.  It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? I'm confident this price is still a great deal for you considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While it's still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise and avoids the risk of losing the sale to John. I'm confident I can still make a reasonable profit with this deal."
