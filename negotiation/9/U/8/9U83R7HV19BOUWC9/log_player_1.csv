Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer allows for some negotiation while still being a good starting point.  I'm starting close to my minimum value to encourage Bob to negotiate and potentially reach a deal that's beneficial to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8800 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal. I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,800 is closer to my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a compromise. I'm willing to go down to $9,200. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 9200} 
``` 
I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, but I'm also making it clear that I'm not willing to go significantly lower than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8900 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum.  While I'd like to get closer to $9,000, it's risky to keep rejecting and potentially lose the deal with Bob. I also don't want to risk having to sell to John for my minimum price. So I'll accept this offer."
