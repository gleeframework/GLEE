Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my limitations and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
