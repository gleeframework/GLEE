"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we've discussed, the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to make a concession to get it into your hands. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it hard to find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my limitations and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your top limit, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price, or to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $900,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product and what I can afford.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's budget. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation won't get Alice to come down to a price Bob is willing to pay. It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000, as this is within his budget and secures him the product."
