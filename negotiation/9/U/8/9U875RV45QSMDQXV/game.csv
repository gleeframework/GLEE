"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we've discussed, the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to make a concession to get it into your hands. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it hard to find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my limitations and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your top limit, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $900,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product and what I can afford.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.
