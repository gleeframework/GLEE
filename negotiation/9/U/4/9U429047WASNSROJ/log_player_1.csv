Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn more. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm starting with a price that is reasonable but allows for some potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counter-offering at $130. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profitable sale."
