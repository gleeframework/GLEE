Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  $1,500,000 is a significant markup, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point given the product's value to me."

It's down to the wire.  While $1,050,000 is a decent price, it's not enough to make me feel like I got a great deal, especially considering the time spent negotiating.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  It's my minimum, but at least it's a guaranteed sale, and I don't have to risk further negotiation."
