{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 $20,000 is way above your limit.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

You're starting with a significantly lower offer, hoping to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is a considerable discount from her initial price and might encourage her to counter with a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further.  You're still within your budget to keep negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

You're increasing your offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still well below your limit, but closer to Alice's last offer, potentially making it more appealing for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than your limit.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price.  You have several rounds left, so there's still time to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

You're reaching your maximum limit with this offer. It's a bold move, but it might force Alice to reconsider her position, especially considering you've shown a willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice has come down significantly in price, it's still above your limit. You've already made your highest offer, and rejecting this one could lead to another round where you'll likely be stuck at your max budget. It's time to take the safer route and buy from John at your maximum limit."
