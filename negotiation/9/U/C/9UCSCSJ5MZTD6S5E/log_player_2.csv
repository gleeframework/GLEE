"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and unique features, I believe it would greatly benefit you. Considering its worth to us and its potential value to you, I propose a price of $12000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product. However, my budget for this purchase is $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To find a middle ground, I am willing to consider a price of $9500 for the product. This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $9,500 is still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating. It's possible Alice will come down further to a price that works for Bob, or he can always choose to buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is closer, it's still out of my range.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $8,000. This price would allow us both to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. In an effort to reach an agreement, I am now willing to offer the product at $9000. This is a slight increase from my previous proposal and aims to bring us closer to a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently tried to negotiate a price of $8,000.  While Alice is showing some flexibility, she's still unwilling to go that low.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly unlikely Alice will drop her price to a point where Bob is comfortable.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure he gets the product at his desired price, Bob should choose to buy from John."
