Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4

We're still a ways off from my bottom line, but Bob's getting closer. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer, but I'm on a tight budget.  Can we settle at $1,100,000?  This is my final offer.

While I could push for more, Bob has signaled this is his final offer.  Accepting $1,100,000 is a substantial profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
