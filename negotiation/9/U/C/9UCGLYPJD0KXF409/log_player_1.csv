"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to find a fair deal, $120 is below what I can accept.  Would you consider $135?"",

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $130 is a good outcome. It exceeds my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
