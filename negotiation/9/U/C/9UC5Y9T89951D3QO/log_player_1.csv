"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value of $100. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to earn a profit.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low, even considering his valuation of $80. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum value.  I'm also reiterating the product's value to try and justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $100.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm coming down further, but I'm still making sure the offer is above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer to create some urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close!  I could go up to $78, but that's really pushing it for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $78 is still too low for me. Even though it's getting closer, I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price below my minimum value.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $100, which is a much better outcome."
