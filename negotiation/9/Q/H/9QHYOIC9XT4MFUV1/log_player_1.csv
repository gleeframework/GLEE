"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for the most profit, but also leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  He's willing to pay $1,000,000, so he has room to negotiate down without losing out completely.
* **It sets a clear expectation:** You're not starting with a lowball offer, showing confidence in your product's worth. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product's value, but I would like to propose a price of $820000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and doesn't reflect the product's worth. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob is clearly interested, and you have 8 more rounds to reach a more profitable deal. 
* **Selling to John is not ideal:** It's better to try to negotiate further with Bob, even if it takes more time. 

Let's see if you can get Bob to increase his offer in the next round!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $820,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you. Let's meet in the middle at $880,000. This would be a mutually beneficial deal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 880000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $950,000 to $880,000.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that $880,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing fairness and shared gain. 

Let's see if Bob will accept this counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $860000 would be a fair price for both of us. I hope you consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for improvement:** Bob's offer is closer to your desired price, but there's still potential to get closer to $900,000. 
* **Time is on your side:**  You have 6 rounds left, so there's no need to rush into a deal at this point. 
* **John's offer is lower:**  While John is a backup option, it's still worth pushing for a better deal with Bob.

I'm going to counter Bob's offer in the next round!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer.  However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. Let's aim for a final price of $875,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to make a good profit while you still get a valuable product for a great price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moderate Counter:**  I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but not significantly, demonstrating that I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  I'm re-framing the counteroffer as a compromise, making it seem like a fair solution for both parties.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that $875,000 is still a good deal for him, given the product's value.

Let's see if this offer will be accepted or if we need to keep negotiating!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've carefully considered your last offer and would like to propose $865000 as a fair price for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $865,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $865,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for a better price:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below the $875,000 you offered in the previous round. You can likely negotiate a bit higher.
* **Time is on your side:** You have 4 rounds remaining, so there's no need to settle for a price that's not ideal. 
* **John's offer is lower:** Selling to John would mean a significant loss compared to what you're hoping to get from Bob.

Let's see if we can get Bob to increase his offer again in the next round!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still a bit off from your offer. Let's split the difference at $870,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 870000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and suggests a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Fairness Appeal:** Emphasizes the ""fair"" aspect of the offer, implying a neutral outcome for both sides.
* **Satisfied Outcome:** Highlighting the satisfaction of both parties makes the deal seem more appealing and reinforces the idea of a mutually beneficial solution. 

This offer is a good compromise and could be the tipping point in reaching an agreement. Let's see if Bob is ready to close the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given your proposal careful consideration and am willing to offer $867500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that respects the value of the product while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $867,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $867,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Higher Price:** While Bob's offer is tempting, there's still potential to get closer to your desired $870,000. You've already demonstrated flexibility, and with only two rounds left, it's worth pushing for a slightly better deal.
* **Time is Running Out:** You're entering the final stages of negotiations, so it's important to use this time wisely. 
* **John's Offer is Less Attractive:**  Selling to John is still not ideal, as you'll be leaving significant profit on the table.

Let's see if a final counteroffer in the next round can convince Bob to close the deal at a price closer to your target!"

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's meet in the middle at $868,750. This would be a fair compromise, allowing me to accept a slightly lower price while ensuring you still get a valuable product for a competitive price.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 868750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  Emphasizing that this is your final offer creates a sense of urgency and increases the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:**  Meeting Bob halfway shows a genuine effort to reach an agreement and suggests a willingness to be flexible.
* **Value Proposition:**  Reminding Bob of the value he'll receive for the price helps to justify the offer and make it seem like a good deal.

It's the final round, so let's see if this offer will be enough to close the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've thought about your last proposal and am willing to agree on $868000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that respects the value of the product while also being mindful of my budget. I hope this aligns with your expectations.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $868,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** While Bob's offer is still slightly lower than your desired $870,000, it's very close and represents a good profit.
* **Final Round:** This is the last round of negotiation, and refusing this offer means you'll likely have to sell to John for a much lower price.
* **Time Pressure:**  It's better to secure a deal now than risk losing out completely. 

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a decent profit while minimizing the risk of a worse outcome."
