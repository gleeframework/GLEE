"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. If Bob is truly interested, he'll likely counter with a lower offer. This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $950,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's last offer.  I believe this is a fair price, showing I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is a good deal considering we're already in round 4.  Accepting this offer ensures a significant profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation with Bob or having to sell to John for a lower price."
