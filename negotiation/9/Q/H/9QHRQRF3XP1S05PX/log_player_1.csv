{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, giving Bob room to negotiate but also indicating the value I place on the product.  I'll be ready to adjust my price based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell. I'll counter with a higher offer to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $8,500. This is a good deal for both of us. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, and Bob is getting a slightly discounted price on the product.  I'm happy to move forward with this sale."
