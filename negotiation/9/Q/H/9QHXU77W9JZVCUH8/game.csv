"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,250 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high. How about $9,800? This feels like a fair price for both of us.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,800 is close, but I need to get at least $10,000 for this.  How about we split the difference and call it $9,900?",9900.0,Alice,5,
