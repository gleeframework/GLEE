"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $140, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 seems a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($110), we aim to understand Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation.
* **Respectful Tone:** We want to maintain a positive relationship with Alice, so the message is polite and expresses continued interest in the product.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is below Alice's value ($120) but well below our maximum ($150). This gives us room to potentially meet in the middle if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's still a good deal for you, given the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $125, which is above her value ($120) but still a good deal for us. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might refuse and we'd end up paying more with John. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
