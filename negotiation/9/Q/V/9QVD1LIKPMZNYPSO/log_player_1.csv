{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's very valuable to me. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer allows for a decent profit for Alice while still being attractive to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob decides to counteroffer, but it also protects Alice by being higher than what she would receive from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it is still significantly lower than what Alice could get from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice can get a better price, even if it means a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $9,000 to make this work. How about $8,900? "", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $8,900. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,450. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,450. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,450
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's counteroffer is getting closer, it's still not high enough.  Alice values the product at $10,000 and can sell it to John for that amount. There's no need to continue negotiating with Bob, as the risk of not getting a better offer outweighs the potential gain of a few hundred dollars."
