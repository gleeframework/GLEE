"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,500. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,500 is way above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  There's no reason to even consider the counteroffer stage at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14,500 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than that to me.  I could consider letting it go for $13,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. John offers the product for $10,000, which is within Bob's budget and the best deal available. There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice."
