Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're finding the product valuable, Bob. I've considered your offer carefully, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I propose a price of $7,250 for the product. This is a fair compromise that respects both the value of the product and your budget. I hope this proposal suits you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is offering a price significantly lower than her initial offer. While you could try to negotiate further, you risk:

* **Alice walking away:** She might be firm on this final offer. 
* **Wasting time:** You could spend more rounds getting closer to $7,000, but the time spent might not be worth the small potential savings.

Accepting at $7,250 gets you the product at a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and below your ""walk-away"" price of $8,000."
