Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't undervalue my product.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message indicates that I'm open to discussing the price, making Bob feel like he has leverage.
* **John as a Backup:**  The presence of John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to be firm and not settle for a price significantly lower than my desired value. 
* **Avoiding Counteroffers:**  I am aiming to get Bob to accept my initial offer. If he counters, I'll evaluate his offer and adjust accordingly, but I want to minimize the back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still lower than my desired value:** While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffers are still possible:** I'm willing to engage in further negotiation, and I believe I can potentially get closer to my asking price with another counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $10,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'll try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my original asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $13,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good value for the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my original price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a good deal. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price, hoping to convince Bob to pay more.
* **Keeping the door open:**  My message is friendly and leaves the door open for further negotiation, if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely watch Bob's reaction to this offer. If he rejects it, I'll assess whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John. 
* I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's willingness to negotiate and my confidence in getting a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and consider $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired value:**  $13,000 is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  It's a good compromise.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it:**  While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away altogether, leaving me with John's offer of $10,000. 
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate would take more time and effort, which might not be worth the potential gain of a few hundred dollars.

**Conclusion:**

At this point, accepting Bob's offer of $13,000 seems like the best option. It's a good deal for me, and it minimizes the risk of losing the sale altogether."
