"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000.  I believe it's a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. It's highly unlikely she'll come down to $8,000 immediately, so rejecting this offer and seeing if she counters with a more reasonable price is the best move."
