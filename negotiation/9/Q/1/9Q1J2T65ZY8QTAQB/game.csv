"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price considering the market value of the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the market value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,
