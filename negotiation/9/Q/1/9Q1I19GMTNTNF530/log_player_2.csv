Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value I believe the product holds, and I think it's a good compromise between our initial offers.
