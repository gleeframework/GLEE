{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.  This allows for potential profit while also giving Bob a reason to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, so it's not acceptable.  I'll counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $115? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already countered once, and his response makes it clear he's not willing to meet my price. It's better to sell to John at this point and avoid further negotiation."
