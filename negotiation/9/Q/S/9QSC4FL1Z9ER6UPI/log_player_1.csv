Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize my profit.  However, I'm prepared to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I'll be watching closely to see if his counteroffer indicates he's truly interested and willing to pay a significant amount. If he's not, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I want to see if I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit. I think this counteroffer is reasonable and shows my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  I don't think I can get a better price from Bob, and I don't want to risk further lowering my price and ending up with less than my minimum.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum value, so that's the safer choice."
