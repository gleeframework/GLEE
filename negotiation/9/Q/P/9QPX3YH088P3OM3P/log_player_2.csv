"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $90 is less than what John is offering, it's still above Alice's perceived value of the product ($80). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might incentivize Alice to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal."
