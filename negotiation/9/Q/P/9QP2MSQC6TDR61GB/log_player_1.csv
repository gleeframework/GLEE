Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000 through counteroffers if needed.  

It's important to note that this is a starting point and I am prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's reaction. If Bob rejects this initial offer, I'll be prepared to counter-offer and try to find a price we can both agree on. However, I'm always aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept an offer that's so far below my target. 

I will make a counteroffer in the next round.  I need to find a price that balances my need to earn as much as possible while still keeping the possibility of a deal with Bob alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a fair price for my product.  

This offer allows for further negotiation while also maintaining a strong position. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
