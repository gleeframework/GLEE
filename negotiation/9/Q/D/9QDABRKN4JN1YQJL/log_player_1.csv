Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $135? Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground."", ""product_price"": 135}

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
