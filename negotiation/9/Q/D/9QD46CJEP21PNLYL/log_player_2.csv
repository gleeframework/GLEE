"Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can get the product for less than $800,000 from Alice, so buying from John doesn't make sense.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price from Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $700,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer is lower than the price from John, and it's likely we can't get a significantly better deal by rejecting and counteroffering again.  It's a good price for us."
