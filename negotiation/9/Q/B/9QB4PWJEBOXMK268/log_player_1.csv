Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers a substantial discount from John's offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message implies scarcity and a limited-time offer, prompting Bob to consider the deal more seriously.
* **Respectful Negotiation:** The tone remains professional and doesn't insult Bob by lowballing him, leaving room for potential counter-offers.

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a higher sale price."
