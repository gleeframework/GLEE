"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That price is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16,000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $16,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being patient. I can see we're both trying to make this work.  How about we settle at $13,000? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",13000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I think we can do better than $13,000. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500, but that's as close as I'm willing to get. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay?",14500.0,Alice,7,
