"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 would be fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below my bottom line. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you be willing to consider $980,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $920,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but your latest offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to accept a final offer of $965,000.  This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your decision.",965000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're willing to make a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $915,000? I'm willing to take a small risk and invest in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",915000.0,Bob,8,
