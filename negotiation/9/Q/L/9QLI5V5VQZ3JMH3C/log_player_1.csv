Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below my bottom line. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly away from our minimum acceptable price. We have time and room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you be willing to consider $980,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $920,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I think this price is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is attempting to significantly slow down the price increase. While $920,000 is tempting, we are still significantly below our minimum. We need to push back and signal we're willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but your latest offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to accept a final offer of $965,000.  This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 965000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time to signal firmness and set a hard limit. This offer represents a significant compromise from the original ask, but still keeps the deal profitable. By presenting it as a ""final offer"", we increase the pressure on Bob to commit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to make a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $915,000? I'm willing to take a small risk and invest in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has clearly demonstrated he is unwilling to meet our lowest acceptable price.  We've signaled our firmness, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. It's time to cut our losses and move on to the guaranteed deal with John."
