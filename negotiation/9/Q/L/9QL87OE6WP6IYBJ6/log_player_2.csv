"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great value, and I'm willing to let it go for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within my budget, I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price. There's no harm in trying to get a better deal, especially since I have 10 rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to test the waters. I'm dropping the price by $25, which is a reasonable amount. I'm also being polite and expressing my interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $137.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $137.50, which is within my budget and a good compromise. I'm happy to accept this offer, as I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up paying more if I go to John or Alice counters again."
