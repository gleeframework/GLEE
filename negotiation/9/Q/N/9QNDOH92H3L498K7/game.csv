"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your perspective, $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1300000 to make this worthwhile.  Would you be willing to go to $1350000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1325000?,1325000.0,Bob,4,
