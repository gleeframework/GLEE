Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?,1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $1800000 to me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can you meet me at that price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with $1600000. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to the price I'm looking for. How about $1500000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price, and I think it's a fair reflection of its value to me.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment to purchase the product. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.
