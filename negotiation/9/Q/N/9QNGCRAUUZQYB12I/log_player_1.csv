"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting high, at $17,000, knowing Bob values it at $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but also signals that I'm serious about getting a good price.  I'm hoping he'll counter, but if he rejects outright, I can always go to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,500. This is still above my minimum price, but it's a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob sees this as a good compromise, but I'm also prepared to go back and forth a few more rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price, especially since I have John as a backup option.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500. This is a small drop from my previous offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer. If not, I'm ready to continue negotiating in the following rounds."
