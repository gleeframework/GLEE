"Alice,  $16,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $8,000. It's the maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",8000.0,Bob,4,
