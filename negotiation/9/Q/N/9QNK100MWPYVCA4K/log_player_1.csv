I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still leaving me with a significant profit.  I believe this is a strong opening offer, as it demonstrates my confidence in the value of the product while also leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm countering with $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility. However, it's still well above Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but not give away the product for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm still hoping for a better price, Bob's counteroffers are getting increasingly lower.  To avoid potentially getting stuck in a long negotiation and risking further price reductions, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  This guarantees me a safe profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation with Bob."
