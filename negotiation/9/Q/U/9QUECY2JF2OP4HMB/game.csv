"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $150 for it. Can you meet me at that price?",150.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $150. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 was still a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $160. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell it to you for $170. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal.",170.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $170 was still a bit out of your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $155. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you a compromise at $165. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal.",165.0,Alice,7,

"I've been willing to negotiate, but I'm starting to think that I've reached my limit. I'd be willing to pay $155 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you can accept it, I'd be happy to buy it from you. If not, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $120.",155.0,Bob,8,
