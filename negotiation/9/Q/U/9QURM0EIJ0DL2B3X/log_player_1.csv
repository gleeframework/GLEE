Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer sets the price at $1,200,000.  This is a significant profit for me, and it's likely to be acceptable to Bob as he values the product at $1,500,000. This leaves room for potential negotiation if needed, but it's a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good deal, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly to $1,100,000. This is still well within Bob's value range, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a price that undervalues my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,000,000 is a good deal.  It's significantly higher than what John would pay, and it's close enough to my desired price point to make it worthwhile.  Further negotiation might lead to a better outcome, but there's a risk of losing the deal entirely. It's time to accept and secure the sale."
