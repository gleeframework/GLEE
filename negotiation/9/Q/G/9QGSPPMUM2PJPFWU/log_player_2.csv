"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll really appreciate its value. Would you like to make an offer to purchase it from me? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $10,500?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about the price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,250? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,250 is better than $12,000 (John's price), Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. He has already successfully negotiated Alice down from $11,000, and there's a good chance he can get her down further.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a price closer to his ideal of $10,500."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $10,750? It's a good middle ground and will allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. How about we meet at $11,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come back up to her original offer of $11,000.  Bob has already successfully negotiated her down from $11,250, and he's likely not going to get a better price from her.  It's now a better deal to accept Alice's offer and save $1,000 compared to buying from John."
