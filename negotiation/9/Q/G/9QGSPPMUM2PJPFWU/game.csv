"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $10,500?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concern about the price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,250? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its benefits.",11250.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. How about we meet at $11,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",11000.0,Alice,5,
