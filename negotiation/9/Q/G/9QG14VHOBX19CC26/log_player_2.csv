"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I know you value highly, and I'm confident it would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price that allows me to make a good profit while still giving you a significant discount. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $10,000.  There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she's willing to come down."
