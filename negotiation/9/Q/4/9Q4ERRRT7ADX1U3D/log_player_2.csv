Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your offer of $700,000. However, I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $790,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.

At this point, Alice's offer of $790,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's below your maximum budget and saves you $10,000 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price and could risk losing the deal altogether."
