"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your offer of $700,000. However, I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still a little ways off. Would you consider $760,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $790,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",790000.0,Alice,5,
