I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000.,18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time.  This reflects the maximum value I can see in this product for myself. I'm hoping we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that $8000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, but I have to consider my own minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to lower my price to $14000. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14000 is still too high for me.  I understand you have a target price, and I'm aiming to be fair.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $9000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a reasonable starting point for a deal we can both agree on.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still a long way from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to lower my price to $12500. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. However, $12500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to lower my price to $11500. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,7,
