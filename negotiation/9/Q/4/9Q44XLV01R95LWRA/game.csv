"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However,  $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the value you place on the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and the value you've placed on it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
