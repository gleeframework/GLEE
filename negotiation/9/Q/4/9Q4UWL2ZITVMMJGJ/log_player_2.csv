"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get a good return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a good deal for Alice, it's not a good deal for Bob. He can get the product for $15,000 from John, and it's worth $15,000 to him.  There's no need to accept a higher price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still getting a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $16,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $17,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?

Bob should reject the offer. Even though Alice has come down a bit, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can still get the product for $15,000 from John, so there's no need to accept a higher price at this point."
