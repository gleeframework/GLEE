"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'm willing to put on the product.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This price still leaves you with a good margin while allowing me to get closer to my desired value.  I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,400,000. How about $1,350,000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
