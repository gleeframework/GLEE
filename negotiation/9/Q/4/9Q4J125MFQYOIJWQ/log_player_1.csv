{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price given the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still being attractive to Bob.  If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option to ensure I don't get stuck in a negotiation that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'm willing to put on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This price still leaves you with a good margin while allowing me to get closer to my desired value.  I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,400,000. How about $1,350,000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is getting closer to my minimum.  While I'd prefer more, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower offer or a complete rejection is high.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit, which is preferable to potentially losing out on a deal with Bob altogether.  John's offer is a tempting safety net, but I'm willing to take this risk for a slightly quicker and more secure sale."
