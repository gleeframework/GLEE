{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $100 is above your $80 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $100 is less than Bob's perceived value of $120, giving him an incentive to buy.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can still raise the price if Bob counteroffers. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? That seems like a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $90 is a bit low, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to push for a higher price, $92 is a good deal for me. It's more than John is offering and it's close enough to my desired price. I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
