"Hi Alice,  $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This offer stands as a compromise to ensure a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. How about we settle on $9,500? That would be a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
