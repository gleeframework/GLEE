"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I can't go as low as $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12500? That's still a great price for a product worth $15000 to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this deal happen!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11500 and $11000. How about $11250? That's the best I can do, and I'm really hoping we can make a deal.",11250.0,Bob,6,
