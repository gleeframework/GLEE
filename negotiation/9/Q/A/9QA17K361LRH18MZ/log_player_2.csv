"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  That's a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, we aim to establish a negotiation range that benefits us.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message maintains a courteous tone while clearly expressing our desired price point.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves space for further negotiation and compromise. We expect Alice to likely counter again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $85, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice lowered her price, it's still above our ideal target. We have rounds to spare and can try to negotiate further.
* **Testing Alice's Resolve:** By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about getting a lower price and see if she's willing to move closer to our range. 
* **John's Price as Leverage:**  Having John's offer of $100 gives us a fallback option, so we can be more assertive in our negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $77?  That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 77
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer but Standing Firm:**  We've increased our offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but we're still aiming for a price well below Alice's last offer. 
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Tactic:**  This framing can be persuasive. It suggests a sense of fairness and compromise.
* **Limited Time as Leverage:**  As rounds progress, the pressure increases on Alice to make a deal.  She knows we have the option of going with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle, Bob. I can do $82, but that's as close as I can get to meeting you at $77. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. $82 is a good price compared to our $100 alternative with John.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars in further rounds, it's unlikely to be a significant difference, and we risk Alice walking away.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and gets us the product sooner."
