"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $14,000 right now. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $17,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go down to $15,500?  That would be a great deal for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
