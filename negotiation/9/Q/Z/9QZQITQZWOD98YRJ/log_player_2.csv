{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I'm closer to your offer, $825,000 is still a bit high.

* **John's offer is still a backup:** My backup option with John remains available, allowing me to hold out for a better price."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting very close to a deal. I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $815,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. This is my final offer. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 815000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $815000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $815500. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:** This is Round 9, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation process.
* **Minor difference:** Alice's offer is only $500 lower than my last counteroffer, a very small difference that isn't worth the risk.
* **John's offer is the better deal:** While I can potentially get a lower price by continuing, John's offer is the best deal I've been presented with. 
* **Risk of impasse:**  There's a significant risk that we'll reach an impasse in the final round, leaving me with no product and a wasted negotiation. 

It's better to secure the product from John at a slightly higher price than to risk losing the deal entirely and potentially being stuck with no product."
