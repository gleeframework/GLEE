"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that reflects its potential. I'm asking $950,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the fact that I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,
