"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation but also reflects the value I place on the product. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $9,500 is too low for me, especially considering the value of the product to both of us.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This shows I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm still holding firm on my belief that the product is worth more than Bob's initial counteroffer. Hopefully, this price point is more attractive to Bob while still being beneficial to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $10,500. I believe this is a fair compromise, especially since I'm getting closer to my minimum price and John is also offering $10,000. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this price and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed deal. It's important to be decisive and know when to accept a good offer."
