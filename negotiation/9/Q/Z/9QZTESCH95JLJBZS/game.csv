"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $180 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be interested in buying it for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can do $140, which is a bit more than my minimum, but I think it's still a good deal for you.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $140 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Let's meet in the middle at $120. It's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $120. I can do $130, which is the highest I'm willing to go. It's still a good deal for you, and I think you'll really like the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
