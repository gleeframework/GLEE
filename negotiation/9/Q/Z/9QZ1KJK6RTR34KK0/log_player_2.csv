Round 7

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  While $9,250 is above our ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and still saves us $2,750 compared to buying from John. Continuing to negotiate aggressively risks souring the deal and forcing us to settle for John's higher price."
