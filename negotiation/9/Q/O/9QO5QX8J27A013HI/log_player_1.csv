Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum price of $1,200,000, so you're already in a good position.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  At $1,400,000, Bob still gets a good deal, making it more likely he'll accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counteroffers, you have room to negotiate upwards and potentially secure a price closer to $1,500,000.

However, be prepared to negotiate further.  If Bob rejects your offer, you can adjust your counteroffers based on his responses. Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product looks promising, but your asking price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept for a quick sale, you can potentially get more by continuing the negotiation. 

You can reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to your initial offer. This will show Bob that you are serious about getting a fair price and might encourage him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves you a significant profit margin.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show Bob you're serious:** By rejecting his low offer, you demonstrate that you won't settle for anything below your minimum.
* **Offer a compromise:** $1,300,000 is a reasonable middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  A counteroffer keeps the conversation active and encourages Bob to potentially increase his offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is your minimum acceptable price. While you might have hoped for a higher price, accepting this offer ensures you don't risk losing the deal completely. 

Here's why accepting is the best choice in this scenario:

* **You meet your minimum:** You achieve your goal of earning at least $1,200,000 for the product.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continued negotiation could lead to a stalemate or even a lower price if Bob becomes less interested.
* **Time and effort:** Accepting avoids the time and effort of further negotiations, especially if you're confident this is the best you can get.

You have secured a good price, and it's time to move on to other opportunities."
