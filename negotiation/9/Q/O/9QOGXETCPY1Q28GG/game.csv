"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1300000? This still allows for a significant profit for you, while also being a fair price for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1300000, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $1250000. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1275000.  This represents a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price. While I'm not quite ready to go as low as $1225000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options.",1250000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $1250000. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but no higher. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
