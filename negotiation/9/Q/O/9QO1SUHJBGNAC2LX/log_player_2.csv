Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I acknowledge your perspective on the value,  $1,050,000 is significantly below what I consider fair.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This price allows for a reasonable profit margin for me while remaining attractive to you.
