"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1050000.
