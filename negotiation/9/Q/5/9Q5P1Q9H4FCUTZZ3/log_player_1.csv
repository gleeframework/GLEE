Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might increase if it goes to the public market, justifying the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and uses phrases like ""proposing a price"" and ""What do you think?"" to signal willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged. If Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice can always negotiate down, knowing she has John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $12,000."
