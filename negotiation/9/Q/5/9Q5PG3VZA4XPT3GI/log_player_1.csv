Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $1,300,000.  This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob is clearly very interested and we're reaching a price point that represents a significant profit.  It's better to secure the deal now at $1,350,000 than risk him walking away in further rounds."
