{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation and allows for potential profit. Remember, I'm always willing to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,200 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $13,200 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my ideal target. I've already made a considerable concession, and Bob seems unwilling to budge further. To avoid further negotiation and secure my desired price, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
