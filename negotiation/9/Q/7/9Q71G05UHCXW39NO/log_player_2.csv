"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than you'd be willing to pay, and I'll still be able to make a good profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  Therefore, it's in your best interest to try and negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed with purchasing from John."
