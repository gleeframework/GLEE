"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is less than John's standing offer of $1,500,000.  While there's a chance Bob might increase his offer in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee he'll reach or exceed $1,500,000. It's strategically sound to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
