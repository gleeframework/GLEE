{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value it brings. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation, as it is significantly less than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, but still gives me a profit of $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. It's a fair compromise and still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle at $1,250,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still a good profit for me. It's more than what John is offering, and the negotiations seem to be stalling.  It's time to take the deal and move on."
