Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm starting the price at $16,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 16000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'm willing to push for a higher price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 

This counteroffer shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a price point significantly above my minimum."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Bob is clearly very interested and this price point is a good compromise, getting me $1,500 above my minimum. It's better to take this offer now than risk him walking away in later rounds."
