"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a high-quality item that I believe would be of great value to you. Considering its worth to us and its potential to you, I propose a price of $110 for it. This offer is exclusive to you and I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer ($85 vs. $110). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a substantial discount.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging further discussion.
* **Strategic Positioning:** My ideal price is below $100. By aiming lower, I increase the chances of settling somewhere closer to my target price, even if Alice rejects this initial counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am willing to adjust the price. Considering the value you place on the product, I'd like to offer it to you for $95. I hope this revised price better aligns with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my acceptable price, but I'm still willing to push a bit further. I'm aiming to get the price down to $90 or lower, so I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal.  I'm still below my ""buy from John"" price, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to being able to say yes.  Could you do $90 even? That would seal the deal for me."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Clear:**  I'm being very direct now, stating clearly that $90 is the price I need to see to make the purchase. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By saying ""That would seal the deal,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Alice to accept this offer.
* **Still Negotiating:**  I'm still leaving some room for Alice to potentially counter if she's completely unwilling to go down to $90, but I'm also signaling that I'm close to my limit."
