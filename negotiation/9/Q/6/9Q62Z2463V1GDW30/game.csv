"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which still gives you a good price considering the value you've placed on it. Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $8,000, so I'd like to propose $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
