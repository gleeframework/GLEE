"Alice, that price is way out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is my absolute top offer.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you do $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but I'm still unable to go above $12,000. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $15,000? This would be my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
