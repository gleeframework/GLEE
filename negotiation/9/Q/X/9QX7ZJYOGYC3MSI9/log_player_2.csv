"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it will be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is way above my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's much better to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that price is way out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is my absolute top offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price to show Alice I'm serious about buying, but also to establish a clear lower bound for negotiations. I'm hoping she'll be willing to compromise, but if not, I can always go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you do $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $18,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above my budget. I'm going to reject and try to push her closer to my price point. I have 7 rounds left and can always go with John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but I'm still unable to go above $12,000. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $10,000 to $12,000, showing willingness to compromise.  This keeps me within my budget while also demonstrating that I'm serious about buying.  I'm hoping this offer will encourage Alice to move closer to my target.  If she doesn't, I can still switch to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $15,000? This would be my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above my budget.  While there are still rounds left, I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get her lower than my maximum.  Therefore, it's more efficient and less risky to buy from John at $10,000. I'm getting the product at my desired price and avoiding further negotiation that might not be successful."
