"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $9,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
