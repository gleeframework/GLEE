# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's a good deal, but Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and counteroffer $950,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price and only a little higher than Bob's last counteroffer. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save a substantial amount of money."
