Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $110 is still lower than my minimum price, so I can potentially lower it if Bob is hesitant. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  $110 is a good starting point as I can still sell to John for $120 if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is below my minimum price of $120 and doesn't even meet my initial offer of $110. 
* **Opportunity to counter:** While I could sell to John for $120,  I still have a chance to get a better deal from Bob.  
* **Counteroffer:**  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum price, but still lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's still a great price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a compromise by suggesting $100, which is halfway between my initial offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($90). 
* **Still above minimum:**  $100 is above my minimum price of $120, so I'm still getting a good deal.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to agree, emphasizing the quality of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $100 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $95. It's a fair price for both of us and we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $95 is closer to my minimum price of $120, it's still below it.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer, he might offer even less, making it less likely I'll reach my minimum price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a profit and avoids the potential for further negotiation that might lead to a lower price.

Since I'm getting a guaranteed profit with John, it's more advantageous to sell to him at this point."
