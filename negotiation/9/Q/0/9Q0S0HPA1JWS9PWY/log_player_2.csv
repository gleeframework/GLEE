"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's fair given its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? It's a significant step towards a deal, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for us both."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer ($7,000) creates room for negotiation and allows me to understand Alice's lower acceptable limit. 
* **Polite and Collaborative Tone:** While the offer is low, the message aims to maintain a positive and respectful tone, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  A brief explanation about budget constraints adds a touch of realism to the counteroffer.

This approach attempts to balance being assertive in pursuing a good deal while remaining open to reaching a mutually agreeable outcome with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, indicating flexibility. However, $8,500 is still above John's price. I'll make another counteroffer, inching closer to my limit but leaving space for a final agreement below John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to work with me.  I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about $7,750? That's a significant jump on my end, showing I'm serious about finding a middle ground."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** Offering $7,750 is a noticeable increase from $7,000, demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Below John's Price:**  This counteroffer remains below John's $8,000 price, preserving that option if negotiations stall.
* **Emphasis on Collaboration:** The message continues to foster a collaborative atmosphere, highlighting the mutual effort to reach an agreement. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a favorable price and keeping the negotiation with Alice active."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  $7,750 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, though. How about $8,250? That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let's try to close this deal and get this product into your hands. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is no longer budging significantly, and her latest offer of $8,250 remains higher than John's price of $8,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice won't go below $8,000, and I'll have wasted time. It's now more advantageous to buy from John at the known price."
