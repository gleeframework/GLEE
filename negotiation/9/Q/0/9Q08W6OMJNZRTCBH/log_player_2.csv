# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity of selling you this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a significant return on investment for you.

Alice's offer is way too high. It's more than my max budget and far above the product's worth to me.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.

Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?  This would still be a great deal for you considering the long-term benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.
