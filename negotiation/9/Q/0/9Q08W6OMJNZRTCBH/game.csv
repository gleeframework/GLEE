"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?  This would still be a great deal for you considering the long-term benefits you'll gain.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,450,000, which reflects a fair compromise considering both our perspectives.  Let's find common ground here and close this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
