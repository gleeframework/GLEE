Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your company. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm focusing on the positive aspects of the deal and emphasizing the value the product will bring to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not setting a hardline price, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer and allowing for a potential compromise.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I can quickly pivot to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000. 

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while also considering the possibility of a mutually beneficial deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $900,000 to $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to consider his offer, accepting it would result in a substantial loss.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and can attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  There's still a chance Bob might be willing to compromise, and I have the security of John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $950,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated for the value of my product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price would still provide you with significant savings compared to the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and Justification:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway (between my initial offer and his offer). I also provide a logical reason for my counteroffer by emphasizing the product's value and the savings Bob would still realize.
* **Maintaining My Ground:** I'm not going below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but I'm demonstrating flexibility to keep the negotiation moving. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is clear and direct, stating my counteroffer and the reasoning behind it. 

This approach aims to push Bob closer to my desired price while remaining open to a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand the value of your product, but I must stick to my budget. I am unable to go beyond $1,000,000. I hope this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm not willing to risk losing out on a much better deal with John for a slightly higher offer from Bob.

By choosing to sell to John, I guarantee myself the highest possible price and avoid further negotiation."
