"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $900,000 to $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $950,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated for the value of my product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price would still provide you with significant savings compared to the product's true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
