"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product truly is exceptional, and I'm confident it will bring you significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This price reflects its quality while still offering you a strong return on investment.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and the initial offer you made.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
