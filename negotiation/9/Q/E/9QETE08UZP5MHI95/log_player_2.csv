"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,250,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a substantial discount.  $1,100,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. This also leaves room for further counteroffers if Alice is unwilling to accept this price.  It's a good starting point to test Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $1,100,000.  Bob is still aiming for a lower price and can try to push for a better deal.  It's not yet time to accept or buy from John.  Rejecting and counteroffering again leaves room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a compromise. It's higher than his previous offer, showing flexibility, but still lower than Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates that Bob is serious about negotiating and willing to meet halfway, but also that he is not willing to accept Alice's full asking price.  This should prompt further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than what Bob is aiming for. The negotiation is still within reach of Bob's desired price range. He can continue to try and push for a lower price. There's no need to accept this offer or buy from John yet. Rejecting and counteroffering again might lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's desired price. He's increasing his offer to $1,200,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This is a significant jump from his previous offer, suggesting he's nearing his limit but still hoping to get a slightly better deal. This approach allows him to gauge Alice's willingness to meet him halfway while keeping some leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is now within Bob's budget.  While he would prefer a lower price, continuing to reject and counteroffer risks running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John at a higher price. 

Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product for a price that's significantly lower than John's,  achieving his goal of saving money.  The remaining rounds can be used to finalize the deal and potentially negotiate on other terms."
