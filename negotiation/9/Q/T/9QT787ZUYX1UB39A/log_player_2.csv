# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Considering its value and the fact that it's worth $10000 to you, I propose we make this deal happen for $9500. This is a special offer tailored just for you, and I believe it presents a great opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional without breaking the bank. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is lower than your maximum willingness to pay ($10,000).  It's a good deal for you, even if you could get it from John for $10,000.  You save $500 by accepting Alice's offer."
