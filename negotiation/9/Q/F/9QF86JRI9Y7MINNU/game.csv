"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,800. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget,  $8,800 is significantly lower than my minimum valuation. I'm willing to come down a little bit further to $9,200.  This price still reflects the product's value, but it's closer to your budget. Let me know what you think.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $9,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",8600.0,Bob,4,
