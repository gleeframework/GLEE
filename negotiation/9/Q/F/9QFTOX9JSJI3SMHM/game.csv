"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
