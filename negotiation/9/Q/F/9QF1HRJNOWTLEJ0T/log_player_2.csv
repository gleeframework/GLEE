{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to say if $500,000 is a good deal.  I want to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $300,000 is a substantial reduction from her initial price, and it should give us a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but $400,000 is still too high. I'll try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $350,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a better price.  It's a reasonable compromise that could lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is being stubborn, but I'm still committed to getting a better deal.  I'll keep trying."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly to $400,000. I'm trying to meet Alice halfway, and hopefully she'll see that we're getting close to a deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is back to her original price, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $425,000. This is a reasonable compromise that shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to save some money. We're getting close to a deal, and this offer should be tempting for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not willing to budge on her price. I've offered a reasonable price, but it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement. It's better to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 than to risk getting stuck in further negotiations with Alice.  At least I'm getting the product, even if it's at a higher price."
