"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I think you'll find that this product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, I've already told you that I'm looking to make a profit, and $100 is the minimum I'm willing to accept from you. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'm not going to go any lower. So, I'll stick with my previous counteroffer of $110.",110.0,Alice,5,
