"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its potential benefits.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price.**  There's no immediate benefit to accepting. 
* **You have no information about the product's value to Alice.** This means there's potential to negotiate a lower price.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.** By rejecting, you can explore if Alice is willing to sell for less. 

**Next steps:** You'll need to make a counteroffer to Alice. Since you don't know the product's value to her, a good strategy is to start with a significantly lower offer (e.g., $1,000,000) and see how she responds."

{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know if that's a starting point for us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1000000 is a bit below my expectations, I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1200000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is a price we can work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above your ideal price.** You want to save as much as possible, and $1,200,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **You have no information about Alice's minimum price.**  She might be willing to go lower than $1,200,000.
* **Rejecting keeps the negotiation open.** By rejecting, you can continue exploring if a lower price is possible.

**Next steps:** You'll need to make another counteroffer to Alice. Since she's shown a willingness to negotiate, consider a counteroffer between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000, keeping in mind you're aiming for the lowest possible price."
