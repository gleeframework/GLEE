Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a bit of a compromise, giving Bob a slight discount while still ensuring I get a decent profit. I'm hoping to get a quick sale, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try and counter-offer Bob, hoping to close the gap a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm sticking to my guns a little bit, but I'm also trying to be reasonable. I'm offering $105, which is halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough to Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to go any lower and risk losing money. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120. This will guarantee a profit and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
