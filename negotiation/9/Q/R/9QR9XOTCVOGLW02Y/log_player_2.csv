# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a significant discount from what it's worth to me.  This is a one-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a discount from her perspective, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  You can get the same product from John for a lower price, making it the better choice."
