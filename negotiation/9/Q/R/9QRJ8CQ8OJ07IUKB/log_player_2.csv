"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $13,500?  That's still a good price for you and a great deal for me. "", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price.  How about $13750? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $13,750 is still a good price for Bob, significantly lower than John's $15,000.
* **Negotiation:**  Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk Alice will reject, leading to a higher price or even the need to buy from John.
* **Compromise:** Alice has shown willingness to negotiate, and this offer represents a compromise. 

Accepting Alice's offer balances Bob's desire for a lower price with the risk of losing a good deal and paying more."
