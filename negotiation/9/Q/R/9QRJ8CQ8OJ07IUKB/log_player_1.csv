Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum value of $12,000, and it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. However, it's also lower than the product's value to Bob, giving him an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $13500?  That's still a good price for you and a great deal for me.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I believe I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price.  How about $13,750? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. "", ""product_price"": 13750}
