Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $110. I believe it offers excellent value at this price, especially considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's wise to start with an offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (even if subjective) can make the offer feel more reasonable to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By not starting at my absolute lowest, I give Bob the opportunity to feel involved in the process and potentially meet me somewhere in the middle. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit while remaining aware of my alternative (selling to John for $80).  If Bob:

* **Accepts:** Great! I get a great price.
* **Counters with a price above $80:** I'll likely accept, unless it's significantly lower than my current offer.
* **Counters with a price of $80 or less:** I'll reject and likely counter with an offer slightly above John's price, reinforcing that I have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a decent offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay a reasonable price, but I started high for a reason. 

**Next Step:** I will counter with an offer between $95 and $110, aiming to find a middle ground that still yields a good profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This price reflects the true value of the item."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic aims for a perceived sense of fairness. 
* **Holding Firm:** I'm not dropping my price drastically, signaling that I'm confident in the product's value.
* **Alternative in Mind:** I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's $80 offer."
