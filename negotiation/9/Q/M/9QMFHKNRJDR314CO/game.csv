"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $120.  This is a great product and a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
