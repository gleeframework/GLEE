"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, given its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $1,350,000, he is still saving money compared to buying from John and it's a good price considering Alice's minimum is likely around $1,200,000.  There is no guarantee that further negotiation will get a better price, and it risks losing the deal altogether."
