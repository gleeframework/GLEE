"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a significant profit. However, I'm leaving room for negotiation, as Bob's value for the product is higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still aiming for more. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still maintaining a profit margin. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to accept, but leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price and I'm confident that I won't be able to get a significantly better deal. It's better to accept and secure the profit now rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
