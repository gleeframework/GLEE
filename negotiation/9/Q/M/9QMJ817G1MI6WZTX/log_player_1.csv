"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's above Bob's value but below my minimum. This allows room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum desired price of $12,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe there's still room for a higher offer that's more beneficial to me.  Selling to John immediately would secure my minimum, but I'm hoping to potentially earn more by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth much more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see it in action.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great opportunity to acquire a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm proposing a counteroffer at $9,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price above my minimum. I'm also emphasizing the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $8,000, so I'll offer $9,500. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'm hopeful that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can get closer to my desired price. I have 6 more rounds before I need to make a decision, so there's still time to see if we can reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the value of this product. Let's try $10,500. This gives you a great deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer to $10,500, which is closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum. I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to see the merit in my price. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise and shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to make a reasonable profit, but $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer of $9,500, so I'll offer $10,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, but I need to be careful with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $12,000. I have 4 rounds left, and I believe there's still potential to reach a price that's more favorable to me.  Selling to John right now would secure my minimum, but I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a price that works for both of us.  While $10,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product.  Let's split the difference and settle on $11,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and it will allow me to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm proposing $11,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum. I'm also reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my asking price. With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm aiming to reach a deal that's closer to my desired price while still keeping the negotiations open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer of $10,000, so I'll offer $10,500. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, but I need to be careful with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've reached a critical point in the negotiation. With only two rounds remaining, the offer from Bob at $10,500 is still below my minimum desired price of $12,000. While I've been able to push the price higher through negotiation, it's unlikely I'll be able to reach my desired price in the remaining rounds. It's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's a chance we won't reach an agreement, and I'll be left with nothing. 

To ensure I secure at least my minimum price, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000. This guarantees me a good return on my investment, and it eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob potentially failing."
