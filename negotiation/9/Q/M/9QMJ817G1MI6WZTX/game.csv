"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth much more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see it in action.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great opportunity to acquire a valuable product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $8,000, so I'll offer $9,500. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the value of this product. Let's try $10,500. This gives you a great deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to make a reasonable profit, but $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer of $9,500, so I'll offer $10,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, but I need to be careful with my budget.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a price that works for both of us.  While $10,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product.  Let's split the difference and settle on $11,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and it will allow me to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit.",11000.0,Alice,7,
