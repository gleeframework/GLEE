"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $165. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $165 is still a bit too much. I'm willing to pay $145. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair to both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $165 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $157.50. This is my final counteroffer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",157.5,Alice,5,
