# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am excited to present our flagship product, which I believe could significantly enhance the value and efficiency of your operations.

This price reflects the value we place on the product while allowing us to maintain a reasonable profit margin.

Please consider this offer carefully. Should you have any questions or require more information about the product, feel free to ask. I am here to provide all the necessary details to help you make an informed decision.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for $800,000, saving him $150,000."
