"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price! I'm willing to sell it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $150 for the product.
* Alice is offering it for $125, which is still within your budget. 
* However, you can potentially save money by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you're signaling to her that you might be willing to pay less.  She might counter-offer with a lower price. 

This strategy gives you a chance to get the product for a lower price than $125.  While there's a risk that Alice won't counter-offer, you're still covered by your backup option with John."
