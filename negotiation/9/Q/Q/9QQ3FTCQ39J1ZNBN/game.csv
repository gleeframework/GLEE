"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,000,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the best I can do at this point.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm committed to finding a deal that works for both of us. While I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway,  I'm still hoping to bring the price down to $1,050,000. This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident it would be a valuable acquisition for you.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you're proposing. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,080,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
