"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business.  My research shows that it could be worth upwards of $1 million to the right buyer. I'm confident you understand the potential, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $900,000. This represents a significant value proposition for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,
