"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product at a price that reflects its value. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the opportunity it presents. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is still too low for me. I understand your perspective on the market value, but this product is unique and offers significant benefits that justify a higher price.  I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $1,100,000? This price reflects both the value to you and the fact that I'm willing to be flexible.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market value of similar products. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  How about $1,075,000?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating, Alice. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I propose a price of $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
