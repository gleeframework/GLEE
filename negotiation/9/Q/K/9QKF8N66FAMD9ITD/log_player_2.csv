"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to me, but considering its value to you might be different, I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's aim for something that both of us will find acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $80.  While she mentions being open to a fair price, it's best to start negotiating from a lower point. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product,  $120 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if that's acceptable."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'd like to counter with an offer of $95 for the product. This is higher than your offer but still lower than my personal valuation. I hope this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $95 is still above my budget. While she's moving closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to pay more than $80. I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $80. This is the maximum I can pay, so let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try $90 for the product. It's a bit more than your last offer, but it's still below my valuation. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my maximum budget of $80 and will continue negotiating in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  However, $90 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my offer of $80. This is the maximum I can offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to compromise further. How about $85 for the product? This is still below my personal valuation, but it's a step closer to your offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $85 is closer to my budget, I'm still determined to get the product for my maximum price of $80. I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating. There are still a few rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might agree to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further. However, $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $80. This is the maximum I can pay, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we settle on $82 for the product? It's a bit more than your last offer but still below my personal valuation. I believe this is a fair compromise given our previous discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $82 is very close to my maximum budget, but I'm still hesitant to pay more than $80.  We're down to our final round of negotiation.  

While there's a chance Alice might finally accept my offer, I don't want to risk it. I'm confident I can get the product for $80 from John. It's not worth potentially getting stuck with a slightly higher price when a guaranteed deal is available.  I'll choose to buy the product from John."
