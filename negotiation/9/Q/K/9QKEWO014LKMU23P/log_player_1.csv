Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it at $150, there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price, netting me more profit than selling to John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it just below my minimum acceptable price creates a sense of urgency and makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While I haven't explicitly invited negotiation, starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a profitable price and ensuring I don't lose out on the guaranteed $150 from John."
