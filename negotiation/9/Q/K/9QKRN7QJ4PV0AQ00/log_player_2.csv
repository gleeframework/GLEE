"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset while still leaving room for profit. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000.  This price still allows for a healthy profit margin for you, and it's a much fairer reflection of the product's true value.  What do you say?
