"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'd like to offer $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential benefits to both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, I'm confident in the true worth of this product and its potential to exceed even your expectations.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would still allow you to make a significant profit while helping me stay within my budget. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
