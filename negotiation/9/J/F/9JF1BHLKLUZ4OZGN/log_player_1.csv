{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My Floor:** I won't sell for less than $15,000 because John will buy it at that price.
* **Bob's Ceiling:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so anything above that is a loss for him.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a $7,000 difference between my floor and Bob's ceiling. 
* **Optimal Price:**  $12,000 is a good starting point. It's closer to my floor, giving me a better return, but still within a range Bob might consider.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, I aim to:

* **Maximize Profit:**  I get closer to my desired price.
* **Increase Chance of Acceptance:**  Bob might be tempted by the deal, especially if he sees the value in the product. 

**Important Note:**  This is a strategic starting point.  I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed, but I won't go below $15,000 as John is a guaranteed buyer at that price."
