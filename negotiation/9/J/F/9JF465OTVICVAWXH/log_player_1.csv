Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it has immense value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's potential value to Bob. This might pique his interest and encourage him to consider my offer seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for discussion and potential counteroffers. 

**Important Note:** This is a strategic starting point. The actual negotiation will depend on Bob's response and my assessment of his interest and willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. Would you consider selling the product for $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball Offer:** Bob's offer is at my absolute minimum. Accepting it would mean no profit for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows his interest.  I believe there's room to negotiate a higher price.
* **No Immediate Need:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, but it's not ideal. I want to try and get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe this product has more potential value.  How about we split the difference? Would you consider $1,750,000?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by offering a compromise price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential value to reinforce the justification for a higher price. 
* **Clear and Direct:** The message is clear and concise, directly stating the new price and encouraging a quick response. 

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll finalize the deal. If he rejects, I'll need to assess his sincerity and consider my options:

* **Further Negotiation:** I may make another counteroffer, potentially lowering the price slightly.
* **Selling to John:**  If I'm not confident I can get a better deal with Bob, I'll consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given your proposal some thought. I'm willing to go up to $1600000 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise considering its value. Could we agree on this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress in Negotiation:** Bob has increased his offer from $1,500,000 to $1,600,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Close to Minimum:**  $1,600,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer means a small profit. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  If I reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, there's a chance he might walk away. 

**Conclusion:**

While I would ideally prefer to get a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a worse outcome or a longer process."
