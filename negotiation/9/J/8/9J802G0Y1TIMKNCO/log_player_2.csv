"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. This is the minimum price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $11,300. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. You're now only $300 above your target price of $11,000.  It's likely that you won't be able to get a better price from Alice, and you're risking losing the deal if you continue to reject her offers. It's a good compromise, and you're still saving $900 compared to buying from John."
