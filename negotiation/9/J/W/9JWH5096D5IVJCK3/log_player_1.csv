I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than my minimum, giving me some room to negotiate. I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay this much for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping that this price will be agreeable to him, as it's still higher than what he's willing to pay currently but closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my desired price and much better than selling to John for $8,000. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him."
