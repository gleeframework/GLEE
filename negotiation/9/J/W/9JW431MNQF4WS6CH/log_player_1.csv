Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it's worth more to you than that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, making Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Highlight Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to increase his desire to purchase it.

This strategy allows me to start the negotiation with a strong position while leaving room for potential compromise if necessary.  It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if I need to move closer to his valuation or if there is room to negotiate a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my $15,000 floor. 
* **I have a guaranteed backup buyer.**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I don't need to rush into a deal that leaves me under-compensated. 
* **Negotiation is still possible.**  While I've rejected Bob's offer, I'm open to further discussion.  There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price through counteroffers.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain a stronger negotiating position and keep the door open for potentially finding a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and what it can do for you.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This demonstrates willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to make him see the worth in paying a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm staying positive and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation amicable.

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable level. I'm aiming to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. How about $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $10,500 is only $4,500 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  This is a significant reduction from my original asking price. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** It's possible that further negotiation could get me closer to $15,000. However, there's also a risk of Bob walking away, leaving me with John's $15,000 offer. 
* **Time Consideration:**  Continuing negotiation could drag out the process, and I may not be able to close the deal with John before another buyer comes along.

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my minimum price, $10,500 is a reasonable offer.  I'm accepting it to secure the deal and avoid risking a potential loss by continuing to negotiate."
