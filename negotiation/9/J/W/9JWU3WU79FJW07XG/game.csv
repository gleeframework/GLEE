"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is too low for me.  This product offers significant value, how about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be honest, $11,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. How about we split the difference and call it $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $12,000? I think that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
