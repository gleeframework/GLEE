Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is too low for me.  This product offers significant value, how about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
