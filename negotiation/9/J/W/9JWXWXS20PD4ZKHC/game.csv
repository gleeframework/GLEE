"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I understand your perspective, $1,400,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives you a good deal. What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,450,000. Can you consider this offer?",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,450,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to go down to $1,525,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product at a very competitive price.  Let me know what you think.",1525000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,475,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer?",1475000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get the best deal. While I respect that,  $1,475,000 is unfortunately not where I need to be. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,490,000.  That's a significant concession on my end, and it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.  Let's make this deal happen!",1490000.0,Alice,7,
