"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Reasonable Justification:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, which could make him more receptive to negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message invites Bob to engage in further discussion, rather than simply presenting a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation strong while leaving room for compromise if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping for.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed backup offer from John. I'm going to try to push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I understand your perspective, $1,400,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway.
* **Justification:** I'm justifying my offer based on the value of the product, not just my own needs.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" Bob will get, making it more appealing.

This approach aims to find a middle ground while still remaining firm on my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,450,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I have a guaranteed backup offer from John, so I'm not in a rush to accept a deal that leaves me with less than my target. I'm confident I can still push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,450,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to go down to $1,525,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product at a very competitive price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1525000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Persistence:** I'm demonstrating my commitment to securing a favorable price by continuing to counter-offer.
* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession ($25,000) to show flexibility but still maintain a price above my minimum acceptable level.
* **Reframing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great opportunity"" and ""competitive price"" to make the offer more enticing to Bob.

By continuing to negotiate while making small concessions, I aim to find a middle ground that satisfies both parties and maximizes my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,475,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to keep negotiating but will only accept an offer that meets or exceeds my minimum.  I still have a guaranteed backup offer from John, which gives me the leverage to hold out for a better price.  I believe we can still reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're determined to get the best deal. While I respect that,  $1,475,000 is unfortunately not where I need to be. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,490,000.  That's a significant concession on my end, and it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1490000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm demonstrating my commitment to reaching a deal by making another counteroffer.
* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession ($50,000) to show flexibility, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting we ""make this deal happen!"" to encourage Bob to close the deal.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground with Bob, while keeping in mind that I have a backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,475,000 and $1,490,000, which is $1,482,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,482,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,482,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  With only two rounds left, the chances of Bob significantly increasing his offer are slim.  Since I have a guaranteed backup offer from John, I'm going to sell to John and secure the best possible price.  It's not ideal to walk away from a negotiation, but it's a strategic move to maximize my profit in this situation."
