"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000.  I think it's a fair price that reflects the worth you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  There are more rounds available, so Bob should try to negotiate further to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer than Alice's initial price. This is a good starting point for negotiations, as it signals Bob's willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for compromise. The message also acknowledges Alice's perspective and offers a justification for the counteroffer, potentially increasing the chance of Alice accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $12,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $13,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's preferred price.  He has more rounds to negotiate, so he should try to push for a lower price. There's still a chance he can get closer to his target of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us, and it would let us close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer. This shows Alice that he is serious about purchasing the product but still wants to get the best possible price.  He is aiming to reach a compromise by offering a price slightly closer to his target while still leaving room for further negotiation."
