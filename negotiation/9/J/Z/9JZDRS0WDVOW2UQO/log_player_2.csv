"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a better price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is still a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $8,800 for the product. This is still a good price for me, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's ideal value:** $8,800 is only $800 higher than Bob's target price of $8,000.
* **It's a good compromise:** Alice has lowered her price from $9,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a better price, but it risks running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John at a higher price. 

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price, without risking the possibility of having to pay more later."
