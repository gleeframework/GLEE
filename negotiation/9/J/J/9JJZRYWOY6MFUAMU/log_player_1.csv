Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts, as I believe this is a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you're essentially playing with a safety net. This allows you to aim significantly higher with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** By starting with a high offer of $1,500,000, you emphasize the product's value and potentially anchor Bob's perception of what he should pay. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation. He might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than your guaranteed $1,000,000.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a degree of risk. There's a chance Bob might outright reject the offer without countering. However, the potential reward of securing a much higher price justifies the calculated risk."
