{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$850,000 is a good price, but I can likely get a better deal. I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This will test her willingness to negotiate and potentially lead to a faster deal at a lower price."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $775,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my target. I believe I can negotiate a lower price, so I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm staying below Alice's latest offer, aiming for a price closer to my target."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $765,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $765,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $765,000 is getting closer to my desired price point.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to budge further or I might run out of rounds before reaching a satisfactory agreement.  

Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer while leaving room for potential further negotiation in future rounds if needed."
