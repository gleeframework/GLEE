"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $200. It's definitely worth more than that, but I'm hoping we can strike a deal. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $60 is unfortunately far below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $120 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a final offer of $80, which is the most I'm willing to pay. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",80.0,Bob,4,
