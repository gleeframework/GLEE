"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This allows for room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and positive tone can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I mention the product's value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high, then gradually lower the price if Bob rejects the offer. If he counters, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or counter again. I'll keep an eye on the number of rounds and the possibility of selling to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I'm aiming for.  I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher.

**Strategy:**

* I'm rejecting Bob's offer to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* I'll use the next round to counter with a price that's slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's current offer.  
* I'll monitor the number of rounds and the possibility of selling to John as the negotiation progresses."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $9,000 is still a bit below what I can reasonably accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This price allows me to make a fair profit while still offering you a great deal on the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm countering with a price that's in the middle of our two previous offers. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a higher price.
* **Reiterate Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to emphasize why the price is justified.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive and respectful tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us.  
* This counteroffer allows for more flexibility in the negotiation and may encourage Bob to accept.
* I'll continue to monitor the number of rounds and the possibility of selling to John if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,000, so I'm offering $10,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I would ideally like to get closer to my desired $15,000, accepting this offer ensures I don't lose out on a potential sale.

**Strategy:**

* **Risk Assessment:**  Rejecting this offer increases the risk of further negotiations failing, potentially leading to a lower price or no sale at all.
* **Time Factor:**  We are already in round 4, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or waste valuable time.
* **Financial Gain:** $10,250 is a significant gain for me, considering Bob's initial offer of $9,000.

**Conclusion:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiations. This is a financially sound decision that allows me to make a good profit while maintaining a positive relationship with Bob."
