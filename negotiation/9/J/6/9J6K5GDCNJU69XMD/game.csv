"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $9,000 is still a bit below what I can reasonably accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This price allows me to make a fair profit while still offering you a great deal on the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,000, so I'm offering $10,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,
