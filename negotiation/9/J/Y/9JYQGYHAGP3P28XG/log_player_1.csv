Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $875,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given our mutual interests.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

While $875,000 is a decent offer and closer to my minimum goal, I believe I can still do better. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $887,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to finalize this deal at $880,000.  This would represent a significant saving for me while still providing you with a fair return on your investment. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a bit more, Bob's offer is close to my desired price.  It's important to remember that I only have 10 rounds to close the deal, and I don't want to risk losing out on this opportunity entirely.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get the highest possible profit within the time limit."
