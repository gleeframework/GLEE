"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $950,000. It's a fair deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is less than what John is asking, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above her minimum. It shows Bob is serious about getting a deal but is also trying to push for a better price. 
* **Justified:** Bob emphasizes the value to Alice and his budget constraints to make his counteroffer seem fair. 
* **Open to compromise:**  The message leaves the door open for further negotiation, inviting Alice to make a counter-counteroffer if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the potential gains you'll make. I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, there's still a $50,000 gap.  Bob can potentially secure a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Avoiding a knee-jerk decision:**  Accepting Alice's offer would result in a decent price, but Bob wants to maximize his savings.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and close the remaining gap. 
* **Staying within the budget:**  Bob is still within his budget and has time to negotiate further.  There's no urgency to accept Alice's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $875,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given our mutual interests.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob is moving closer to Alice's offer, showing he is willing to compromise.  The counteroffer is halfway between their last proposals.
* **Strong justification:** Bob highlights the compromise he's already made and emphasizes that his offer is fair considering both their interests. 
* **Urgency without pressure:** Bob expresses a desire to ""make this happen"" but avoids sounding desperate. This creates a sense of urgency without pressuring Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500.  This price reflects a significant compromise from my previous offer and offers a strong return for you. Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the goal:**  Alice's offer is only $12,500 above Bob's last counteroffer.  There's still a chance to save even more by continuing negotiations.
* **Time is on Bob's side:**  With several rounds left, Bob has the luxury of trying to squeeze out a few more dollars without risking losing the deal altogether.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting the offer keeps Bob in a position of strength, showing Alice that he's not willing to settle for a price that's too high."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $887,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to finalize this deal at $880,000.
