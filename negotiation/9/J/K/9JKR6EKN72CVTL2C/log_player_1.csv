Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with my target price of $1,200,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. It's a bold move, but if Bob rejects it, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,100,000. It's a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing while still ensuring I get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal, or at least push him closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm countering with $1,050,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and within the range of a potential compromise. I'm hoping this offer demonstrates that I'm serious about selling to him, but that I'm also not willing to settle for a price that is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, it's getting increasingly clear that we're not going to reach a deal. I'm not willing to go much lower than $1,050,000, and Bob seems unwilling to budge on his $980,000 offer.  John's offer guarantees me my desired profit, so it's the best option at this point."
