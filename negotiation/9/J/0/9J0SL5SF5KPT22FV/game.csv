"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you is $1,000,000 and my minimum selling price is $800,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
