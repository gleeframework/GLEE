"I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit off from where I need to be.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's finalize this deal!",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,425,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",1425000.0,Bob,6,
