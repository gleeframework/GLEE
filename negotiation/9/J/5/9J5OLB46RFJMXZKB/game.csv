"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a valuable asset that I believe could be a game-changer for your business.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1500000 to me, and I'm prepared to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential.  Would you be interested in discussing a price of $2000000?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1400000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This price still reflects the value I see in this opportunity, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1700000 is still above my target budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this price is more in line with my expectations, and I'm willing to move forward with the purchase if we can agree on this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
