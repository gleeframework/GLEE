Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value and potential of this opportunity.  I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with an offer significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Building Value:** My message emphasizes the potential value and profitability of the product for Bob. This is intended to pique his interest and make him consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive, but I'm also making it clear that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to negotiate. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just a starting point. The best strategy will depend on Bob's reactions and how much you are willing to risk.
*  I'm keeping John's offer in the back of my mind as a safety net.  If negotiations with Bob fall through, I have a guaranteed buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1200000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Risk:**  Accepting his offer means I get my minimum goal and avoid the risk of further negotiation or the possibility of him walking away.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I might be able to get a higher price with further negotiation, it's not worth the potential risk of losing the deal entirely. 

**Reasoning:**  In this situation, it's better to be pragmatic. I have a guaranteed alternative buyer in John, but there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from Bob."
