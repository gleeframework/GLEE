Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible, but you also want to incentivize Bob to buy.
* **Above Bob's Value:** Offering it at $120 or less guarantees you lose potential profit.
* **Below John's Offer:**  Offering it slightly below John's $150 offer gives Bob a perceived deal and encourages him to buy now. 

By starting at $140, you leave room to potentially negotiate down slightly if Bob hesitates, but still ensure a good profit margin."
