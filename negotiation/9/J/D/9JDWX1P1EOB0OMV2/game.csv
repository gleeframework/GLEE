"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. While the product sounds impressive, I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $22,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While I appreciate the discount, I'm still not comfortable paying $19,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
