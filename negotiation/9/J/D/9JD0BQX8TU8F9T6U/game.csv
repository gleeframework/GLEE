"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $11000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to consider a price of $13500. It's a compromise between our previous offers, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on the profit I need. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $13200. It's a bit above your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,5,
