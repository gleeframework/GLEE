"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $95 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm open to $110. This is a great deal for you considering the value of this product, and it's closer to what I need.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $100, which is my final offer. It's a fair price considering I could buy it from another seller right now for that amount.",100.0,Bob,6,
