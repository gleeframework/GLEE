"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product at a price of $1150000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above your maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but unfortunately, $1050000 is still a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground. I'm open to selling for $1100000. This would still give you a good deal, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your target price of $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1075000 is still not enough for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1087500? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a good deal while ensuring I can make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,087,500 is still above your budget, and it's unclear how much more she might be willing to compromise. Given the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to accept that offer and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
