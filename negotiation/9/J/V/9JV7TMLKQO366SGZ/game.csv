"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $1000000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1050000?  This would allow us to both benefit from the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but unfortunately, $1050000 is still a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground. I'm open to selling for $1100000. This would still give you a good deal, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1075000? This would give us both a good deal while still staying within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1075000 is still not enough for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1087500? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a good deal while ensuring I can make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
