"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer to purchase it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should aim to get the price closer to his $12,000 maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $10,500?  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,250 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point.  Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, so there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to explore a lower price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,250 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $10,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to make a decent profit. How about we meet at $11,375? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he's willing to go up to $12,000. While $11,375 is a better price than John's offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point. By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to explore a lower price point and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to profit, but $11,375 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11,250, but I'll throw in a small bonus that's not included in the price. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to her minimum, but Bob is also getting closer to his maximum.  $11,250 is still above Bob's target price, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept a further counteroffer.  Given the limited rounds remaining (only 3 rounds left), it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  Buying from John for $12,000 ensures a purchase and limits the potential for further negotiation that could lead to an unsuccessful outcome."
