"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  I think this is a fair price given its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $11,500. He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $10,000.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  That's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is within Bob's budget and represents a good deal for him.  Buying from Alice for $11,000 saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John. While there's always room for further negotiation, this offer is a good compromise and a reasonable price for both parties."
