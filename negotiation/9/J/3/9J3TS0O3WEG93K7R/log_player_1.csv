Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can't go higher than $8000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$8,000 is too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17000 is still out of my range.  How about we meet in the middle at $12500?  I'm serious about buying this, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $12500. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've been trying to negotiate with Bob, but it seems he's unwilling to go higher than $12,500.  This is below my minimum of $15,000.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
