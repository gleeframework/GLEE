"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $20000. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can't go higher than $8000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a significant price reduction, and I hope we can reach a mutually agreeable compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17000 is still out of my range.  How about we meet in the middle at $12500?  I'm serious about buying this, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $12500. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal now.",12500.0,Bob,6,
