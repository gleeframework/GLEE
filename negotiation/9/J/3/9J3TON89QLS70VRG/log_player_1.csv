Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, Bob values it at $1,200,000. This presents an opportunity to sell higher.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal (saving $50,000) while also ensuring a significant profit for Alice (earning $150,000 over her minimum). 
* **Confident Approach:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer, increasing the perceived worth and Bob's likelihood of accepting."
