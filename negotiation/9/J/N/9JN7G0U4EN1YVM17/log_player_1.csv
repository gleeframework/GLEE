Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1800000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to make sure it's a good investment for my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $1,800,000 is too low, considering my minimum value is $1,500,000 and I have 8 rounds left.  I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm starting to get concerned about time,  $1,700,000 is still too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my last offer to keep the negotiations moving."
