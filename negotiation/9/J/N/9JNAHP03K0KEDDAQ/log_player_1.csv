"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $15,000. This allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $12,000.  I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get more.  I believe the product is worth more than $12,000, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility but still leaving some room for profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $12,500.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal and  more than my minimum. It's also getting late in the negotiation process, and there's always the risk that Bob will walk away entirely or I'll be forced to accept John's offer.  $12,500 is a solid profit, and I'm comfortable closing the deal."
