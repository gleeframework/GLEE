"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit high. How about we start at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land somewhere around $750,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to make a slight concession. My revised offer is $800,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm open to further discussion.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we settle this right now at $775,000?  This offer represents a fair deal for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial deal, but I'm not ready to accept $775,000 just yet. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make another concession. My revised offer is $795,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to stand firm on this offer.",795000.0,Alice,7,
