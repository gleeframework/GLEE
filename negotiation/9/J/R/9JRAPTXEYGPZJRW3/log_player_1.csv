Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but we also want to avoid Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $140 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also represents a significant discount, making it more enticing for Bob to accept. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 provides a safety net.  We won't go below $150 because we'd lose money."
