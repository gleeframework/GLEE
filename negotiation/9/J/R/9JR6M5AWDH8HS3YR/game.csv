,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $10,500 is still below what I need to sell. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $10,750. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
