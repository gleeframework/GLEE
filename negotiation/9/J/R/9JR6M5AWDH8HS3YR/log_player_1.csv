{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still lower than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary, but also allows you to potentially close the deal at a price that's more favorable to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell it at such a low price, so I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range. I'm not willing to sell it below $11,000 yet. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $10,500 is still below what I need to sell. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $10,750. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $10,750 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $10,250 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is still below my desired price range. While I could continue to negotiate, the process is taking longer than anticipated, and I risk losing even more time. John is guaranteed to buy the product for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. It's more efficient and less risky to sell to John at this point."
