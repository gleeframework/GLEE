"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well. Let's close this deal!",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down again, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000 again, but I think we can find a better middle ground. How about we meet at $9,100? I'm willing to compromise and make a deal if you're willing to come down a bit further.",9100.0,Bob,6,
