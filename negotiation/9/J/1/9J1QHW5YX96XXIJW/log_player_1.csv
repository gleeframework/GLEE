Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $12,000 to me, so accepting Bob's offer of $8,500 would be a huge loss.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down again, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000 again, but I think we can find a better middle ground. How about we meet at $9,100? I'm willing to compromise and make a deal if you're willing to come down a bit further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,100. Although it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
