"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
