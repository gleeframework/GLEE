"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $13,000 is fair. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $13,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you won't regret this investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we settle at $9,500?  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value you've highlighted.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  While I'm motivated to sell, I need to be fair to myself as well. Let's split the difference - $10,250, and we have a deal.  This is a final offer.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $10,250 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $9,750. This is my final offer, I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",9750.0,Bob,6,
