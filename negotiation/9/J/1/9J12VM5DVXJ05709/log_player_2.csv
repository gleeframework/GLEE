"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's strategic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Not Insultingly Low:** While I want to save money, I also want to avoid insulting Alice with an unreasonably low offer. $700,000 is still a respectable amount and demonstrates my willingness to engage in a meaningful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $700,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but it's still too high.  We need to keep negotiating to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $875,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Progress:** Alice came down in her counteroffer, showing she's willing to negotiate.  I'm going to increase my offer slightly to show I'm also willing to move, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  $750,000  is roughly halfway between our last two offers. It signals I'm looking for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're getting closer to the halfway point in the negotiation. I want to try and settle on a price soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $750,000 doesn't reflect that.  To move things forward, I could accept $825,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Bluff:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by stating this is her ""final offer."" This doesn't necessarily mean it's true, and there might be room for her to move a little more. 
* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While $825,000 is getting closer to an acceptable price, it's still above my target. I'm willing to take a calculated risk and see if I can get her down a bit further. 
* **Backup Plan:** I still have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000.  This gives me leverage, knowing I won't be forced into accepting a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand this product means a lot to you, Alice, and I respect your final offer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000?  That's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Calling the Bluff (Slightly):**  By offering to split the difference, I'm acknowledging Alice's ""final offer"" while still pushing for a slightly better deal. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal but need her to meet me halfway.
* **Hitting Her Value:**  Offering $800,000 is significant because it's the exact value the product is worth to Alice.  This might be enticing enough for her to accept, even though she's stated her previous offer was final.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only a few rounds left, I need to increase the pace of the negotiation.  This offer provides a strong chance of acceptance while keeping me below my absolute limit."
