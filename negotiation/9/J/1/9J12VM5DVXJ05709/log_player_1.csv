"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $875,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

We're still too far from Bob's perceived value. Let's push him a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $750,000 doesn't reflect that.  To move things forward, I could accept $825,000. This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand this product means a lot to you, Alice, and I respect your final offer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000?  That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

This is a good outcome for you. While you could push for more, Bob has met your minimum acceptable price and you have a guaranteed sale. There's always a risk Bob walks away if you push further."
