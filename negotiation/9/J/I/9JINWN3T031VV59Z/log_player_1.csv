I'm starting with an offer of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $10,000 to both of us. It gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also ensures I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000 right now.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $10,500. This is still a profit for me and hopefully will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm not sure we'll be able to reach an agreement quickly. I don't want to risk a long negotiation and potentially lose out on a guaranteed sale."
