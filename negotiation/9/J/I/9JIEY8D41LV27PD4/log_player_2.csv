"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. It's worth $100 to you, so it's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no need to pay $95. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice or simply buy it from John for less."
