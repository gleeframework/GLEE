"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its potential value to me.  I'm confident we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product extends far beyond its immediate application for you.  It represents a unique opportunity with long-term benefits. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This reflects a significant adjustment while recognizing the true value of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my comfort zone. Let's aim for a more realistic price. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This shows my serious interest while still being within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a solution. I'm willing to come down further, but $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider.  To meet you closer to your offer, I propose a price of $1,650,000. This represents a substantial concession on my end while acknowledging the value this product brings.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This demonstrates my continued interest in the product, but we need to find a compromise that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I respect your willingness to negotiate. I'm prepared to make my final offer -  $1,425,000. This is a significant compromise on my initial asking price and reflects my desire to see this deal through. Let me know your decision.",1425000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $1,425,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is my absolute final offer.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
