"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $200 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100. There's no reason to accept this offer. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price or switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $100. This is a bold move, but Alice knows the product is worth less to me than it is to her.  She might be willing to come down a bit to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $180 is still above my maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate. I'm hoping to get the price down to $100 or close to it before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $120. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still not willing to go above my limit. It's a compromise that could potentially lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer. I'm not ready to accept yet, as I still have some room to negotiate and potentially get the price down to $100. I'm also considering the potential of John selling out of the product before I get there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $130.  This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on my budget. With only 4 rounds left, I need to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and we're running out of time.  With only three rounds left, the chances of getting her down to my desired price are slim. It's time to switch to John and guarantee a purchase at my budget limit."
