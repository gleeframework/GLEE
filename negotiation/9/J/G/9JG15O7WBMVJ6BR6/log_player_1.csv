"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a quick deal, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm trying to find a compromise by dropping the price a bit, but still keeping it closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $90 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

I'm trying to push Bob towards my desired price by making a slightly more aggressive counteroffer. I'm offering a midpoint between our current positions, hoping he'll see it as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $87.50 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87.5 is a higher offer from Bob, it's still significantly below my minimum price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push him closer to my price. Time is getting short, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but I can't go any lower than $90. This is a fair price, and it's the best I can do.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and get it done."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm sticking to my guns and making a final counteroffer. I'm still within the realm of what's acceptable for me, but I'm pushing Bob to the limit. If he doesn't take this offer, I'm ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to stick to your price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, it's becoming clear that Bob isn't going to budge on his price. I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a deal that's below my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $120.  It's a guaranteed profit, and it's a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
