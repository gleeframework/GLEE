"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $150 from John. Alice's offer of $140 is still too high, and you have room to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting allows you to attempt a lower counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $130, which is still above Alice's value of $120, but significantly lower than her initial offer. This gives Alice some incentive to accept while still saving me some money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $145 is higher than my initial counteroffer of $130.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's likely Alice won't budge much further. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $150, as it's a sure thing and only $5 more than Alice's offer."
