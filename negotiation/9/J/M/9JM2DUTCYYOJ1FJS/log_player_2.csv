"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is asking for $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting allows for counteroffers.** By rejecting, you can try to get a better price without losing the opportunity altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's see if we can make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a compromise, it's still above your ideal price point and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Continuing to negotiate could get a better deal.** There's still a significant difference between Alice's offer and your desired price. 
* **Time is on your side.** You have 7 rounds left, which is enough time to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925000 and $900000, which is $912500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's closer to your desired price, it's still more than you're willing to pay right now.  
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  You have 5 rounds left and can likely get Alice down further. 
* **Waiting can get you a better price.**  You're not under any immediate pressure, so waiting and potentially getting a lower offer from Alice is a better strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $912,500 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $880,000. This reflects a fair price for the product while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 880000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you at $900000 again, but this is my final offer on that price. If you're willing to meet me at $900000, I'll sell it to you today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** While it's not your ideal price, it's within the $1,200,000 limit you set for yourself.
* **There's a risk of losing the deal.** Alice is making this her final offer, and if you reject, you risk her walking away.
* **Time is running out.** You only have 3 rounds left.  If you reject and Alice walks away, you'll have to buy from John at a much higher price. 

It's a calculated risk, but accepting Alice's offer at $900,000 is the most sensible option at this stage. You're still saving $300,000 compared to buying from John."
