Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, making it a potentially attractive offer for Bob.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob while leaving room for negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  A $1,000,000 sale is still very profitable for me, but it leaves room for further negotiation with Bob if he's willing to pay more.
* **Avoid Immediate Rejection:** Starting with a significant discount is more likely to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than immediately rejecting the offer.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I have room to adjust my price in future counteroffers. 
* **Plan B:**  I can always sell to John for my minimum value if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I am willing to offer $950000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still below my desired price point. I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Higher Price:** There's a good chance I can get Bob to increase his offer. He's already shown interest and is willing to negotiate.
* **Minimizing Loss:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially earn a higher price. 
* **John as a Backup:** If I don't manage to get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000.

**Next Steps:** I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's getting closer to what I'm looking for, I'm hoping to find a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $980,000. This would still give you a great deal while ensuring I'm fairly compensated for my investment. Let's see if we can bridge this gap and finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  My counteroffer of $980,000 is a compromise. It's closer to Bob's offer, but it's still a good amount for me and represents a fair value for the product.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and acknowledges Bob's offer while emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Agreement:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, signaling my willingness to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This offer still allows for further discussion if Bob wants to haggle further. 
* **Avoiding a Stall:**  I don't want to drag the negotiations out too long, so I'm offering a price that is relatively close to his offer. 
* **Backup Option:**  Remember, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiations fail."
