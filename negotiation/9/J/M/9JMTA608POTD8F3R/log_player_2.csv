"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to our $10,000 target.  We'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counter-offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us bargaining room. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it shows we're serious about a lower price point.  We need to be mindful that we have the $10,000 option with John if negotiations stall."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price that still allows you to get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice moved closer to our desired price, which is a good sign. However, $10,500 is still above our ideal price and what John is offering. We'll keep negotiating, but we're getting close to the point where buying from John makes more sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit. Would you consider $9,750? That's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 9750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're inching closer to Alice's price to signal we're serious but staying under our $10,000 limit. There's a chance Alice might take this offer since it's closer to her desired profit margin. However, we need to be prepared to walk away if she remains firm on a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This price is fair, and it lets us both get a good deal. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,250.  While we could try to negotiate further, we're now at a point where the potential savings are very small compared to John's offer of $10,000.  It's time to cut our losses and buy from John to guarantee we get the product at our target price."
