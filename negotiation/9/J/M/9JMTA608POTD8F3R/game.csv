"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price that still allows you to get a great deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit. Would you consider $9,750? That's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This price is fair, and it lets us both get a good deal. Let's close this deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
