"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $18000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $15000. Can you consider that?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $15000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to come up to $13000, but that's truly my limit.  Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $14000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work this out.  $14000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $13500. This is really my final offer - I can't go any higher.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but I need to make a profit, so I'm not going to go any lower than that. Can you reconsider?",14000.0,Alice,7,
