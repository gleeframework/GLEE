"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800000. Let me know if you're interested!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $850000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $875000. This reflects the value I place on the product and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it. Let's bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but $880000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $860000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This demonstrates my continued interest in the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this price.",860000.0,Bob,6,
