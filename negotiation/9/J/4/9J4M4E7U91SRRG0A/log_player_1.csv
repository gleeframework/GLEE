"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

This is a relatively high offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible without risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good price. This offer is closer to Bob's counteroffer, increasing the likelihood of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough call, but given the dwindling rounds and the fact that Bob's offer is only $500 less than what John is offering, I think it's a good idea to accept Bob's offer. This ensures a sale and a decent profit."
