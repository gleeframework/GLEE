"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Can we meet in the middle at $825000?",825000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $825000 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, which would be $862500. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",862500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $825000, but I'm not sure I can stretch to $862500. Can we try to meet in the middle again, or perhaps a bit lower? How about $812500?",812500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with the $812500 price point. I'm willing to make another concession and meet you halfway between $825000 and $862500. This would bring the price down to $843750. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",843750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $812500 and $843750, which would bring the price down to $828125. I think this is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Can we agree on this price?",828125.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with the $828125 price point. I'm willing to make another concession and meet you halfway between $843750 and $828125. This would bring the price down to $836375.

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $828125 and $836375, which would bring the price down to $832250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price. If not, I may need to consider purchasing the product from another seller.",832250.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with the $832250 price point.

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point of diminishing returns. I'm willing to make one final offer of $825000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from another seller.",825000.0,Bob,10,
