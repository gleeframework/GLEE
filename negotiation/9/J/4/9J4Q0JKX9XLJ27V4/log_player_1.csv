Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $135. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While we know Bob values the product at $120, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) gives you room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $135 allows for some back-and-forth. Bob might try to negotiate down, and you can potentially meet in the middle. 
* **Considering the alternative:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150. This means you shouldn't go below that price with Bob."
