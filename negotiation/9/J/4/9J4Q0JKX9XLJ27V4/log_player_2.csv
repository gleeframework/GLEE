# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $135. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Alice's Offer:** $135
* **Your Maximum:** $120
* **John's Offer:** $120

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $15 less from John.  You should reject Alice's offer and buy from John to maximize your savings."
