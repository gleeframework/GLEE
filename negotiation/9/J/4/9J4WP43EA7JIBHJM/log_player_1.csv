Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob of its worth, justifying the higher price.
* **Alternative Option:**  Subtly implying you have other options (""before I list it publicly"") creates a sense of urgency and competition. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You know your minimum price ($15,000) and have a backup buyer (John), giving you a strong position."
