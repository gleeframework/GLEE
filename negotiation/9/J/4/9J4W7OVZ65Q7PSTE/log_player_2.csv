"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and would be a great addition to your collection. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $9,500 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will find a good home with me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to get closer to my asking price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his initial budget of $10,000 and closer to his desired price point. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice raising the price further outweighs the potential savings of a few hundred dollars. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
