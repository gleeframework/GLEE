"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget. Let me know if that works for you.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. I'm willing to come down to $16,500. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. What do you say?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,750.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allow us to reach a deal.",15750.0,Bob,4,
