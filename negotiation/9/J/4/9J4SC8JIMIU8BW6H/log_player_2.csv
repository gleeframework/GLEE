"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. I'm willing to come down to $16,500. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  While it's a step in the right direction, Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He's still within his round limit and there's a chance Alice might come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,750.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allow us to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 15750}
