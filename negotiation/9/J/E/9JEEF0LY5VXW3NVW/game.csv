"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While that's closer to what I had in mind, could you do $775,000? That would make this deal very attractive.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $775,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,
