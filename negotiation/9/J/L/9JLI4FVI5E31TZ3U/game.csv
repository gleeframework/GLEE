"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $9,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $9,500, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're open to that.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds, I'm thinking of a price of $10,800. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10800.0,Alice,5,
