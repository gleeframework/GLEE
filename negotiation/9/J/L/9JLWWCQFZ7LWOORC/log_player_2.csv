# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Buying from Alice for $140 is cheaper than buying from John for $150.
* **You still save money:** You value the product at $150, and buying it for $140 means you save $10."
