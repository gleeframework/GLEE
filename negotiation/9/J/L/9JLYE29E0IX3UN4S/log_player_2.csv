"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer is above his maximum price. He should reject and try to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit above my budget. How about $110? I'm really hoping to get this product, and I think this price is fair considering its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $110 doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  I'm really hoping to work with you on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While Bob can still try to negotiate further, Alice's counteroffer is close to his maximum price and the risk of further negotiation failing and needing to buy from John for $120 is high.  Accepting is the best option here to ensure he gets the product while still saving some money."
