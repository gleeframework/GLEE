Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your starting price is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product but I can't go above $1,200,000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,800,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,200,000. If you're not willing to go that low, I might need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is holding firm at his valuation, and we're still far apart. It's unlikely he'll dramatically increase his offer.  We need to signal that walking away is a real possibility to encourage him to negotiate more seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I also need to be mindful of the product's value. I'm willing to consider a significant price reduction, but only if it leads to a deal. My final offer is $1,600,000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other opportunities, including selling to John."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** By presenting this as a ""final offer,"" we increase the pressure on Bob to take it seriously. 
* **Justification:** We're not just dropping the price; we're emphasizing that it's a significant concession to get the deal done.
* **Alternative:** We explicitly mention John to remind Bob we have other options if he's not willing to move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,600,000, but that's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable:** $1,400,000 is a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could push for more, there's a risk Bob will walk away. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids further negotiation and allows us to move on to other opportunities."
