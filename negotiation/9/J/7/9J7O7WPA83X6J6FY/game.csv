"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13750? This way, we both get a fair deal.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13375. Can you consider that?",13375.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $13375 is closer to what I'm hoping for, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  How about we compromise at $13500? It's a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
