"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from the value it holds to me, and it's a great deal for you considering the value you see in it. I understand this is a big decision, but I believe this price point is mutually beneficial. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
