"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  While I agree the product is unique, $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?  I feel that's a fair offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $10,500? It's a compromise that should work for both of us, and it's still a great price for the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
