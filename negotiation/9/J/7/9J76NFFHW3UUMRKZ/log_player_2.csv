Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table.

It's time to cut bait. Alice is very unlikely to go below $10,000 and we have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It's better to secure the product now than risk Alice not budging further."
