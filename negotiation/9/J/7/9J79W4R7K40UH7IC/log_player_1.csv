Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for a potential counteroffer from Bob. This allows me to maximize my potential profit while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is a decent offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about we meet in the middle at $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $11,000,  $9,500 is a reasonable offer and I'm confident that I can still make a decent profit. Accepting this offer avoids further negotiation and the risk of Bob walking away entirely, or me having to sell to John for a lower price."
