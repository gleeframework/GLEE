"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $950,000 is still a bit below my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This takes into account your budget and still allows me to make a fair profit. I'm confident this product will bring you significant value, so let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
