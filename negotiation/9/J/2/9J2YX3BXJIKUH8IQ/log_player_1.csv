"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to what I value the product at, while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$6,000 is far too low for me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a price that reflects the value of the product to me.  I hope this will be enticing enough for Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to risk it and see if I can get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $11,000. This is a substantial decrease from my last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering Bob's previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm starting to feel like the negotiation is going to be drawn out. At this point, it's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000. I'll avoid further risk and still get a decent price for the product."
