"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with an ambitious offer of $1,800,000, significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential,"" I'm framing the product as a premium offering, justifying the high initial price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains positive and open, indicating my willingness to engage in a constructive negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a substantial sum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm not willing to accept a price that's $400,000 below my initial ask in just the second round. I'll counter with a figure closer to my target, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,400,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher, especially considering its long-term potential.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,600,000?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging & Anchoring:** I start by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer to show I'm engaging in good faith. However, I reinforce that I value the product higher.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial concession of $200,000 from my initial ask, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  Proposing $1,600,000 positions the negotiation at the midpoint between our two offers, encouraging a potential agreement. 
* **Future Value:**  I'm again highlighting the product's ""long-term potential"" to justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now willing to meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This is a significant profit above my minimum selling price of $1,200,000. While I could potentially push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob could walk away or that further negotiation could become protracted.  Accepting this offer represents a strong return and a successful conclusion to the negotiation."
