Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $16,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is sticking close to her initial price and has labeled her current offer as ""final"".  It's unlikely she'll go much lower.  Since you can get the product for $15,000 from John, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice."
