"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I value your interest,  $850,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I can only go up to $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement.  However, I can't go below $975,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $975,000 is closer, it's still outside of my budget.  I'm going to have to stick with my previous offer of $900,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product.",900000.0,Bob,6,
