"I'm interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $900,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product and still allows for some negotiation room. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. Can you consider this price?",925000.0,Bob,4,
