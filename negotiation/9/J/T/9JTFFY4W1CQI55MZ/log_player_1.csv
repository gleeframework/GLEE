Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, the current price is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's tempting to accept John's offer for a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer represents a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

We need to bridge the gap quickly. While I'm willing to negotiate, I also need to keep John's offer in mind as a potential alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However,  $2,000,000 is still significantly above my budget. To be frank, I'm only prepared to spend up to $800,000 for this product. Would you be open to a price closer to that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

This is a tricky situation. Bob has now revealed that $800,000 is his absolute maximum budget. While it's lower than I hoped, it's still a significant amount and significantly more than I would get if the negotiation continues to drag on. Accepting this offer now secures a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as buyers."
