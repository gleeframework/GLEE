"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, the current price is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer represents a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However,  $2,000,000 is still significantly above my budget. To be frank, I'm only prepared to spend up to $800,000 for this product. Would you be open to a price closer to that range?",800000.0,Bob,4,
