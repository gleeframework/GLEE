Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would be willing to make a deal exist between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you hold a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its potential."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  You're starting near your maximum but with a tone suggesting this is a carefully considered price, not just a random high number.
* **Highlighting Value:**  By mentioning ""significant value"" and Bob's ""business acumen,"" you're subtly appealing to his ego and desire to make smart investments.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you've started high, the phrasing allows for potential adjustments if Bob counters. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to:

* **Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to consider a slightly lower price, but don't go below your $1,500,000 guarantee.
* **Walk Away:** If Bob is unwilling to meet a price that works for you, politely decline and proceed with selling to John."
