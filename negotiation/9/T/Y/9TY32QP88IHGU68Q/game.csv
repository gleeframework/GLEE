,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Would you be willing to pay $140 for the product?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $120.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to try to meet you at a price that works for you. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to go up to $130. Can you meet me there?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product and I'm willing to go up to $125. This would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad to hear you're serious about the product. I'm willing to meet you at $127.50, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",127.5,Alice,7,
