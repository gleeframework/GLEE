"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the product's worth. ",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product has value, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be willing to start the conversation at $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  That said, $1,100,000 is quite a gap from my initial ask.  This product offers significant value, and I need to see that reflected in the price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product offers value and you need to see a fair price. To be frank, $1,700,000 is still too high for me. Could we consider a price closer to $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need you to meet me closer to my price. Would you consider $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  $1,550,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit rich for me. How about we split the difference and call it a deal at $1,425,000?",1425000.0,Bob,6,
