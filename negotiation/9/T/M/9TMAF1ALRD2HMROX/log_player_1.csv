Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the product is worth $100 to Alice, starting at $120 allows for Bob to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a deal if Alice needs to come down in price. 
* **Awareness of Alternatives:** Alice knows she has John as a backup buyer, giving her leverage to walk away if Bob's offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Alice's minimum, she still has some negotiating room. Bob's offer, phrased as ""meeting halfway,"" suggests he's willing to move up from $90. Alice should counter-offer to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the quality of this product is truly worth it. How about we settle at $105? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Alice is signaling a willingness to negotiate by coming down in price, but not drastically.  $105 is a compromise between her initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Highlighting Value:** Reminding Bob about the product's quality reinforces its value and justifies a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room:**  While closer to her minimum, Alice is still leaving some room for further negotiation if Bob counters. She can always come down slightly or hold firm at $105 depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $95 is only $5 less than Alice's guaranteed sale to John. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better result.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort. Accepting the $95 offer secures a good price without further hassle. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a chance Bob could walk away if Alice pushes for more, leaving her to sell to John anyway. Accepting the $95 minimizes this risk."
