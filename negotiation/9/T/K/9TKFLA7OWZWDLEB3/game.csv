"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is still not fully reflected in your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit steep.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 fully reflects the product's value to you. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,110,000. This is very close to your last offer, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1110000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to let go of the product at $1,110,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,120,000. This is as close to your offer as I can get without sacrificing my own profit margins.
