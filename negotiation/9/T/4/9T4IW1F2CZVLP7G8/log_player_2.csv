It's better to reject Alice's offer and start negotiating. You can potentially save $200,000 by getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

This counteroffer sets the price at your maximum, ensuring you don't overspend. If Alice accepts, you get the product at your target price. If she rejects, you can reassess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiating with her or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

It's still worth continuing to negotiate with Alice.  While $1,150,000 is closer to your ideal price, there's still room to potentially save more.  You can counteroffer again and see if you can get closer to your target price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's price but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows that you're serious about buying the product but are still aiming for a price that's good for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise.  It's closer to your target price of $1,000,000, and while it's not ideal, it saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. Continuing to negotiate could potentially save you a few more dollars, but there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and you risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting her offer is the most practical choice."
