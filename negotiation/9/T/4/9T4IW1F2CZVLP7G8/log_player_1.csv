Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering Bob the maximum amount he's willing to pay.  This maximizes my chances of getting a quick deal and avoids a drawn-out negotiation. However, I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't accept.  I'll then turn to John and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to get a better deal without losing Bob entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a firm stance on my minimum value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While he's moving in the right direction, $1,050,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a new offer hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a further reduction from my previous offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I believe this offer is fair and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement with Bob."
