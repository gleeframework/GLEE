# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for significant negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and the potential for a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still too high for my desired price range. I am trying to save as much money as possible and still have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer again and potentially get a better deal."

This price is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and keeps us both within our respective budgets. I believe this is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $980,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and her current offer is within my acceptable price range. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it. Accepting this offer saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
