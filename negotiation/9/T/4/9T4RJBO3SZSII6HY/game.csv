"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price is fair considering the value you place on it and my desired price range. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still outside of my ideal range. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This price is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and keeps us both within our respective budgets. I believe this is a good deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $980,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",980000.0,Alice,5,
