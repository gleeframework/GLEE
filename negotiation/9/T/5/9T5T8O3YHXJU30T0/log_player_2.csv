"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Could we try something like $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing some real interest from other buyers, and I need to be fair to them too.  To make this work, I'd need at least $110 for the product.  Does that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $110.  While you *might* be able to negotiate her down a bit more, it's getting risky. John offers a guaranteed price of $100, which is a better deal than what Alice is currently offering."
