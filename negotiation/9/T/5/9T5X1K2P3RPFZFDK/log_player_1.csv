Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that's still attractive to Bob (as it's well below his perceived value) while giving me a good profit margin.
* **Sense of Urgency (Implied):**  The message doesn't explicitly pressure Bob, but the slightly discounted price implies it's a limited-time opportunity. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation.  In a real-world scenario, I might start higher and allow for counter-offers from Bob."
