Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $11,500 is less than the product's worth to Bob ($12,000), giving him incentive to buy.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You have some wiggle room to adjust the price if Bob counteroffers. 

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $10,000 if you don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can find a price that benefits both of us further. How about $10000 for the product? This aligns better with its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation,  remember your goal is to maximize your earnings.  You can do better than $10,000.  

Let's make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This price still gives you a significant discount while allowing me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:**  You're not accepting his low offer, but you're showing willingness to compromise.
* **Is still below your ideal price:** You're leaving room for further negotiation, in case Bob still wants to bargain.
* **Shows you're serious about finding a deal:**  This counteroffer indicates that you're willing to work with Bob, but you also have clear boundaries."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, how about we settle at $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer of $10,000, so it's a better outcome for you.  It's also likely that Bob won't go any higher, so accepting his offer secures a sale."
