"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential interest in it. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $825,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while still allowing me to save some money.  What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to save even more, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,050. This is a very slight increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",825050.0,Alice,5,
