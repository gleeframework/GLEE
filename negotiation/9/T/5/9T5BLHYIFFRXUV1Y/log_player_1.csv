Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'm prepared to counter with a lower price, but I'll always keep in mind that John is willing to pay $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is a better price than my initial offer, I believe I can still get closer to my goal of $100.  I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, hoping to meet in the middle.  I'm confident I can get a price closer to my desired $100, but I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is getting closer to his value of $80.  However,  I am not comfortable dropping below $100, and I'm confident that John will pay me that amount.  It's time to move on and secure a sale."
