{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm confident in the value of the product. I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than my minimum desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price range.  I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is a fair compromise.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,250, which would be $8,875. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,875 is very close to my minimum desired price of $8,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to $9,000, the negotiation has been going on for a while and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of selling to John for a lower amount."
