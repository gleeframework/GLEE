Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, Alice. I'd be willing to go up to $1,700,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me at this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate.  Let's see if Bob is willing to move closer to our desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to see a price that reflects the value this product offers. Would you consider $1,775,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."",

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not sure I can go up to $1,775,000. How about we meet at $1,725,000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's a bit closer to my initial target. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we're now at a price that's significantly higher than John's offer. Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer later."
