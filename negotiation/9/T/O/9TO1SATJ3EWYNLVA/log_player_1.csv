Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's far less than the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 
I'm counter-offering at $120.  This is a compromise,  and it's still more than what John is offering. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower and lower, and it's still far less than what I want. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push him higher.  It's starting to feel risky, but I'm not ready to give up just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $100. This is still a decent profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and come up a bit."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round. I'm starting to run out of time, but I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $95. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it's enough to entice Bob to close the deal.  If he rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $92.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting very close.  With only two rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John for a lower price."
