Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might encourage him to consider a higher price. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm open to counteroffers, but I have a backup buyer (John) who will pay my minimum price. This gives me leverage. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Leverage:** I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum. This gives me leverage to push for a higher price.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between his offer and my initial offer. I'll aim to find a price that's both appealing to Bob and profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and makes it more likely Bob will accept.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum price, and I have John as a backup buyer, so I have room to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price for the product.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his next offer and decide whether to accept, counter, or go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the original price you mentioned was $15,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John at my minimum. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and I'm already getting a decent price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
