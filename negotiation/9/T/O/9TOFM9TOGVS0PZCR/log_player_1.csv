Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's an opportunity to earn more. Bob values the product at $8,000, so offering it slightly below your guaranteed price might entice him.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with $11,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob directly is faster than waiting for John, even if the profit is slightly less.

This offer balances securing a good profit with a high chance of Bob accepting."
