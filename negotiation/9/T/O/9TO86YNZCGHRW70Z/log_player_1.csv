Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $115. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $100.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate if he wants to, increasing the chances of a deal.
* **It's a clear starting point:** The message makes it clear you're serious about selling but not desperate. 

If Bob rejects, you can adjust your price based on his counteroffer and how much you want to secure a deal. If you feel like the negotiations are going nowhere, you always have the option to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While selling to John for $100 is a safe option, I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  Since he's willing to pay $120, there's still some room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer will give me the chance to counter with a price closer to my desired $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $105?  It's a fair price that's still within your range but allows me to make a bit more."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm proposing a compromise that's closer to my desired price of $115 while still being within Bob's range.  This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, increasing the chances of a successful deal."
