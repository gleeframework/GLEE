Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident you'll find this price to be fair. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a starting point. Here's the reasoning behind it:

* **High Starting Point:**  A high initial offer creates room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Optimistic Language:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to negotiate, creating a more positive and collaborative tone.

**Remember:** This is just the first step.  You'll need to carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750000 for this product. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential value. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than your minimum acceptable value.** You've stated the product is worth no less than $800,000 to you.  Accepting Bob's offer would be a loss.
* **You have a guaranteed alternative.** Selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  While Bob's offer is low, his message indicates a willingness to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate, but it's still above your minimum acceptable value.
* **Middle Ground:**  $850,000 is halfway between your previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($750,000). This demonstrates a willingness to be flexible. 
* **Value Justification:** The message reinforces the value of the product, reminding Bob why this price is justified.
* **Collaborative Tone:** The language emphasizes working together to find a solution, encouraging a positive interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference and aim for $800000. This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Value:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is your minimum acceptable value, meaning you won't lose money on the deal. 
* **No Further Negotiation:**  There's no reason to continue negotiating. You've reached your minimum price, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at your minimum price, ensuring you get a good outcome.

In this scenario, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice.  You avoid any further negotiation and achieve your goal of selling the product at a price that meets your minimum requirements."
