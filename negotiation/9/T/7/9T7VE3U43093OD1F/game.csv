"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my target price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're looking for a lower price point. While $10,000 is a significant drop, I'm willing to move down to $12,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move down to $12,000. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000, which would be $11,000. Can you consider this offer?",11000.0,Bob,4,
