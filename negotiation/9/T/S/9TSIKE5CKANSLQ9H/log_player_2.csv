"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $10,000 from John.  You should aim to get the product for less than $10,000.  While $9,000 is a good deal, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to sell the product for $8,000, so a counteroffer of $8,500 is a reasonable starting point. It's a good compromise between your target price and Alice's bottom line. This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing you to save money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has countered with $9,200, which is still less than John's price of $10,000. While you might prefer to try and negotiate a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and you risk losing the deal to John. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product for a price within your budget, and saves you the time and effort of further negotiation."
