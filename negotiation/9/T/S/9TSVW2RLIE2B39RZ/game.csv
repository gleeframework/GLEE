"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,800 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? This still leaves you with a decent profit margin and allows me to get closer to my target.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
