"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think it's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $700,000 is below my minimum value. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $850,000?  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue working towards a deal.  $750,000 is still a bit too low, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $800,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction.",800000.0,Alice,5,
