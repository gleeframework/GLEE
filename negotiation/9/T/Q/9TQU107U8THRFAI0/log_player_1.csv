{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and opens the possibility of a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Value Proposition:**  While I don't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, the message subtly implies it's something worth having.

**Next Steps:**

*  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his response. 
*  If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a sale.
*  If the negotiation stalls or becomes unproductive, I'll consider selling to John for $120 to guarantee a minimum profit."
