"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, I'm aiming for a price closer to $950000.  This aligns with my budget and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1050000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1050000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still hoping we can find a price closer to $1000000.  Let's try $1025000.  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to close this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1075000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My revised offer is $1075000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
