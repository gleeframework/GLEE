"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation while staying well below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me. Could you do $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still quite a ways from a price I'm happy with.  It's time to inch up my offer a bit but signal I'm willing to walk away if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a good product Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Could you meet me in the middle at $8,000? That's about as high as I can go."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counter-offer does a few things:
* **Splits the Difference:** Shows a willingness to negotiate by meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and my previous counter.
* **Sets a Firm Limit:** The phrase ""as high as I can go"" signals to Alice this is likely my final offer.
* **Keeps John as Leverage:** While I'm offering her price, I haven't accepted yet.  If she pushes back, I still have the option of going with John."
