You should reject Alice's offer. You're willing to pay $12,000, so there's room to negotiate a better price with Alice.  You can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to your desired price, you can likely still negotiate a lower price.  It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target of $12,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

At this point, it's likely that further negotiation with Alice will only lead to a small reduction in price.  You're already within a reasonable range of your desired price, and it's not worth risking a breakdown in negotiations for a small potential saving.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your target price."
