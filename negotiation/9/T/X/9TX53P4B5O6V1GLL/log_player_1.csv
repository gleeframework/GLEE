"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that's 50% higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's closer to Bob's value.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I want to make a deal, $60 is significantly below my minimum.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to $120.  This is still above my minimum, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good deal and be more willing to come up with a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm getting a little nervous about the number of rounds left, I'm going to hold out for a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $110.  This is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping Bob will come up a little more.  We're getting down to the wire here, so I need to find a balance between being firm and getting the deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below the $100 I could get from John. I'm going to hold out for another round and see if Bob is willing to come up.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm taking a big risk here, but I'm going to go all-in on one last counteroffer. I'm dropping my price to $105, just above my minimum. This is my last chance to get a better deal from Bob. If he rejects it, I'll have to sell to John for $100. Fingers crossed!"
