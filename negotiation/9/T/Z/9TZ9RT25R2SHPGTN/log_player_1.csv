Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product is worth the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Phrases like ""proposing a price"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal to Bob that Alice is open to discussing the price.
* **Alternative Option:** While not explicitly stated, mentioning listing the product ""publicly"" subtly reminds Bob that he might lose the opportunity if he doesn't engage.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
