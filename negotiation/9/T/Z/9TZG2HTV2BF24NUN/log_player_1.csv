Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation but signals that I'm confident in the product's worth.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** Offering $14,000 gives Bob room to negotiate without me feeling like I'm giving away too much. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message keeps the conversation positive and encourages Bob to engage in a back-and-forth. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't pay more than $12,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $12,000 is my absolute minimum, and accepting would mean no profit.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob's offer demonstrates he's interested and willing to pay close to my minimum. This means there's potential for a counteroffer that would be more profitable.
* **No Need to Rush:**  Since John is willing to buy for $12,000, I have no immediate pressure to sell. I can take the time to negotiate with Bob and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is simply too low. How about $13,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $13,000 is still above my minimum, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the benefits of the deal for both of us, which can help encourage Bob to accept.
* **Open to Further Discussion:**  The message doesn't close the door to further negotiation, suggesting that I'm open to discussing other options if Bob is still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I still feel that $12,000 would be a fair price for the product. Could we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $12,500 is above my minimum of $12,000, meaning I'll make a profit.
* **Little Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's offer is close to my minimum. It's unlikely I can get a significantly higher price through further negotiation.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing the negotiation could take time, and with John waiting in the wings, I risk losing a sure sale. Accepting now ensures a quick and profitable outcome."
