"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $15,000 for it. Could we meet in the middle?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product. While $15,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet halfway between our offers at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. I'm still not able to meet at $17,500. I think $16,000 would be the highest I could go.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $16,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. How about we split the difference and settle at $16,500?  This would be my final offer.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, $16,500 is still too high for me. I think $16,000 is a fair price, but if you're unable to meet at that, I would consider purchasing the product from John for $10,000.",16000.0,Bob,6,
