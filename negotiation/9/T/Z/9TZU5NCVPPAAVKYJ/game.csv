"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that's worth a significant amount to you. I understand it has a value of $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This gives you a substantial profit, while also allowing me to achieve a good return on my investment. Consider this a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
