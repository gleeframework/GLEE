Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. I believe it's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$150:** This is a starting price that is higher than my minimum value but not too high to be immediately rejected. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and conveys confidence in the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  The price is high enough to understand if Bob is genuinely interested.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Having a higher starting price allows for potential counteroffers and a more dynamic negotiation process. 
* **Secure a better price:** If Bob accepts, I get a good deal. If he rejects, I can use the information to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your confidence in the product, $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'm only able to offer $80. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting his offer would result in a loss for me. It's important to stick to my bottom line and try to negotiate a better price. 

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I can make a counteroffer to hopefully reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100 to make this work.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100:**  This counteroffer is still above my minimum value but is a compromise to show I am willing to negotiate. 
* **Message:**  The message acknowledges Bob's offer while reaffirming my value of the product. It also emphasizes the fairness of the counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain my bottom line:** $100 is still a profitable sale for me. 
* **Show flexibility:**  By offering a lower price than my initial offer, I demonstrate a willingness to compromise.
* **Encourage further negotiation:** This counteroffer provides a starting point for a more productive exchange."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate you coming down, $100 is still a little outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $80.  It's the absolute most I can afford at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has stubbornly stuck to his $80 offer, which is far below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Continuing to negotiate with him would likely be a waste of time and energy. 

I've reached a point where I'm better off selling the product to John for $120. This ensures I get a decent profit and saves me from potentially going through more rounds of unproductive negotiations with Bob."
