"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to him, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000. This is a fair price considering my value for the product and your potential profit. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my desired price.  How about $1,050,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's target:**  While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,050,000 is still $50,000 over Bob's maximum.
* **Negotiation space:** There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get closer to his target by rejecting and making another counteroffer.
* **Jhon's offer:**  Bob can always buy from John for $1,000,000, but there's still a chance he can get a better deal from Alice if he continues negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing me to get the product and you to make a profit. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value for it and my need to make a decent profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at Bob's maximum:** Alice has finally offered $1,000,000, which is Bob's maximum acceptable price.
* **No further negotiation gains:**  There's no real incentive to continue negotiating. Even if Bob rejects the offer and makes a counteroffer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and further negotiation could lead to a breakdown in the deal.
* **Equal value:**  Both Bob and Alice are getting a fair deal. Bob gets the product at his maximum price, and Alice gets her desired profit.

By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product at the best possible price without risking losing the deal."
