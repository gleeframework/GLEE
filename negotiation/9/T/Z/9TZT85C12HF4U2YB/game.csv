"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000. This is a fair price considering my value for the product and your potential profit. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my desired price.  How about $1,050,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good outcome.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing me to get the product and you to make a profit. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value for it and my need to make a decent profit.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
