Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $99 leaves a slight possibility that Bob might negotiate up, getting you closer to your ideal price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** A price just below $100 makes it seem like a good deal compared to your alternative buyer. 

While Bob might reject this offer, it's the best way to maximize your potential earnings before accepting the guaranteed $100 from John."
