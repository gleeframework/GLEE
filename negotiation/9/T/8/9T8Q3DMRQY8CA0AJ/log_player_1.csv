Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $10,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still potentially settle on a price higher than $8,000.
* **Justifying the Price:** The message subtly hints at the product's value, potentially making Bob more amenable to a higher price.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. You could experiment with different starting prices and observe Bob's responses to optimize your earnings further."
