Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her value for the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

Alice is coming down, but we're still closer to her value ($8,000) than our maximum ($15,000). It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $10,000."

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is a reasonable compromise. It's a good deal compared to John's offer."
