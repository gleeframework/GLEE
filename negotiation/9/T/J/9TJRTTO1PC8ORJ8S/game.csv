"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. Considering your offer of $650,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for working with me. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I still think that price is a bit high. How about we try $725,000? ",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. Considering the product's value to you and my original asking price, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
