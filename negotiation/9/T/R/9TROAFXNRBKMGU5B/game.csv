"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product is worth a lot more based on its features and market value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I really need to stay within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
