"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is willing to sell for $80.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer of $95 keeps the possibility of a better deal open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

A counteroffer of $90 is a good starting point. It's lower than Alice's initial offer, showing you're serious about negotiating, but it's still above Alice's minimum selling price, making it a reasonable proposition."
