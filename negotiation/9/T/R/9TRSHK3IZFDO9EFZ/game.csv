"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value you're offering, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $17,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $16,500. This is a fair compromise for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still leaves you with a profit. Let's finalize this deal.",16500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $16,750. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",16750.0,Alice,5,
