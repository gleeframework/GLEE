"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you made a counteroffer. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
