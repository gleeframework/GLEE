"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the range where Alice could potentially profit. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you made a counteroffer. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a step down from her initial price, it's still higher than my ideal price point. I'm willing to negotiate further.  There's still room to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer. It's still a significant saving for Bob, and it's closer to Alice's minimum price, potentially leading to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,250,000, which is still within my budget. While I'd prefer a lower price, it's getting closer to my ideal range.  This seems like a reasonable deal, and it's better than buying from John for $1,500,000.  It's time to accept the offer and move on."
