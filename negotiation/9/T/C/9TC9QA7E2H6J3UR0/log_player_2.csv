"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $120 for the product, there's no immediate reason to accept Alice's offer. There's a chance you might be able to get it for less by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  How about we try $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $100 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is within my budget and represents a good compromise. It's better than her initial offer of $120, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from further negotiation. While John offers the product for $120, there's no guarantee that Alice won't accept my counteroffer. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a lower price than John's."
