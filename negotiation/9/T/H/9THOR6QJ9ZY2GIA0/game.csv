"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $140?  ",140.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $160, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great product, and I think you'll really like it!",160.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go all the way to $155, Bob, but I can meet you in the middle at $162.50. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for this great product.",162.5,Alice,5,
