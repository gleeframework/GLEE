"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while offering you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
