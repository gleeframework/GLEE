Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its true value."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below your minimum ($12,000).
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It's unlikely he'll accept immediately, but it gives you a chance to gauge his interest.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer at $12,000 provides a strong safety net. If Bob refuses, you haven't lost anything.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations beyond his perceived value of the product."
