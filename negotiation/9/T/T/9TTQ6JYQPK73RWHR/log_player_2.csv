"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is way too high! It's important to make it clear that you won't accept an unreasonable price. Proceeding to a counter-offer is the best approach."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay something closer to $60.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and Thankful:**  It acknowledges Alice's offer and maintains a positive tone.
* **Firm but Realistic:**  The counter-offer of $60 is significantly lower than Alice's offer, demonstrating that the initial price is unacceptable. However, it's not so low as to be insulting (like offering $10), leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Opens Dialogue:**  The message encourages Alice to respond and hopefully propose a counter-offer of her own."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer has come down considerably, it's still above your ideal budget and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting and making another counter-offer is the best move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we try to meet closer to the middle ground?  Would you be willing to do it for $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

Here's why this counter-offer makes sense:

* **Acknowledges Progress:**  Recognizing that Alice has lowered her price helps to maintain a positive negotiating environment.
* **Compromise:**  Offering $75 shows a willingness to move closer to Alice's price while still staying within a reasonable range of your budget and John's alternative offer.
* **Clear and Direct:**  The language is straightforward, clearly stating your desired price and avoiding any ambiguity."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still think the product is worth more than $75. I'm willing to meet you at $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  At this point, $90 is too close to your maximum budget and John's offer of $80.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John to ensure you get the product at the best possible price."
