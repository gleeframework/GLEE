"Bob, I understand your perspective, and appreciate you being open to negotiating. While $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from the deal.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. Let's split the difference one more time.  I'm willing to accept $925,000 for the product. This price acknowledges your commitment to the deal and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the outcome. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $900,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,6,
