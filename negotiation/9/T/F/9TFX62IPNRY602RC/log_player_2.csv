"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $140 is close to my limit, but there might be room for her to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation and gauge her flexibility.
* **Polite and Positive:** I want to maintain a good rapport with Alice to encourage a deal.
* **Expressing Interest:**  I'm showing Alice that I'm genuinely interested in the product, which might make her more willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $125 is a fair price, saving me $25 compared to John's offer and $15 from Alice's initial offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice compromised, showing she's willing to negotiate. Accepting shows I'm also willing to be reasonable. 
* **Avoid Risk:**  Further haggling might make Alice retract her offer, and I risk ending up with John's less appealing deal."
