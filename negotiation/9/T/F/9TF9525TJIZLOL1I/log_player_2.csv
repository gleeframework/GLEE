# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase our product. It's a truly unique and valuable item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price.  Since you have another option to buy the product from John for the same price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with John, or potentially find another seller in the future."
