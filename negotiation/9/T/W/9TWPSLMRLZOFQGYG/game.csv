"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer it to you for $10,500. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
