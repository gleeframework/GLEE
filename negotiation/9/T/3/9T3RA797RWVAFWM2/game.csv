"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1400000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1700000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product. I think it's still a great deal, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my budget. How about $1550000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1550000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $1600000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really want to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",1600000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1700000. I'm willing to meet you at $1675000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1675000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1675000 is still too high for me. I'm afraid I've reached my maximum budget, and I won't be able to go any higher. I'll have to consider other options. I'm going to have to pass on this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,10,
