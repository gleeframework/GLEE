"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
