# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  While Alice's offer is higher than Alice's own valuation, it is still significantly lower than John's price. 
* **It's in Bob's best interest to save money.** Even though Bob could potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice, the goal is to save money.  Accepting Alice's offer achieves this."
