Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise from my initial offer and still allows me to get a better price than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer of $85 is too low for me. I'd rather sell the product to John for $100 and avoid further negotiation."
