"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be highly valuable to your business. I'm confident it can generate significant returns.  My starting price is $1,000,000.  This allows for a healthy margin for both of us. Let's discuss and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $650,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still leaves a good amount of profit for both of us.  Let's try to bridge the gap and get this deal done.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  I could do $725,000.  That would make this a feasible purchase for me. What do you say?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $812,500. That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward. Let me know if you're on board.",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $812,500 is getting closer, but I need to stay within my budget.  Could we settle on $765,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",765000.0,Bob,6,
