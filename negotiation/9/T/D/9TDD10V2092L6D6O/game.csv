"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and still leaves room for you to make a profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential profit you can make. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",980000.0,Bob,6,
