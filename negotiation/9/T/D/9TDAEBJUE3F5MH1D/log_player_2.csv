You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

You can do better than $110. It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?

Alice's offer of $100 is a good deal. It's within your budget, and you're saving $20 compared to buying from John."
