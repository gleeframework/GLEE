"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $850,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd need to see a price closer to $750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $750,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $820,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident that this price still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $820,000 is still slightly out of my range. I'm very interested in the product and believe we can reach an agreement. I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for it. This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",800000.0,Bob,4,
