Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $850,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd need to see a price closer to $750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
