Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair price:** It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It reflects Bob's potential value:**  It's below the $15,000 value Bob places on the product, giving him a reason to consider the offer. 
* **It creates a starting point:**  It allows for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

Let me know what happens!  I'm ready to adjust the offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept such a low price. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  I'm confident this product will be worth it to you in the long run."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

This counteroffer is:

* **Fair:** It's a middle ground between your minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Motivating:** It shows you're willing to negotiate but still value the product.
* **Open to further discussion:** It leaves room for Bob to counter again if needed."
