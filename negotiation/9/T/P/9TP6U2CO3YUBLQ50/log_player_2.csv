"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a lower price, getting closer to Alice's value of $12,000.  We have room to negotiate before hitting John's price of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming low to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards towards a price that works for both of us. 
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message is polite but clearly indicates our budget constraints. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $11,000, we're positioning ourselves closer to Alice's perceived value of $12,000 while still leaving space for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  I'm confident this product will be worth it to you in the long run. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  $12,500 is a reasonable compromise, saving us $1,500 off her first offer and $2,500 off John's price.
* **Limited Upside:** Pushing further might alienate Alice, and there's no guarantee she'll go much lower.  We risk getting stuck in a stalemate and losing the deal. 
* **Meeting Needs:** This price point likely meets both our needs â€“ Alice gets a fair price above her value, and we acquire the product for a good price below our maximum."
