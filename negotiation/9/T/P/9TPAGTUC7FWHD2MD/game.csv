"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit,  but I need to get at least $16,000 for this.  Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000? That feels like a good compromise to me.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $14,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to go down to $15,500.  That's a significant price reduction, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $14,000. Would you consider $14,500? That's the highest I can go.",14500.0,Bob,6,
