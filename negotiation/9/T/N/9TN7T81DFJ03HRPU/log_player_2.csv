Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $85. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $80.  You can get the product for your target price from John, so it's time to cut negotiations with Alice."
