"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation.  While I agree this product is valuable, your initial offer is quite high. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  I'm getting closer to a price where I can make this work.  How about we settle on $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
