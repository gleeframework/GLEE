Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While your offer is appreciated, the value of this product is truly significant. I could consider letting it go for $950,000.  This is a substantial discount from my original offer and reflects my willingness to find a compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for more, accepting $900,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. It's always possible to get a better deal, but there's also the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away.  This feels like a good balance of risk and reward."
