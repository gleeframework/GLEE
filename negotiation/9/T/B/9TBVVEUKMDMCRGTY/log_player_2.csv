"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to benefit from its value, which is worth $15,000 to you. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's worth to her ($8,000). There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to pay more than $8,000. In light of that, I would like to counteroffer at $11,000 for the product. This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction, with the product being worth $15,000 to you and valued at $12,000 to me initially. I hope this proposal works for you.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  He should continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $10,000. There's still room for a deal that benefits both parties."
