"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $12000 is the highest I'm willing to go. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I've already offered you a discount from my initial price, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $13000. This is my final offer for now. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to pay $13000 or $12000. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?,11500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11500 and my previous offer of $13000, so I'm counteroffering at $12250. This is my best compromise for now.",12250.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to pay $12250. I'm willing to pay $11500, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying from someone else.",11500.0,Bob,8,
