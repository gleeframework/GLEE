"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm also leaving room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still maintaining a profit margin.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still being a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer in the next round.  While I could sell to John for $150, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm hoping a slightly higher counteroffer will get us there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but still maintaining a profit margin. We're close to the deal, and this counteroffer shows my flexibility while still staying within my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum price and represents a good profit. Accepting this offer is the best choice at this point.  While selling to John for $150 would guarantee a higher price, I'm concerned about risking missing out on a deal entirely if I continue to negotiate.  There's no guarantee that Bob will continue to increase his offer, and I risk running out of rounds.  It's better to take the $125 and close the deal."
