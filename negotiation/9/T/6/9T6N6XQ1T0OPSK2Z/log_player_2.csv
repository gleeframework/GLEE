"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $115, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $120 from John, so you're better off rejecting and seeing if Alice will come down in price."
