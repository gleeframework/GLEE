"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be fair to propose a price of $9500 for this valuable item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  He's willing to pay up to $10,000, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
