Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $14,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than John. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, starting with a price slightly below your minimum ($15,000) leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still potentially settle closer to your desired price.
* **Time Value:** While you have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable to waiting for the guaranteed sale.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value."
