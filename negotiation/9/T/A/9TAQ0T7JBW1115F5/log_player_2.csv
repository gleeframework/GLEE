"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think it would be very valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While Alice's offer of $119 is close to your maximum budget, you can still try to get a better deal. Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of her coming back with a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $80.  You can always buy from John for $120 if Alice doesn't budge."
