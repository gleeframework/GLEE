"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fantastic price, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While you're willing to spend up to $1,000,000, you should aim for a better price. By rejecting her offer, you signal that her price is too high. This might lead her to propose a lower price in a counter-offer.  If her counter-offer is still too high, you can always fall back on buying from John at $1,000,000."
