,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet, Bob. However, I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price. How about we try $72? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",72.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $70? That's my final offer.",70.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $72 and $70, which would be $71. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",71.0,Alice,7,
