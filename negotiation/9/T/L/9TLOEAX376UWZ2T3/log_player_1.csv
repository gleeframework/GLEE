Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the substantial benefits it offers. Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at that price to John gives you a strong position to negotiate from.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($2,250,000) sets an ""anchor"". While this might seem high, it leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob's eventual decision point seem more reasonable by comparison.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""immense value"" and ""substantial benefits"" subtly reinforces to Bob that the product is worth a premium. 
* **Backup Plan:** The safety net of John's offer allows for a bolder initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  There are arguments for offering a lower price to increase the likelihood of a quick sale. The best approach often depends on your risk tolerance and understanding of Bob's negotiating style (which we don't have information about in this scenario)."
