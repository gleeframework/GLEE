"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. Can you consider this price?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $18,000 is still a bit higher than my target price. I'm willing to go up to $16,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $16,000 is cutting it close, but I'm willing to accept that if it means closing the deal today.  What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,5,
