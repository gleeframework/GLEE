"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and its potential benefit to your business.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price from Alice.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,350,000. This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to get a reasonable price for my product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than her initial offer, he can still get the product for a lower price from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a price closer to John's offer."
