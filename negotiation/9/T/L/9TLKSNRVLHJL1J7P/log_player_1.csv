Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $15,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering what you're looking to get. Let's start with this and see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is too low for me to consider.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe in the value of this product, and I do too. However, I can't justify paying more than $9,000 right now. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
