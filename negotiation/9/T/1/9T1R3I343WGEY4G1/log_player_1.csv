"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a valuable piece, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable sale.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and encouraging, highlighting the product's value and aiming to establish a positive rapport. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm asking Bob for his thoughts, showing a willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $12000 for your product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or potentially even find a better deal with John later on.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $12,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. It's still a fair price for the value you'll get, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $18,000 to $16,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and how this price is still beneficial for him. 
* **Emphasize Win-Win:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, suggesting a mutually beneficial outcome.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob and allow us to finalize the deal.  If not, I'll continue negotiating strategically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on that, I would like to propose a price of $14000 for your product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still not quite there.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I still have six rounds left.  There's a good chance I can get Bob to increase his offer to my minimum or even higher.
* **John's offer:**  It's also important to remember that I can always sell to John for $15,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your latest offer. However, I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $14,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it ensures we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's last offer ($14,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Fair compromise:** I'm presenting this as a fair compromise, emphasizing a win-win outcome for both of us.
* **Final push:** I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the offer, but I'm still prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement, Alice. I'd like to counter with a price of $14000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise and I hope it works for you as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close but no cigar:** Bob's offer is still $500 below my minimum. 
* **Running out of time:**  I've only got four rounds left.  Even if Bob accepts my next counteroffer, there's no guarantee he won't try to lower the price again in subsequent rounds.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** I've already been offered $15,000 from John, which is my minimum. It's a guaranteed sale.

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the sale with John. It's a better long-term strategy to avoid potential risk and secure the best possible price."
