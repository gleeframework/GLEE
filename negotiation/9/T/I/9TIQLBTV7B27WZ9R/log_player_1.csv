Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find very valuable. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. I think it could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, vaguely mentioning the product's value to both you (""worth a significant amount to me"") and potentially him (""benefit you greatly"") might encourage him to consider a higher price. 
* **Alternative:** Bob knows he can get the product for $10,000 elsewhere, so Alice needs to provide an incentive for him to buy from her. By starting high, she creates a negotiating range and keeps the option of lowering the price if Bob counters.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. Depending on your risk tolerance and desired negotiation style, you could start with a different offer."
