Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I hope you'll consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective,  $2,000,000 represents a significant discount from my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,750,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product.  What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $1,750,000 is still more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly willing to move substantially on price, but we're still significantly above his initial offer.  There's room for negotiation to try and get closer to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's aim for a win-win.  How about we settle at $1,625,000? That's a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your need to make a profit,  $1,625,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  This price is fair, considering the value of the product to me and your need to make a sale.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has met our minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee we can get a better offer from him in the remaining rounds, and John offers the same amount. It's best to accept and avoid the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away."
