"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $10,500? This would allow both of us to make a fair deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,250? This is the best I can do, but I'm really interested in making a deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,
