{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be worth far more than the asking price in the long run. I'm proposing a price of $1,850,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy is based on the following:

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,850,000) than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) or my minimum ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This may make Bob perceive the final price as more reasonable, even if it's still significantly higher than his initial valuation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and potential for future returns aims to justify the high asking price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message invites Bob to discuss and potentially negotiate, showing flexibility while still aiming high. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** This strategy assumes Bob is somewhat risk-averse and might be willing to pay a premium to secure the product.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The presence of John guarantees a minimum sale price, allowing for a more aggressive approach with Bob."
