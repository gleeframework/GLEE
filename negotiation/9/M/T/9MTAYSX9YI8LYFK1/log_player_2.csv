"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum price of $100.
* **You have room to negotiate.**  You can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $85 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about $88?  Let's try to find a price we're both happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  You are willing to pay up to $100, and her offer is $88.
* **It's a good deal for you.**  You're saving $12 compared to buying from John.
* **There's no guarantee you'll get a better price.**  You've already rejected one counteroffer, and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but there's no guarantee you'll be able to get her down to your desired price.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product within your budget."
