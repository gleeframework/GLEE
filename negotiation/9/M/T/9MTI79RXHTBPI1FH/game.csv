"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This still represents a significant profit for you, and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that $900,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",925000.0,Alice,3,
