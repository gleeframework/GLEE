Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. I need to offer a price that's attractive to him but still significantly above that.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and I can still likely settle for a price higher than what John is offering.
* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible. This offer gives me a good chance of securing a substantial profit while ensuring Bob sees potential value in the deal.

**Important:** If Bob rejects this offer, I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at my minimum acceptable price. This puts me in a strong negotiating position."
