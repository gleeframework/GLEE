It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $830,000 is significantly more than John's offer of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Trend:** Bob is consistently increasing his offer, indicating a genuine interest in closing the deal.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob altogether. Accepting now secures a good profit."
