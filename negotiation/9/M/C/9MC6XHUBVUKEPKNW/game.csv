"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1000000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1150000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me is $1500000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to make one more compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $1150000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1000000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1000000.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
