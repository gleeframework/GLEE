I've decided to sell the product to John. I've had 8 rounds of negotiations with Bob and we haven't come to an agreement. Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not sure we'll be able to close the deal with only two rounds remaining.  To avoid risking a final rejection and losing out on a sale, it's safer to take John's offer, which guarantees me a fair price."
