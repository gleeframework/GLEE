"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm willing to start the negotiations at $1,400,000.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd need to see the price closer to $1,100,000 for it to make sense for me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're getting closer.  I appreciate the compromise. How about we settle at $1,175,000 and call it a deal?",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit away from your offer.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,212,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing us to close the deal. What do you think?",1212500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While your offer is tempting, I have a budget in mind.  I could do $1,190,000  to get this done today.  Let me know if that works for you.",1190000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about we meet at $1,200,000?  This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to come away from this deal satisfied. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
