"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1200000. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find extremely valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly at the maximum value I'm willing to pay. There's no immediate reason to accept.  I'll see if I can get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1100000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1150000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial price and closer to my target price. Accepting this offer would save me $50,000 compared to buying from John.  While I could try for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might reject my counteroffer and I would end up paying the full $1,200,000 to John."
