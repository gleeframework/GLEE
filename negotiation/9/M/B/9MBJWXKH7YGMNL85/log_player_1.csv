Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium over his perceived value. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob's estimated value, but still leaves room for potential negotiation if needed.
* **Alternative Secured:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm confident in securing my minimum acceptable price from John."
