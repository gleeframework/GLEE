"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price that's a bit lower than its true value. I'm offering it to you for $750,000.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point.  However, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer it to you for $700,000. This is my best price, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $680,000? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",680000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're getting closer to my initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $680,000. I'm willing to meet you at $720,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final compromise.",720000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference and settle at $700,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it for this product.",700000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $700,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer it to you for $740,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",740000.0,Alice,7,
