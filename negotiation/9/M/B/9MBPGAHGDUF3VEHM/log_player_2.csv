"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price that's a bit lower than its true value. I'm offering it to you for $750,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $750,000 is a decent starting point, there's room for negotiation. I'll aim lower to see if I can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point.  However, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $650,000?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer it to you for $700,000. This is my best price, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but I still think there's room to negotiate. I'll try another counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $680,000? That's a fair compromise, I believe."",
""product_price"": 680000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're getting closer to my initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $680,000. I'm willing to meet you at $720,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting firmer, but calling it her ""final compromise"" at this stage could be a tactic. I'll push one more time, but I'm also getting close to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference and settle at $700,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it for this product."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $700,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer it to you for $740,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $740,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from this point.  While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting slim compared to John's offer of $800,000. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
