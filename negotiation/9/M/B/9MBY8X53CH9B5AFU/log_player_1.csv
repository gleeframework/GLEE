Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure this product for a price closer to $1200000. This would still be a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, $1,200,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price before considering selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but let's meet in the middle.

What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1250000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a favorable outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not convinced it's the best deal. I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
