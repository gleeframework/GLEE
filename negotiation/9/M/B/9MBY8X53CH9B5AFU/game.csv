"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure this product for a price closer to $1200000. This would still be a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $1300000. This price still allows you to acquire something worth a lot more to you, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1250000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a favorable outcome.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial position. Let's compromise once more.  I'm offering the product to you for $1275000. This is a reasonable compromise and allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that still represents a significant gain.  Let's reach an agreement!",1275000.0,Alice,5,
