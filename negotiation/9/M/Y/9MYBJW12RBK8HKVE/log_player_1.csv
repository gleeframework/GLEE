"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it's important to establish a high starting point to maximize potential profit. 

Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to engage in negotiations. This will provide me with valuable information to guide my subsequent offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I cannot accept such a low offer.  While I want to make a deal, I won't sell myself short.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000.  This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer. This signals flexibility, but it's also a price I'm comfortable with.  I'm trying to find a middle ground between my desired profit and a price that Bob might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I'm not yet ready to accept this offer.  I'll reject it and continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get a better price.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm reducing my offer to $1,600,000.  This is still above my minimum acceptable price, and it shows continued flexibility. I'm trying to find a price point that Bob might find appealing, while still ensuring I get a good return.  It's a calculated risk, as I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I believe this move will increase the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I'm not willing to accept such a low offer. It's important to remember that I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 at any point, so I don't need to settle for a price that's too far below my minimum. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob. There's still time for a better offer, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer to $1,450,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe this offer is reasonable and shows flexibility. I'm hoping Bob sees that we are getting close to a deal, and he will be willing to meet me in the middle. If he rejects, I will have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. With only two rounds remaining, I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob.  I'm also considering the risk of continuing the negotiation and possibly ending with no deal.  Therefore, it's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 by selling to John."
