{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a positive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer.  By starting at $100, I'm aiming for a profit that's better than selling to John, but still potentially appealing to Bob.  I'll be ready to adjust the price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my preferred outcome. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $95.  It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, could you possibly lower the price to $90? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is the best I can get, and it still brings me a profit.  It's better than selling to John, so I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
