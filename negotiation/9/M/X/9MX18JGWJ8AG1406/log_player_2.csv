{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since I'm aiming for the lowest price possible, I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. $7,500 is a substantial discount, and it leaves room for further negotiation if needed."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my maximum limit. I can continue negotiating and try to push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last offer was $8,500, and I'm willing to pay up to $8,000. This counteroffer is a compromise, showing a willingness to meet her halfway while staying within my budget.  It also gives me a chance to close the deal before I have to resort to John's offer."
