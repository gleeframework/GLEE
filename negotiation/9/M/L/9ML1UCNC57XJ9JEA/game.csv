"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $9,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? It's the absolute maximum I can afford right now.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $8,600? This is truly my final offer.",8600.0,Bob,4,
