"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $160. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",160.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $170. Is this a more acceptable price for you?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $155 for the product. Would you be willing to accept that price?",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering at $165. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $157.50 for the product. Would you be willing to accept that price?",157.5,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $165 is too low for me, so I'm going to try to meet you in the middle of $157.50 and $165. I'm offering the product to you for $161.25. This is my final concession, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",161.25,Alice,7,

"I understand you're making a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $165. I'm not comfortable with the price of $159, and I'm starting to think that selling it to you isn't the best option for me. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet my minimum price, so I'm counteroffering at $165. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",165.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to meet your minimum price. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement. My final offer is $158.50. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",158.5,Bob,10,
