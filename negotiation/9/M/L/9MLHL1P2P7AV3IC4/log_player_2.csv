"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. Given its high value and quality, we believe it's worth every penny of the $1,200,000. Let's make this a win-win situation by discussing terms that suit both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to me,  I want to try and negotiate a lower price. There are still 10 rounds, so I have time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, reflecting the value I place on it."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of our product. To find common ground, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This still reflects its true value while allowing for a more manageable transaction for you. I hope we can move forward with this arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. There are still rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal. I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing for a successful transaction."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. In light of our previous discussions, I am prepared to offer the product at $1,075,000. This price reflects the value of the product while remaining within your budget constraints. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is a significant reduction from her initial offer and closer to my desired price point. While I could try for a lower price, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and me having to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  I'm comfortable accepting this offer and securing the product."
