"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe $2,300,000 is a fair reflection of its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $2,050,000?",2050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
