Round 6
Bob's offer:

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,750,000 is a strategic move:

* **Significant Profit:** This price still yields a $250,000 profit over my minimum and John's standing offer.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging negotiations risks Bob lowering his offer or me having to settle for John's offer later.
* **Bird in Hand:**  A confirmed sale now is better than the uncertainty of a potentially better deal later."
