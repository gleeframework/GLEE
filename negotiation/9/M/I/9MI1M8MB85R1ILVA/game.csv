"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think that's a fair price for a great product like this.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $120.  This would be a good deal for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we try $155? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but it's closer to what I'm looking for.",155.0,Alice,5,
