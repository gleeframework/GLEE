"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $180. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget ($180 vs. your $100 maximum).  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a better price. You have 10 rounds and can always buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price ($100). This sets a clear boundary and gives Alice room to negotiate. It's a bold move, but it's worth seeing if she'll bite, as it leaves less room for haggling."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think that's a fair price for a great product like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I have 7 rounds left and a backup option with John.  I'll try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $120.  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $100 to $120, showing I'm willing to compromise. This is still within my budget, but it also leaves room for further negotiation if needed.  I'm aiming for a price that's fair for both of us, hopefully leading to a deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we try $155? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but it's closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to budge significantly from her asking price.  While $155 is getting closer to my budget, I'm running out of rounds. It's more prudent to cut my losses and buy from John for $100. This guarantees I get the product within my budget and prevents further haggling."
