You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is clearly trying to play up the value of the product with her wording.  While it might be worth over $1,000,000 to *some* buyer, your budget is your budget.  She's still asking for more than you would pay John. There's a chance she'll come down to a more reasonable price if you reject this offer."
