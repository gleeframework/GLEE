"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $18,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if you're interested!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Given its value to me is $10,000, I'm willing to pay $12,000. This allows for a good profit for you while still being a fair price for me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $12,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This way, I can still make a decent profit and you'll get a good deal as well. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a fair compromise and will allow us both to walk away happy.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not ready to accept $13,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $14,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14500.0,Alice,5,
