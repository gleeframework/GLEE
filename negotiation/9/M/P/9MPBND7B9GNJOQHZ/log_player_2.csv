"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $18,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far more than Bob is willing to pay. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $12,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This way, I can still make a decent profit and you'll get a good deal as well. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is better than $18,000, it's still more than Bob is comfortable paying. Bob can continue negotiating with Alice or just buy the product from John for $10,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not ready to accept $13,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $14,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice is willing to negotiate, she's still offering a price that's higher than Bob's maximum. At this point, it makes more sense for Bob to secure the product from John at a price he's comfortable with."
