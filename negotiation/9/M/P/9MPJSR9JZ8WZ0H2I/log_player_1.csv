"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it immediately seems unreasonable. 
* **Positive message:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for negotiation:** This price gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a profit.

**Important Note:**  While I'm starting high, I'm aware that I have the option to sell to John for $100 at any time. This gives me a safety net and allows me to be more aggressive in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's willing to negotiate. I have 8 rounds left to try and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's offer is a backup:**  I can always sell to John for $100, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob at a low price.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90 to make this deal work. Let's find a middle ground. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer to show my willingness to negotiate.
* **Bridging the gap:**  $90 is a compromise that's closer to my minimum price but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing finding a solution that benefits both of us.

**Important Note:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind. I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, but I won't be swayed by unreasonable offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. How about we split the difference and settle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and we've already established a range. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I have the option to sell to John for $100, which provides me with leverage.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll likely aim for something in the $80-$85 range to try and meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $75 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $82.50?  That's a fair compromise, and it would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer to show my willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the middle:** $82.50 is exactly halfway between my last offer ($90) and Bob's offer ($75). This shows I'm committed to finding a solution.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing a ""good deal"" for both parties.
* **Staying above my minimum:** I'm still above my minimum price of $100, which gives me some wiggle room.

**Important Note:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind. If Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price, I'll be prepared to sell to John in the next round."
