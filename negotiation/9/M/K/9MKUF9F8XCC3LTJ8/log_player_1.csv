Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in great condition and I know it'll be worth it to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $14,000 is lower than Bob's value of $15,000, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's a fair offer:**  It leaves room for both of you to potentially get a better deal. 

This strategy is designed to create a starting point for negotiation while still protecting your minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is better than $12,000 (John's offer), it's still below my desired profit margin. There's still room for negotiation, as Bob clearly sees value in the product. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially reaching a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This would allow me to make a fair profit while still offering you a great deal on this valuable product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
