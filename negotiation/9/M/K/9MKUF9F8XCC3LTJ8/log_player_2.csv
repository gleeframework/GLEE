"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in great condition and I know it'll be worth it to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000.** 
* **It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price.** There's a potential for saving money by rejecting the offer and counter-offering.  
* **Buying from John immediately would cost you $15,000.**  While this is your backup plan, you can potentially do better by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This would allow me to make a fair profit while still offering you a great deal on this valuable product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget and a good deal.** You're getting the product for $1,500 less than what John is selling it for.
* **Continuing to negotiate might lead to further price reductions, but it's also risky.** You could end up losing the deal to another buyer or having to pay John's higher price in the end.
* **It's important to strike a balance between getting the best price and not losing the opportunity.**  $13,500 is a fair compromise and a good value for you."
