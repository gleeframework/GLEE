"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. While I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,500 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. My next counteroffer is $13,500. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing this negotiation.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still above what I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $12,000?  I believe that's a fair offer considering the current market.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really serious about getting this product, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to think that $12,000 is getting closer to a reasonable price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",12500.0,Alice,7,
