Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really serious about getting this product, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to think that $12,000 is getting closer to a reasonable price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $12,500.  While she hints at it being a ""reasonable price,"" she's still holding out for a profit. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed offer for $12,000 from John."
