Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand this is your final offer, Alice, and it's a tempting one. To be honest, $10,000 is what I had budgeted for this purchase.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I've stated my final offer. It's unlikely he'll move significantly from this point, and I risk getting into a protracted negotiation. John offers a guaranteed $10,000, which is acceptable.  It's time to move on to a sure thing."
