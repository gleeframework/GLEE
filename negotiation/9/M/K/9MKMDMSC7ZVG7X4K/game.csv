"Alice,  $25000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in this product but I'm only willing to go up to $15000.  What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Would you be willing to consider $20000?",20000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not sure if $18000 is the best we can do. How about we meet at $22000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings",22000.0,Alice,5,
