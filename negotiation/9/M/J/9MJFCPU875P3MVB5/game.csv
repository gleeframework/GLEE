"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my minimum target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that final offer is still a bit rich for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $787,500?  That's a firm offer from me.",787500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $787,500 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $795,000. This is my last offer, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close. I can tell you're firm on that $800,000 mark, so I'm willing to make a small jump to get this deal done. How about $790,000? That's my best and final offer.",790000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $795,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,9,
