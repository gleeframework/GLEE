"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is out of my range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $8,500 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This is a very fair price for a product of this quality.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm trying to be fair with my pricing.  Let's make this work - how about $11,000?  That's my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still beyond my limit.  I'm willing to go to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. If you're serious about selling, this is the best I can do. Let's make this deal happen.",10000.0,Bob,6,
