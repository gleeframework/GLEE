Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 just doesn't cover the true value of this product. I'm willing to make a final concession - how about $15,500?  This is a very fair price that acknowledges both our needs.  Let me know if you're interested, as I'm also in talks with another buyer who is willing to pay my asking price.
