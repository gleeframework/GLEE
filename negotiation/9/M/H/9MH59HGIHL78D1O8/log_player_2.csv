Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $550,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your top end is $520,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $530,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Alice has stated this is her final offer and she's already moved closer to your price twice.  While you could try another counteroffer, you risk her walking away entirely. Accepting at $530,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's $800,000 price."
