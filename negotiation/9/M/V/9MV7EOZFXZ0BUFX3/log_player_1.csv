"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. If Bob rejects, we can negotiate down. However, if he accepts, great!  I'm also keeping an eye on John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more.  I have 9 rounds left and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm reducing the price to $1,200,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a significant profit margin. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to him than his initial offer."
