While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for me. I'm going to try and negotiate further."

# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a premium support package. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great value. What do you think?

Alice has come down a bit, but the extras she's offering aren't enough to justify the extra cost for me. I'm going to take the guaranteed deal from John and save myself some money."
