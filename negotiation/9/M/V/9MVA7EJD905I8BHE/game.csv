"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $11,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that you've already lowered your price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a premium support package. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
