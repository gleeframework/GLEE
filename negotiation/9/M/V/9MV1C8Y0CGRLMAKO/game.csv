"Thank you for considering my proposal, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand its significance to our business. However, given our current budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with our financial planning.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is significantly below the value this product brings to your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000,  which still reflects the substantial benefits you'll gain.  I believe this price point represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline. Given our budgetary constraints, I am unable to meet your proposed price of $1,050,000. I would like to propose an alternative price of $1,000,000. This is the highest amount we can afford while still ensuring we can allocate funds for other critical business expenses. I hope this revised offer is within your consideration.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
