Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $8,750 is still a bit too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,875.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $8,800 is a good deal and allows me to make a profit.  It's getting late in the game and I don't want to risk losing this deal altogether."
