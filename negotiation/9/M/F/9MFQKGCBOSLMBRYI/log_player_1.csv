{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to get a deal quickly, I'm holding out for closer to my minimum value. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm offering Bob a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial asking price, but it's still above Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum value."

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still too low. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,050,000.  This is a significant move, as it's now below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  However, I believe this price is still fair, given Bob's willingness to negotiate and the limited rounds remaining."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,000,000 at this point. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only three rounds remaining, the negotiation isn't progressing quickly enough. Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum value. I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John. I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
