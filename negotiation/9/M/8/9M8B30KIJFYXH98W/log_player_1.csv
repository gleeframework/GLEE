Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up towards his maximum perceived value of $1,000,000. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
