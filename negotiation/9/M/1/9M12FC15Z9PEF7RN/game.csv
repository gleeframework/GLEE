"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of this unique item.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for this unique product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
