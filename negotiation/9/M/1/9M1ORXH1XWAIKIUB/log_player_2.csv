Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this deal work, I need to be at $1,325,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident this price still represents excellent value for you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.
