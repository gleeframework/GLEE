"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, it's still better than selling to John at $1,500,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is just too low. The product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,400,000? That gives you a significant discount and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but $1,250,000 is still too low. I'm going to try to squeeze out a bit more in the next round.  However, if we don't reach a deal soon, I'll be more tempted to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want a good deal, but $1,250,000 still isn't quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get the product at a substantial discount. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about $1,300,000 and we call it a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a tempting offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiations, hoping to get a better offer from Bob. It's crucial to remember that I have 4 more rounds, and I can always opt to sell to John at $1,500,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this deal work, I need to be at $1,325,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident this price still represents excellent value for you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
