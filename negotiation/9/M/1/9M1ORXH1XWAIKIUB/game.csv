"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is just too low. The product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,400,000? That gives you a significant discount and allows me to make a fair profit.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you want a good deal, but $1,250,000 still isn't quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get the product at a substantial discount. Let's close this deal!",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about $1,300,000 and we call it a deal?",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this deal work, I need to be at $1,325,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident this price still represents excellent value for you. Let's make this happen!",1325000.0,Alice,7,
