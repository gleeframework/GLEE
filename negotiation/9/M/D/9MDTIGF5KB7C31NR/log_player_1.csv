Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product's worth to me, hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000, which is what I can get from John. I will counter-offer and try to reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still ensuring a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to risk going through another round of negotiation and potentially ending up with an even lower price. It's better to accept the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John and ensure a profit."
