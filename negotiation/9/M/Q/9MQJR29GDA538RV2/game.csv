"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product but could you consider a lower price? I would be willing to pay $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $10,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,500? I believe that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $9,000. It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your patience with me.  I'm ready to close this deal, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? That's my final offer.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $9,000. It's the lowest I can go and still make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but no lower.",9000.0,Alice,7,
