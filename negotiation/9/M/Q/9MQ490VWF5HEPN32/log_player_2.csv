# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'm excited about the opportunity to acquire the product. However, I have to consider the value I can get from other sellers. Since I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, I'd rather not overpay. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer.
