{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love.  I'm willing to let it go for $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're not giving away the product for less than your minimum value.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  You've created space for negotiation without jeopardizing your profit. 

Keep in mind, you can adjust the price based on Bob's response and your comfort level with negotiating. Good luck!"
