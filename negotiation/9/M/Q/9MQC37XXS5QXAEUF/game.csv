"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $850,000, which is a 5% discount from my initial offer. This is my final offer, so I hope you can consider it seriously.",850000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I understand this is your final offer, I'm still not comfortable with that price point.  To be fair to both of us,  would you consider $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better price, but I've already discounted the price by 10% from my initial offer. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $820,000, which is just $30,000 more than your last offer. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope you can consider it seriously.",820000.0,Alice,5,,
