"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm looking for a significant return on my investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
