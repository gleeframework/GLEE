"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. Can you meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. I really like the product and I think it's worth it to me at that price. Can you consider my offer?",100.0,Bob,4,
