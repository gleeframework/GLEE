"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to do $12,500? That's the absolute maximum I can go at this time. ",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,200. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle from there.",13200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks again for your offer. $13,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not quite there on price. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, but that's as low as I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",13500.0,Alice,5,
