Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $11,000 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $11,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $12,250. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to go up to $11,900, but no more. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,900

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I don't want to risk going through more rounds and getting an even lower offer.  Selling to John for $12,000 is the best option for me."
