You can do better than $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

This is a reasonable counteroffer that is still below your maximum price, but leaves room for further negotiation.  You're demonstrating a willingness to compromise while also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a good deal for you.  It's still below your maximum price and likely much closer to her minimum than your last offer. Accepting this deal is a good way to secure the product without risking further negotiation."
