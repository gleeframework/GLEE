"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $9,500.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,000?  This would still be a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $8,750 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
