Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) as possible while still exceeding John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $1,150,000 creates a sense of urgency (""one-time offer"") and positions the price as a potential bargain for Bob, encouraging him to accept before losing the opportunity. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, we're secure knowing John will buy it at our desired price."
