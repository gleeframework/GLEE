# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its market value to you is $15000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You value the product at $15,000 and Alice is offering it for $12,000. This saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You want to save as much money as possible.** Even though you could get the product for your maximum price from John, Alice's offer allows you to get it for less."
