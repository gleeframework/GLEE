You can save money by negotiating with Alice.  Since the product is worth $150 to you, and only $80 to Alice, there's room for a better price.  Let's see if you can get a lower offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate it.  However, I'm hoping to get a better price.  Would you consider $100?  I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I need to make sure I get a fair value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

You are still closer to your ideal price, and Alice is willing to negotiate. Let's see if you can get another price reduction."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and go with $105? This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $115. I think that's the minimum I need to make it worth my while. Would you be willing to meet me at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While you'd ideally like a lower price, Alice is firm at $115.  This is still a good deal for you, saving you $35 compared to buying from John.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action."
