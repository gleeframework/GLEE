,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $850000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $950000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still not quite there. $950000 is pushing my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $900000. This price is still a good deal for both of us and allows for a quick and agreeable sale.",900000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. $925000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $910000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of this product for me.  Let's close this deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,
