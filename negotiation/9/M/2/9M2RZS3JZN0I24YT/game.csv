"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is my final compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
