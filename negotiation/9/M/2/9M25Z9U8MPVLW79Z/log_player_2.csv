"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll derive from it. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering your minimum price and the value it brings to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise. It's still below Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000, and it's likely that Alice won't go lower.  Accepting this offer secures the product for Bob at a reasonable price."
