Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $9,500 is higher than the $8,000 Bob values the product at, giving him a potential benefit from buying it.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring you earn more than your minimum of $10,000. 
* **It's a strong opening:** Showing confidence in your product by offering a slightly higher price can make Bob more willing to negotiate.

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,200 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,200 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $8,800? This still gives you a good price while allowing me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 8800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I've already found another seller who is willing to sell it to me for this price, so I'm not sure I can go any higher than this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While it's tempting to keep negotiating,  I'm confident that John will buy my product for $10,000. It's not worth risking a lower price when I have a guaranteed buyer willing to pay my minimum."
