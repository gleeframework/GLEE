"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I do appreciate the value this product holds for me, $12,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $11,000? This way, you'll get a great deal on the product, and I'll still earn a decent profit. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
