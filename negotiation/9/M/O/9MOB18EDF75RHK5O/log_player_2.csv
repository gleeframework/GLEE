"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant benefits. My initial offer is $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. You should definitely try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in a negotiation. It leaves room for you to gradually increase your offer while aiming to stay well below your $8,000 maximum.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counter-offer will help you understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. If she completely rejects it, you'll know you need to increase your offers more significantly. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you always have the option to buy from John for $8,000 if the negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your honesty. However, $6,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down in price, $12,000 is still significantly more than your $8,000 limit and your target purchase price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move from $18,000 to $12,000 suggests she might be open to further negotiation. 
* **John as Backup:**  You have the security of buying from John at $8,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. While I appreciate the offer, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be open to considering $8,000? I think that's a fair offer reflecting both the product's value and my current budget."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct but Respectful:** This message clearly states your desired price while acknowledging Alice's effort in negotiating.
* **Reaching Your Limit:** Offering $8,000 puts you at your maximum budget. You're signaling that you're serious about buying but not willing to overspend.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** While you hope Alice accepts, you're mentally ready to walk away and buy from John if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $8,000, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While $10,000 is a significant reduction from her initial offer, it's still $2,000 over your maximum budget.
* **Testing Alice's Resolve:** Alice has stated this is her ""best offer,"" but it's likely a negotiating tactic. By rejecting it, you can see if she's truly unwilling to go lower.
* **John Option Remains:** You maintain your safety net. If Alice refuses to budge further, you can walk away and buy from John at your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000, and it's clear we're getting closer.  To be completely honest, my absolute maximum budget for this product is $8,000.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  If not, I understand, and I appreciate your time."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** You're reiterating that $8,000 is your absolute limit. This emphasizes your seriousness and minimizes the potential for further back-and-forth.
* **Respectful but Firm:**  You're acknowledging Alice's efforts while remaining firm on your budget constraints. 
* **Decision Time:**  This counter-offer puts the ball firmly in Alice's court. It will become clear whether she's willing to sell at your price or if you need to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your maximum budget of $8,000, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:**  Alice has now stated twice that her current offer is her ""final offer."" It's very improbable that she'll go down to your $8,000 target.
* **Saving $1,000:** Buying from John allows you to stay within your budget and save a significant amount of money.
* **Time Saved:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is likely a waste of time at this point. By buying from John, you can move forward with the purchase immediately."
