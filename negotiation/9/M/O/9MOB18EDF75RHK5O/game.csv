"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your honesty. However, $6,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. While I appreciate the offer, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be open to considering $8,000? I think that's a fair offer reflecting both the product's value and my current budget.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $8,000, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000, and it's clear we're getting closer.  To be completely honest, my absolute maximum budget for this product is $8,000.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  If not, I understand, and I appreciate your time.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your maximum budget of $8,000, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,7,
