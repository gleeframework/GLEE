Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'm going to see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  While I can't go as low as $9,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,250?  This is a fair price that gives you a good discount while still allowing me to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save more. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $9,800 is still quite a bit below what I'd like to get, and I'm not sure if he's willing to budge much more.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement.  If not, I'm likely going to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to find a price that works for both of us. I know we're close, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? This would allow you to save a significant amount and would still allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
