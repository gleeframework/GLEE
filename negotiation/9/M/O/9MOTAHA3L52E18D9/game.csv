"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to your business. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a substantial opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly below its market value. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
