Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This price is higher than my minimum value of $80, and leaves room for potential negotiation. It's also a significant discount for Bob, making it likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer of $90. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counter-offering at $100. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $150. It's also a compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $95.  While I'd prefer a bit more, it's a significant improvement over selling to John and it seems like we've reached a point where further negotiation might be unproductive."
