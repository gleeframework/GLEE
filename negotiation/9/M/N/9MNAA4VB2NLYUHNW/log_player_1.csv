Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $1,900,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for a price closer to $1,000,000. I believe this would be a fair offer considering its true market value.

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, his final offer is still significantly less than what John is offering.  There's no guarantee Bob will go any higher, and it makes more financial sense to accept the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
