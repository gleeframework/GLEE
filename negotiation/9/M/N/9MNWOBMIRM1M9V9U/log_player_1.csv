Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product much higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows for a significant margin.
* **Strong Opening:** A starting price closer to Bob's valuation sets a strong anchor for the negotiation.
* **Time Pressure:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds urgency and discourages Bob from delaying or lowballing. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a fallback plan with John, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed if Bob declines. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal from Bob while acknowledging the potential for negotiation."
