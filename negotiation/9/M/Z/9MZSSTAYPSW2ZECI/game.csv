"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I'd get elsewhere and still allows you a substantial profit margin. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still allows you a decent profit margin, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price point, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 as a final offer. This is a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go. If this doesn't work, I'll have to move forward with another buyer.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
