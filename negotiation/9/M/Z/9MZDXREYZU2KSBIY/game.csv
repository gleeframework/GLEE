"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to consider the value I've put into this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. I'm counteroffering at $1,550,000. This is my final concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
