Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even exceeding $1,200,000. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, starting with a price of $1,500,000 aims high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows Alice to secure a price significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:**  The message hints that the product's value to Bob might be even higher than his initial assessment, justifying the higher price. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone remains open for discussion, inviting Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too steep. 

**Important Note:**  Alice has a strong fallback position with John willing to pay $1,200,000.  This allows her to be more assertive in her negotiation with Bob."
