Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $115. I think you'll find it's a very fair price."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I start with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 offer leaves space for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential compromise that still earns me more than my minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Alternative Option:** I keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product and am willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I know the product is worth more to him. Rejecting his initial offer opens the door for further negotiation. I'll aim for a price closer to $110, still leaving me with a profit margin above selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, I'm looking for something closer to $110 for this product. It truly is worth it."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm coming down from my initial offer ($115) and meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($100) and my original ask. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to nudge Bob towards accepting a slightly higher price.
* **Backup Plan:** I still have the option to sell to John for $100 if Bob remains firm, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your valuation of the product, but I would like to stick to my previous offer of $100. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Bob seems firm on $100, and pushing for more might make him walk away.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Accepting his offer secures a $100 profit, which is still a positive outcome compared to not selling the product at all. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a cost, as I might miss the opportunity to sell the product to other potential buyers in the meantime."
