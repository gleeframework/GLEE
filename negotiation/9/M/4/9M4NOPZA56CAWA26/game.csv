"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $160 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $80 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you place on it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $140? That's a $20 discount from my original offer and ensures I'm getting closer to the product's true value.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference at $110? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
