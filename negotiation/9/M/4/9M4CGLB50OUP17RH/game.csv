"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. This price is a fair compromise that reflects the value we both place on the product.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
