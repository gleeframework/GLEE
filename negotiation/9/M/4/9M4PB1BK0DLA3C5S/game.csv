"Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet in the middle.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest, however, $7,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you meet me at $10,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go much higher than that.",8500.0,Bob,4,
