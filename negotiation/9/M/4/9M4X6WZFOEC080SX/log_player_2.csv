"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product at a price that's significantly lower than its true market value. While I understand its worth to you is closer to $1,500,000, I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000.  This is a fantastic deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested, and we can finalize the details.
