"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $850,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $900,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns.",900000.0,Alice,3,
