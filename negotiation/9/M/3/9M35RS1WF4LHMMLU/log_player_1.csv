Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting.  Here's why:

* **Higher than John's offer:**  $120 is significantly higher than the $80 I'd get from John, ensuring a larger profit for me.
* **Lower than Bob's value:**  $120 is still less than the $150 Bob values the product at, making it a good deal for him and increasing the likelihood of his acceptance."
