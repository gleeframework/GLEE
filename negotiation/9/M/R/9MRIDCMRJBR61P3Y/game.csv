"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a reasonable price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $97?  That's a fair compromise.",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $97 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $102? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",102.0,Alice,5,
