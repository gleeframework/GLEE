"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the initial offer. He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $10,000. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  By rejecting, Bob can try to secure a lower price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's minimum price of $10,000. This shows he's serious about buying but also wants a good deal.  Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can likely still get a better deal. He should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to $10,500. The option to buy from John for $12,000 remains a fallback if negotiations with Alice stall or become too unfavorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  Offering $10,750 is still well below Alice's current offer of $11,200, giving Alice an incentive to negotiate.  This counteroffer also keeps Bob within his budget, allowing him to potentially save money while securing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offers.  While she's inching closer to his ideal price, he's still within his budget and has the option to buy from John as a fallback.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should aim for a lower price than $11,400.  By rejecting, he can potentially secure a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but still keeping it below Alice's current price of $11,400. This demonstrates a continued willingness to negotiate while remaining within his budget.  Offering $11,000 is a compromise, showing Bob is serious about buying the product.  By raising his offer, he is trying to meet Alice halfway while still aiming for a price lower than John's offer of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At $11,600, the price is within his budget and only $400 more than his last counteroffer.  While he could continue negotiating, the risk of getting a worse deal from Alice or having to buy from John at $12,000 is high.  

Here's why:

* **Limited Rounds:** Only three rounds remain. Continuing to negotiate might result in Alice becoming less willing to lower her price, potentially leading to a higher price than the current offer.
* **John's Price:**  John's offer is only $400 higher than Alice's current offer. This makes Alice's offer a better deal, even with a small compromise. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  After multiple rounds, the negotiation process can become tiresome. Accepting Alice's offer saves time and effort, allowing Bob to move on.

By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product for a reasonable price within his budget, while also minimizing the risk of a worse outcome."
