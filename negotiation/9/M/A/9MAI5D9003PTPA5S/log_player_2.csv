"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to go lower and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1150000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price and see if Alice is willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,150,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  This would allow both of us to walk away satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1100000, which would be $1125000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate and has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  Accepting the offer at $1,125,000 saves Bob a significant amount compared to buying from John and allows the negotiation to come to a successful close. While there is still room for further negotiation, the potential risk of pushing too hard and losing the deal is high, especially considering there are only a few rounds left."
