You have three options:

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $120 is a bit high, there's room to haggle."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice is meeting us in the middle, and $110 is a reasonable price. It's better to save some money and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
