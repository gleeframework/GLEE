"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for, but I'm willing to give you a 5% discount for being a serious buyer. So, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,140,000.",1140000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be totally transparent, my budget caps out at $1,000,000 for this. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're serious about the product, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,140,000, as that's the minimum I need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight concession, though. I'll throw in some additional services and support worth $20,000, so the effective price would be $1,120,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",1120000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the additional offer, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is really the most I can do.  I'm very interested in the product, but not at a price that breaks my budget.  Let me know if you reconsider.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
