"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations at $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  Let's try to find some middle ground. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I still think $925,000 is a bit low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's try $975,000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I think we're getting close. How about we split the difference and call it a deal at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like the idea of splitting the difference, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $960,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. This is my final offer, so I hope we can agree on this price.",960000.0,Alice,7,
