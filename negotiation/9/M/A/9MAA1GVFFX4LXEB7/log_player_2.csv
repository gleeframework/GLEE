Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the idea of splitting the difference, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $960,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. This is my final offer, so I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm and her offer of $960,000 is a significant discount from her initial price. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk that she'll walk away, leaving us to buy from John at $1,000,000. Accepting her offer guarantees a saving of $40,000 compared to John's price, which is a good outcome."
