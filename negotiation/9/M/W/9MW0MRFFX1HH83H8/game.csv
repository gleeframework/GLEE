"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for you, but $600,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is the best I can do for now.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground, Alice. However, $850,000 is still pushing my budget. Would you be willing to settle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise further, but $725,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer for now.",800000.0,Alice,5,
