Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within my budget:** $887,500 is a fair price considering my maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price:** Alice has already come down significantly, and it's doubtful she'll go lower.
* **It's a good deal:**  Accepting the offer means I can secure the product at a price that's still advantageous to me, saving $112,500 compared to buying from John."
