"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I believe will be a significant asset to your business. While it's worth a considerable sum to me, I understand it holds a different value to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its potential for your company.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested party willing to purchase it for a higher amount. Let me know your decision at your earliest convenience.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
