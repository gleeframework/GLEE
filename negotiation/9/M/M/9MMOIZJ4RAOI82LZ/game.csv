"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is a good price, I'm not quite ready to let it go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's fair for me.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work.  How about we split the difference and go with $97.50?  It's just a little more than your last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",97.5,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you to find a price that works for both of us. I'm not comfortable going lower than $95, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $93.50. This is a great price for the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?",93.5,Alice,7,
