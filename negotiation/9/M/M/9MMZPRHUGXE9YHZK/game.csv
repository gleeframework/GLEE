"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. While I can't disclose the exact details of the product at this time, I can assure you that it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000, a price that reflects its true value and provides a reasonable margin for both of us. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
