"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 seems a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $900000? I think that's a fair price for a product of this caliber.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1200000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $950000? I'm really interested in the product and I think that's a fair price for it.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. However, $1025000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1025000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $1012500? That's the highest price I'm willing to pay.",1012500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm surprised you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1012500.
