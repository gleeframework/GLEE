"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $120 for the product, and John is also offering it for $120, there's no benefit in accepting Alice's offer. You can get the product for the same price from John."
