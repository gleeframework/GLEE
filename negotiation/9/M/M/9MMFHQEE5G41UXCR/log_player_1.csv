"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can't exceed $9000 for it. Could we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. There's still room for negotiation and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $9,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget constraints, I would like to propose $10000 as the price. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal.  I am confident I can get closer to my desired price, especially with only 6 rounds left.  I will counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $10500 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I have 4 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer again and try to get a bit closer to my target of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $11,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of what you're getting.  Let's try to reach a deal in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. Based on my budget and the value of the product, I am willing to pay $11000 for it. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, it's unlikely I can get a price that's significantly higher than Bob's current offer of $11,000.  While this is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, selling to John guarantees me my desired price. It's a safer and more profitable option at this point."
