Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a high price for the product. However, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that she won't go below $1,050,000, and I'm not willing to pay that much.  With only one round left, it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement.  Since I can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, it's in my best interest to go with that option.  While it's not the lowest price, it's a reasonable compromise."
