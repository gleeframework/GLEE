"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We can definitely negotiate a better price than $1,200,000.  Alice is clearly starting high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to anchor the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's opening price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Aiming for Savings:** While we're willing to pay John $1,000,000, our goal is to maximize savings. Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer increases our chances of landing somewhere between $800,000 and $1,000,000.
* **Leaving Negotiating Room:**  We don't want to lowball so much that Alice walks away. This counteroffer leaves room for her to come down while still giving us a chance for significant savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress Made:** Alice came down from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, indicating she's willing to negotiate.
* **Room for Improvement:**  We're still $100,000 away from our backup option with John. There's room for Alice to reduce the price further.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** By continuing to counter, we demonstrate our seriousness about getting a good deal and push Alice closer to our desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're proposing a price directly in the middle of her current offer ($1,100,000) and our previous counteroffer ($800,000). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is still $50,000 less than our guaranteed option with John, maintaining pressure on Alice to move closer to our desired range.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** By using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""working with me,"" we're trying to create a more collaborative tone and encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer.
* **Minimal Savings:**  Alice's final offer is only $50,000 less than John's price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing the negotiation carries the risk that Alice won't budge further, forcing us to accept a worse deal or start over with another seller.  The potential savings are not worth the risk. 

It's been a good negotiation attempt with Alice, but at this point, John's offer is the more sensible choice."
