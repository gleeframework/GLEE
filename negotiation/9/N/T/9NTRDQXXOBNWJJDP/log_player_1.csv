Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but I can only pay up to $8,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need at least $9,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm still not able to go above $8,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I believe I can get closer to my target price of $10,000 if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not comfortable dropping below $9,000. This product is valuable, and I believe it's worth that price. Let's meet halfway at $9,500. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've done some research and found out that the product is worth less than what you're asking. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which I believe is a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I don't believe his ""research"" is accurate.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not convinced by your research.  I'm confident in the value of this product, and $8,500 simply doesn't reflect that.  This is my final offer: $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I respect your decision, but I still believe $8,500 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go one step further and offer $8,750. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 2 rounds left, and Bob's offers still below my minimum acceptable price, it's time to cut my losses and sell to John. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's the best I can do under the circumstances."
