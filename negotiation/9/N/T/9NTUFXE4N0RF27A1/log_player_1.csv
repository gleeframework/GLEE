I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm still determined to get a better price, and while John is a safe option, I think I can get more from Bob. I'll try to meet him in the middle with a counteroffer."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. While I'd like to get more from Bob, it's becoming clear that he's not willing to budge much further.  It's not worth risking another few rounds and potentially ending up with a lower price than what John is offering."
