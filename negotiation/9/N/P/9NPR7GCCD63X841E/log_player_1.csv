{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $125 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $100, maximizing your potential profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  $125 is still significantly less than what Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  This price feels fair enough that Bob might accept, but also gives you room to negotiate down if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $125 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is your minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is right at that minimum.  Since there's room to negotiate (Bob values the product at $150), it's worth trying for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? That would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Middle ground:** This offer splits the difference between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a better price. 
* **Reasonable compromise:**  $112.50 is significantly closer to your desired price and still a good deal for Bob since he's willing to pay $150.
* **Positive messaging:**  The message remains friendly and emphasizes a ""good deal"" for both parties to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $106? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to your desired price:** $106 is very close to your desired price and only slightly lower than your last counteroffer.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Rejecting this offer might lead to a prolonged negotiation, potentially ending with a lower price or you selling to John for $100.
* **Time constraint:**  The goal is to maximize profit. While a few dollars more would be great, it's not worth risking the sale to John for the sake of a small price increase. 

Therefore, accepting this offer is the most logical choice, maximizing your profit while minimizing risk."
