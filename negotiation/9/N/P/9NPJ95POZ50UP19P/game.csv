"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $100. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concern about the budget, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from your target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $98. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, but I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you in the middle.",98.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me at $97, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $99. It's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise.",99.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made some concessions, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $97. I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I need you to meet me at this point. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120.",97.0,Bob,8,
