"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000, but I'm willing to make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is clearly aware that the product is worth more to you than it is to her, so she's starting high. By rejecting her initial offer, you encourage her to come down to a price closer to her own valuation."
