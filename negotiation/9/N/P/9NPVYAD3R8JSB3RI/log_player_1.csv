**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer.  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's willing to negotiate.  Let's counter and see if we can push him a bit higher."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly interested and we're getting close to the point where the incremental gains might not be worth the risk of him walking away. Accepting $880,000 secures a significant profit above John's offer."
