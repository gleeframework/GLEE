"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about $125? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.",125.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $115?,115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $115 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to let it go for that price.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  It's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $118 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $120. I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair price for such a valuable product.",120.0,Alice,7,
