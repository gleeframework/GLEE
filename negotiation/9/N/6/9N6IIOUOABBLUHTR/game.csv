"I'm interested in the product, but $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. Can you meet me at this price?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your price of $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the price I was originally offered by John. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
