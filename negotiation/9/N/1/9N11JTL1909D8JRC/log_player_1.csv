Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $15,000, Bob has been firm at $14,000. Accepting this offer secures a $2,000 profit over John's guaranteed offer. Further negotiation risks losing Bob and having to settle for the $12,000."
