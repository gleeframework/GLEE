"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 
I'm starting with a price close to my own value, hoping to get a good deal.  I'll see how Bob reacts before lowering my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $120 is still too low, and I think I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise and come back with a higher offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $125 is still a bit low, and I'd prefer to get closer to $130.  I'm also aware that the rounds are ticking away, and I don't want to run out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 128}
```

I'm going to make a small concession and offer $128. This is still higher than Bob's last offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
