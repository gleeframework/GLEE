```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $128, which is just slightly above your desired price.  At this point, with only 5 rounds remaining, it's likely that further negotiation will take too long. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of needing to buy from John for a higher price."
