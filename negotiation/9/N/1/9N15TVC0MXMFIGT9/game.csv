"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product. However, $900000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. Would you be open to discussing that?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can see the value in this product and I'd like to meet you in the middle. Would you be willing to consider $850000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $750000. This would be a good price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $750000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $850000, which would be $800000. I think that's a fair price for this incredible product. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
