Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on it, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $900,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, based on my budget considerations, I am unable to agree to $1,200,000. Could we meet closer to my maximum offer of $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I get the value I need."
