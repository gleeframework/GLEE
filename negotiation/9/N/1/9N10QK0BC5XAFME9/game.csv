"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can find a price that is more reasonable for both of us. I am proposing to purchase the product for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $1,400,000 is significantly below the product's value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm offering to lower my price to $1,600,000. This price still allows for a profit for me while being more within your budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
