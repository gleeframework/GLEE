"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my budget. How about we meet at $950,000? That would be a good middle ground for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still too far below my minimum.  Let's split the difference at $1,000,000. This would give us both a good outcome, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way to $1,000,000. How about we meet at $975,000? That's as high as I'm willing to go, but I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on that price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
