"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's split the difference - I'm happy to pay $95.  What do you say?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
