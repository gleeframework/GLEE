Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you first. I believe it will be very beneficial for you.  I'm willing to let it go for $12,000."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start with a price above Bob's perceived value.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing a price higher than $10,000. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating its value to you (Alice), the message implies the product's worth by mentioning its benefits and your willingness to ""let it go"" at this price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob based on his response."
