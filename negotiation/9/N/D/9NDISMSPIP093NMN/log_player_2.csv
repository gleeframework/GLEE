"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

You can get the product from John for $120, so any price above that is not beneficial for you.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

You're still better off buying from John than accepting Alice's current offer. Rejecting gives you another chance to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a lower price."

This offer is still below what you would pay John, but it's closer to Alice's potential profit, so it could be more appealing to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now lower than John's price, making it the most beneficial option.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of a lower price, and you risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
