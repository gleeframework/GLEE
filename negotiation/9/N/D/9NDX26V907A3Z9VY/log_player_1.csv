Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $15,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price later.
* **Gauging Interest:** This offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you've secured a great deal. If he rejects or tries to negotiate, you know there's room to work with.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, so you can afford to be a bit more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and negotiation tactics."
