Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold strategy, but I believe it's important to set the bar high to see if Bob is truly serious about buying the product. If he rejects, I can always lower the price later. It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy that could yield a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a good price, I'm not willing to settle yet.  I believe I can push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer. This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to continue negotiating,  $920,000 is a very good price. I'm confident this is the best I can get from Bob, and it's a significant profit over selling to John. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
