Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  

I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget with this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. I believe I can get a better price by engaging in further negotiation. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to be flexible but still want to get a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is only $500 less than my initial counteroffer and is a decent price. Since I don't want to risk further negotiation and potential rejection, I'll accept Bob's offer."
