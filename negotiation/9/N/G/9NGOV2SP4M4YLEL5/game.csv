"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $2,300,000 is closer to the true value of this product considering its potential. To find middle ground, I could come down to $2,000,000. This offer stands as a testament to my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $2,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
