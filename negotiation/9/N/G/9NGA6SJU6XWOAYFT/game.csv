"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more from my initial offer, but let's split the difference. I'll accept $8,750. This gives you a significant savings compared to your initial assessment and still allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $7,750. Can you consider this price?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but I can't go any lower than $8,250. That's a fair compromise, and it still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try to close this deal.  What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'll try to find a middle ground. How about $7,800? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can you consider this price?",7800.0,Bob,6,
