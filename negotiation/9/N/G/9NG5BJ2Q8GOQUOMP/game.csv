"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product's value is still underestimated at $950,000. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we agree on $1,050,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
