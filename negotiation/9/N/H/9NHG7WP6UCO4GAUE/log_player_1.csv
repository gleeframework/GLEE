Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer of $950,000 is still significantly below John's standing offer of $1,000,000.  Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him not reaching the $1,000,000 mark, and time is a factor. It's strategically more sound to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
