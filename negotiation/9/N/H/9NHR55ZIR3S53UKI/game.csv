"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000, but I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal started.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $600,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $550,000 for the product. This price still leaves you with a good profit and allows me to achieve my budget goal.",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product at $550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $575,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand.",575000.0,Alice,3,
