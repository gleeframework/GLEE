Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm offering the product for $1,000,000. This is above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000). 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, highlighting the potential benefit for Bob. 
* **Strategy:** This initial offer gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, while still allowing for a potentially profitable sale. If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly with each counteroffer, while still keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the potential deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob. 

* I have a backup option of selling to John for $1,200,000, which gives me leverage. 
*  I'm hoping to find a compromise that is closer to my desired price point."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $900,000. This is a compromise between Bob's offer and my previous offer. 
* **Message:** I'm being polite but firm, emphasizing the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate.  I'm also positioning myself as willing to find a middle ground, suggesting that a deal is still possible. 
* **Strategy:** By lowering my offer, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still staying well above Bob's initial offer, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price point, it's still $350,000 below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 

* I'm not in a rush to sell.  I have a backup option of selling to John for $1,200,000, giving me leverage. 
* I'm hoping to find a compromise that is closer to my desired price point.  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000? It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $925,000. This is a compromise between Bob's offer and my previous offer.  It's a clear signal that I am flexible and willing to meet in the middle.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the compromise and highlighting the potential benefits for both parties.  I'm using positive language and focusing on finding a solution. 
* **Strategy:** By offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer, I'm increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement. However, I'm still staying above Bob's current offer, which provides room for further negotiation if needed.  I'm also keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I've already found a better offer from another seller. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000, but I'm not going any higher. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to walk away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  Although it's tempting to keep negotiating, his statement about finding a better offer from another seller makes it likely he won't budge further.   Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, ensuring a much better return for me."
