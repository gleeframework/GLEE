{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) to leave room for negotiation. This initial offer is likely to be rejected, which will allow me to gauge Bob's interest and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price ($120), it's still lower than what I initially hoped to get. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob.  There's potential to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $115 is the lowest I can go at this time.  Would you be willing to split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $112.50. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal of $130, Bob's offer of $112.5 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120 and represents a fair compromise.  I'm going to accept his offer."
