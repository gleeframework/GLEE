"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $9,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in getting this product.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $10,500? It's a bit above your last offer, but I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",10500.0,Alice,5,
