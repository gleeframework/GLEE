"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a great deal for both of us.  You'll be getting it for well below its value to you, and I'll be making a significant profit.  Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth that much to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $875,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
