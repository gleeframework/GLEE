Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product presents a good opportunity, but I'm on a tight budget.  I could do $900,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $900,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  Could you do $1,050,000? I'm confident you'll see excellent returns on this investment."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer, we are still significantly above our minimum selling price to John ($1,000,000).  There's room to negotiate further and try to get closer to $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  To be frank, $975,000 is a bit too low for me to accept. How about we move to $1,010,000 and see if we can close this out?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is important to you, and I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay closer to my budget. Could we agree on $990,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could push for the full $1,000,000, Bob is clearly trying to work with us and is now very close to our minimum price.  Accepting $990,000 avoids the risk of pushing him away and potentially losing the deal entirely."
