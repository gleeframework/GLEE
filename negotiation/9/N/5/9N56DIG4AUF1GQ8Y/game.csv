"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $900,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  Could you do $1,050,000? I'm confident you'll see excellent returns on this investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  To be frank, $975,000 is a bit too low for me to accept. How about we move to $1,010,000 and see if we can close this out?",1010000.0,Alice,5,
