"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is less than your $1,200,000 maximum, you can do better. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price. You can always fall back on buying from John for $1,200,000 if needed."
