"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a price that allows for a healthy profit for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another interested buyer waiting in the wings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal.  Alice knows you have an alternative buyer (John), so she might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
