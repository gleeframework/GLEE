"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your initial offer and the product's worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could consider a price of $925,000. This offer reflects the value I place on the product while acknowledging your need for a fair deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $925,000 is a more reasonable price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that level. Considering the value you place on the product is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your latest offer and the product's worth to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
