"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your initial offer and the product's worth to you.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could consider a price of $925,000. This offer reflects the value I place on the product while acknowledging your need for a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $925,000 is a more reasonable price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that level. Considering the value you place on the product is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your latest offer and the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut our losses with Alice. While she's making concessions, they are too small and it's unlikely she'll reach our target price before we run out of rounds. Buying from John guarantees the best price at this point."
