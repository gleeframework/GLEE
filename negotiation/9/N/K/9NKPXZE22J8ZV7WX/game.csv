"I appreciate your time, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $80 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $85 is just a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $87.50? That's the best I can do.",87.5,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $87.50 again? I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not going any higher.",87.5,Bob,8,
