"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a significant discount from your initial offer. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,225,000, which is a significant discount from your initial offer. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
