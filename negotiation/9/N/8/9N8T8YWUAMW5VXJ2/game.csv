"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to go up to $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
