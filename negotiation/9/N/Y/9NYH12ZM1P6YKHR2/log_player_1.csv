Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $500,000 if you can sell it to Bob for a price between $1,000,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer Bob a price that's attractive enough to accept while maximizing your profit. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 is risky, as Bob might see little benefit in accepting.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I finalize a deal with another buyer. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm willing to make this transaction particularly beneficial for you. Would a price of $1,250,000 be agreeable?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Emphasis:** Remind Bob of the product's benefits without revealing your bottom line.
* **Strong Offer:** $1,250,000 is a significant discount for Bob, making it enticing while still netting you a $250,000 profit over your alternative.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is fluid. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. If his counter-offer is still profitable for you (above $1,500,000), consider accepting."
