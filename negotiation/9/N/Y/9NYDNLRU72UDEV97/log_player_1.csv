Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $950,000. This is a one-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another buyer."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While John offers $1,000,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly is advantageous.  A slightly lower price might entice Bob while still yielding a significant profit. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer adds pressure on Bob to make a decision and increases the perceived value of the product.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but below John's offer leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a price that's still very beneficial for you (e.g., $925,000)."
