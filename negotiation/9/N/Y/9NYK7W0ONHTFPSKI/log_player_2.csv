"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice first. $200 is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation upwards towards our $150 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $100 is significantly less than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $170? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we can still try to negotiate a little further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving towards a compromise, Alice. How about we settle at $130?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference again, aiming for a price that's beneficial for us while still likely acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  How about we split the difference and agree on $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150

```

Alice has come down to our maximum price. There's no point in rejecting and risking going higher, and it's the same price as John. We'll accept the offer."
