"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $12000, which is a great deal considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice, as she values the product higher than Bob does."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $10500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11500. This still gives you a great price, and gets us closer to making this happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what he'd pay for the product from John.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's still room for a deal that benefits both of them."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $11,500 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price we can both agree on. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, and offer the product for $11250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think it would be a great deal for both of us. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  Alice's offer of $11,250 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and it's likely that further negotiation with Alice will not result in a lower price.  It's better for Bob to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
