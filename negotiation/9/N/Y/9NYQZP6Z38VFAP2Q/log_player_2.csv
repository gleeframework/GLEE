Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly option, Bob. However, I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to you.

While I could try to push Alice further, it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting at $775,000 gets me the product for less than John's price and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
