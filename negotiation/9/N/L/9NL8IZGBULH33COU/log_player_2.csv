"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  You can counteroffer Alice with a lower price and see if she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay closer to my target price. I'd be happy to offer $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to pay closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You should buy the product from John.  Even though Alice is willing to come down to $9,500, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You can get the product from John for $8,000, which is your target price."
