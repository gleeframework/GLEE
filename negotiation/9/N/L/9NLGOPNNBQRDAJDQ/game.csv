"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy from you. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $1 million on this product. I'm confident this is a fair price that would still allow you to make a healthy profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement here.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to suggest a compromise. How about we set the product price at $1,050,000? This allows for a reasonable profit while remaining competitive in the market. I am open to further discussion and adjustments if necessary.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
