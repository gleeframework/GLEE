# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.

You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to suggest a compromise. How about we set the product price at $1,050,000? This allows for a reasonable profit while remaining competitive in the market. I am open to further discussion and adjustments if necessary.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is within Bob's budget and significantly better than John's offer of $1,200,000.  There is still a bit of room to negotiate, but accepting this offer secures the product at a good price, avoiding further negotiation rounds and the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer."
