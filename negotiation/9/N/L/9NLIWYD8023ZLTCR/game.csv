"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Bob. However,  $11,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  To move this forward, I could consider $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
