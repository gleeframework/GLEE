"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its high value and quality, I believe it's worth more than $100. Considering its worth to you is $120, I propose we start at $110. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is better than $120, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $105.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To try to reach an agreement, I would like to suggest a price of $107. This is slightly above your offer but still below my initial asking price. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive:** $107 is significantly lower than Bob's initial maximum of $120, and it's only $2 more than Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to more rounds and potentially a higher price, especially as Alice has already demonstrated a willingness to bargain. 
* **Time constraint:** Each round is a step closer to having to buy from John at $120. 

Therefore, accepting the offer at $107 provides a good deal for Bob while minimizing the risk of a worse outcome."
