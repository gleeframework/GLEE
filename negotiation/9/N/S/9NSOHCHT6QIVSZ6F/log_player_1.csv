Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it allows room for negotiation while still being a significant amount above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm hoping Bob will find the product valuable enough to pay a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm rejecting his offer and will try to counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and my minimum price. I hope this shows my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a fair value for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $10,000 I can get from John. To ensure I get at least my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John."
