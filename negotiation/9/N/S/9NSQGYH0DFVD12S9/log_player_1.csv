Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob automatically rejects your offer.  

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting with a price significantly above Bob's valuation, but still within a potentially negotiable range. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""significant returns"" aims to justify the high price, even if these are somewhat subjective.
* **Exclusivity:**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a touch of urgency and importance.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** This is just your opening offer. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go.
* **Consider Time:** If you're confident in John's offer, you can afford to be more patient with Bob. 

Let me know if you'd like to explore alternative strategies or if Bob comes back with a counter-offer!"
