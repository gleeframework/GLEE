Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position that sets the stage for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit.  I'll be watching Bob's reaction closely and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my ideal price, but I still believe I can get more. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on getting a good price for my product. I believe this price is fair and gives Bob a good opportunity to secure the product without going too far below his initial offer.  We're getting close, and I'm hoping this counteroffer leads to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come down a bit further, and while I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, I'm happy with $920,000.  It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. I'll take the deal!"
