"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but not too far off. This gives me some room to negotiate while still being a reasonable starting point. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to me, which might subtly influence Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I'm hoping we can find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider $12,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell.  Rejecting his offer allows me to potentially get a better price by engaging in further negotiation. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $13,000? It's still a great deal for a product worth so much. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm  countering with $13,000, splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price. The message also emphasizes the ""great deal"" aspect, encouraging Bob to consider the value he's getting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to counter with $12,500 for the product. This is my highest offer, given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and represents a good compromise.  It's more than what John would offer, and the negotiation process is getting lengthy.  Accepting his offer ensures I secure a decent profit and prevents further rounds of back-and-forth."
