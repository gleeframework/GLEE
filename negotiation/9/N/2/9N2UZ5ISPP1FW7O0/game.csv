"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at 130. How about we compromise at 135? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $135. How about we meet at $125? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go down to 125. I'm willing to meet you halfway between 135 and 125. How about we try 130.50? It's a compromise that still gives me a decent profit.",130.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $128. How about we try that?",128.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go down to 128. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we try 131? It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",131.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go down to 129. I think we're getting close, though. How about we meet at 130? It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",130.0,Alice,9,
