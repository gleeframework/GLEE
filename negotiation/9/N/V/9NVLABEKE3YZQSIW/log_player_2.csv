"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget. While it's a good deal compared to the product's true value, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget. Bob can still try to negotiate further and potentially reach a price closer to his maximum limit.  Rejecting allows him to make another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $885,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's ideal price is $800,000, Alice's final offer of $885,000 is still within his budget. Given that Alice has stated this is her lowest price, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a lower price.  Accepting the offer minimizes the risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at his higher price."
