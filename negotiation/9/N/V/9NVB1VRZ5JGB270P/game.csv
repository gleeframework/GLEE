"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to commit up to $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price given my budget constraints. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am still unable to meet the price of $1,050,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
