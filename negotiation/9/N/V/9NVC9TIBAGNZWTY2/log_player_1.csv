Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a decent markup from my minimum value of $150, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm curious to see how Bob values the product and if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum value, I'd like to try and get a little more if possible.  I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  I'm hoping that this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $160 is still a good deal for me, as it exceeds my minimum value of $150.  There's always a chance that Bob might come back with another counteroffer, but I'm not willing to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
