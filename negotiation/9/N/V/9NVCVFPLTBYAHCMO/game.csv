"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $750,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price.

"Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $680,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $700,000.
