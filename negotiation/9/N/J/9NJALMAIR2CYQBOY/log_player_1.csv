Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any concerns."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that's still significantly below Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This increases the likelihood of him accepting while still securing a good profit for me.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation, signaling flexibility and potentially leading to an even higher sale price."
