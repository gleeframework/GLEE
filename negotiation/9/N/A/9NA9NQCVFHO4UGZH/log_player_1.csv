{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $925,000. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (John's offer). 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aim for a price significantly above your minimum but below Bob's maximum. 
* **The Offer:** $925,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for you while still being an attractive offer for Bob, saving him $75,000 compared to his perceived value. 

By starting with a strong offer, you increase the chances of Bob accepting without further negotiation."
