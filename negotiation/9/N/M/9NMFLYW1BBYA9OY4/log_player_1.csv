Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, as I know it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $100, which I believe is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $80 to make selling worthwhile (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $100 gives Bob a good deal (saving him $20) while still netting you a $20 profit over your minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between:

* **Securing the sale:**  A price too close to $120 risks Bob rejecting the offer and going elsewhere.
* **Maximizing your profit:** A price too close to $80 leaves potential profit on the table."
