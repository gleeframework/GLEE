"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know if that works for you!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You've stated that the product is worth at least $80 to you, so $100 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $120, so there's potential for both of you to find a price that works.
* **It's a friendly opening:**  The message is casual and inviting, setting a positive tone for the negotiation.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a decent offer and closer to your minimum, there's still potential to get a better price.  Bob clearly values the product at more than $90, as he's willing to negotiate.  By rejecting his offer, you can explore a counteroffer that gets you closer to your ideal price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 doesn't quite work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise while still maintaining a price point that's reasonable for you.
* **Fairness:**  By suggesting to ""split the difference"", you're framing the price as a fair compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Enthusiasm:**  The message is positive and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $85 is close to your minimum, it's still worth trying to squeeze out a bit more.  You've already rejected his previous offer, and he's clearly interested in the product.  By rejecting this offer, you can make another counteroffer that might bring him closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I get that you're looking for a good deal, but $85 simply won't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be at least $90 to make this work.  Let's keep negotiating and see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** This message reaffirms your minimum price while still acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price.
* **Focus on compromise:**  The message emphasizes finding a ""middle ground"" to encourage further negotiation.
* **Maintains a positive tone:**  The message avoids accusatory language and keeps the conversation civil."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $87.50 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $87.50 is very close to your minimum of $80.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.
* **Potential for John:**  If you reject this offer and continue negotiating, there's a chance you won't reach a deal with Bob, forcing you to sell to John at $80. 

Taking Bob's offer ensures you get a higher price than selling to John, even if it's only slightly above your minimum."
