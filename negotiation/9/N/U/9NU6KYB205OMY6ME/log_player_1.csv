"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer the product for $11,500? This gives you a good deal and allows me to recover some of my costs."", ""product_price"": 11500}
