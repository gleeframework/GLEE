"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'll sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's not even close to my valuation. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but that price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I believe it's a fair price, considering my valuation and the fact that I'm a serious buyer."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer, significantly below Alice's initial price, but still above my maximum budget. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping that Alice will see the value in moving closer to my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'll sell it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a reduction from her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $8,000. I'm not comfortable accepting it at this point. I'll reject her offer and counter again, hoping to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise considering our valuations.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer by $500, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but still staying within my budget. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing to Alice as it's a significant move from my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll sell it to you for $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. While it's a significant drop from her initial price, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk further negotiation that might push the price back up. I'm comfortable buying from John for $8,000, which is a guaranteed price and within my budget."
