"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm intrigued by the product, your initial price is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay up to $1000000 for it, as I'm sure it has value, but I'm not comfortable going above that.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating at that price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is a significant amount, it unfortunately falls short of the value I place on this product. I'm willing to compromise, however, and offer a counteroffer of $1250000. This price reflects the unique potential of this product, while acknowledging your financial considerations. I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our goals.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. Given my budget constraints, I can't go above $1000000.  I'm confident this product has value, and I'm very interested in acquiring it, but I need to stay within that price point.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
