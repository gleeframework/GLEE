Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm intrigued by the product, your initial price is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay up to $1000000 for it, as I'm sure it has value, but I'm not comfortable going above that.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
