"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $8,875 for the product.
