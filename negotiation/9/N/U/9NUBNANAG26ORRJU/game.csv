"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I would like to propose an alternative.

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit away from the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer at $12500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the purchase.",12500.0,Bob,4,
