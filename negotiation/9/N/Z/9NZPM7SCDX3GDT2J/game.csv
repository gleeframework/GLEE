"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. I think that's a fair price for this valuable product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you do $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go much lower than $14,000. However, I'm willing to make a compromise at $13,000. I think that's a fair price for the value this product brings.",13000.0,Alice,5,
