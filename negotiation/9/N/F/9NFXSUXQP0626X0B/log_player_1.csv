Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point. It's higher than his perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit.  

I'm also keeping in mind John's offer of $1,200,000, so I won't settle for anything too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still lower than what I want to earn. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with $950,000. This is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer, and it demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate while still securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my ideal price. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a deadlock. I'd rather secure the sale at a decent profit than risk getting nothing at all if Bob walks away."
