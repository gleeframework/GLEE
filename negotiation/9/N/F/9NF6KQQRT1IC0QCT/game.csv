"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it could be incredibly valuable to you as well. To start, I'm asking for $1500000 for it. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us, so let's talk!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $900000 is below my minimum threshold, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1200000? This still leaves room for you to profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a lower offer. How about we meet at $950000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
