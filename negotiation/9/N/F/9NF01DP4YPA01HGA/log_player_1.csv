"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still significantly exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I believe this is a strong starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get more.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $9,500? That's a fair price, considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $9,250 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price, and I'm willing to keep negotiating for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,250 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,375?  I think this is a fair compromise that will leave us both happy."", ""product_price"": 9375}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about $9,200? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below what I'd ideally like, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  With only four rounds left, I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to settle for John's lower offer.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
