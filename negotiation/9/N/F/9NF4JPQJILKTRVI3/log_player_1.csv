Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$14,000 is a good starting point.** It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and positive.** It highlights the value for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **It's important to remember my fallback option with John.** If Bob rejects, I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I won't settle for anything significantly lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $15,000.** I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer.**  I can try to bridge the gap a bit more. 
* **I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000.** This provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $12,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,250? This way, we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Offering $13,250:** It's a slight increase from Bob's offer, but still significantly lower than my minimum.
* **Positive messaging:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes a fair deal for both parties. 

I believe this counteroffer will push Bob closer to my desired price point while still keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum.**  While $13,000 is still less than my ideal price of $15,000, it's only $2,000 less.
* **The risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will budge further, and I risk losing him completely.
* **Selling to John:** While John offers a higher price, I'm not certain if he's a reliable buyer, and I don't want to risk losing a deal entirely.

**In this scenario, it's strategically better to accept Bob's offer. It's a decent price, and it avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation that could lead to no deal at all.**"
