"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe the product is a great fit for my business, but I have to stay within a budget. I'm willing to make a significant investment, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my company. Can you consider my counteroffer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
