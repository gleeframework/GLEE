{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John.
* **Maximizing Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible without pushing Bob away.
* **The Offer:** $925,000 leaves a significant profit margin for Bob ($75,000) while securing a substantial gain for you ( $125,000 over your guarantee). 

This strategy balances risk and reward. It's possible Bob could try to negotiate a lower price, but starting high provides room for potential negotiation while still aiming for a maximized profit."
