"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a fair price:**  While it's below Bob's perceived value, it's also above my minimum acceptable price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for back-and-forth without me having to drastically lower my price.
* **It shows good faith:**  I'm starting the negotiation with a reasonable offer and demonstrating my willingness to work with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for now, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial asking.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below what I'm hoping for. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can still get a better deal.  It's better to keep negotiating with Bob than to sell to John right now, as John is offering the absolute minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $8,800 just isn't quite there for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,100. That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Bob's counteroffer is only $500 above John's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, the risk of continuing the negotiation is too high. There's a chance Bob will continue to lower his offer, and I may end up with an even worse deal than John's. It's more prudent to secure the guaranteed $8,000 from John at this point."
