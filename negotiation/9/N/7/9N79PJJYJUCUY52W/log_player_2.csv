"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $100 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Bob is serious about buying but also wants a lower price. $85 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  How does that sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but $95 is still a bit too high. Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $90.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while showing Bob is willing to compromise. Offering $90 shows a commitment to buying while remaining within Bob's budget."
