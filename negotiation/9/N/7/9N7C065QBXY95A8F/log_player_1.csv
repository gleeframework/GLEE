Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value but still gives you a good profit. This strategy is designed to:

* **Start high:**  It's best to start with a price that is closer to your desired profit margin, giving you room to negotiate.
* **Show confidence:** A bold opening price shows that you value your product.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth, potentially leading to a higher final price.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your earnings while keeping in mind the potential for John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. I think it's a bit pricey, but I'm interested in it. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your desired profit margin.  You have room for negotiation and can likely get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially get closer to your desired $14,000.  The risk of selling to John is always there, but for now, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $12,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Splits the difference:** This approach signals willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Provides a clear rationale:**  It emphasizes the value of the product and the fairness of the proposed price.
* **Keeps the negotiations moving:** It encourages Bob to respond and potentially reach an agreement.

By making this counteroffer, you continue to pursue a higher price while acknowledging Bob's position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $13,250. Would you be willing to go down to $12,750? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,750 is closer to your desired price, it's still not ideal. You're better off continuing to negotiate with Bob and aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer gives you the opportunity to make one more counteroffer.  If you can't reach a mutually acceptable price, then you can consider selling to John.  But for now, it's worth exploring if you can get closer to your desired $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000. I'm willing to make this final concession to finalize the deal. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my desired range. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows a willingness to compromise:** You're meeting Bob halfway, demonstrating your commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Frames it as a final offer:** This puts pressure on Bob to respond and potentially accept.
* **Emphasizes the fairness of the price:** It highlights the benefits for both parties.

At this point, you're making a significant concession, but it's still a good profit for you. If Bob rejects this final counteroffer, you have the option of selling to John, but it's worth giving him one last chance to close the deal."
