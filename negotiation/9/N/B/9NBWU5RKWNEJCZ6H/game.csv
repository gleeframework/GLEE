"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of the product's value. While I understand your budget constraints, I am unable to match the $750,000 offer. I am willing to negotiate further, so I propose an offer of $850,000 for the product. This still allows us to work within a reasonable margin while ensuring fair compensation for the value provided. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for.",850000.0,Alice,3,
