Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $11,000, and that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $11,000.  You can get the product for your target price from John, so it's time to switch sellers."
