"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and your interest, I propose a price of $9,500 for it. This is a special offer considering its worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  He's willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice values the product at $10,000. There's room for both to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Considering your value for the product and my maximum budget, I propose $8,500. This price allows both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our previous discussion and aiming for mutual benefit, I propose a price of $9,000 for the product. This offers a compromise between our respective positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, the offer of $9,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price of $8,000. Bob can likely negotiate a lower price, especially considering Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise. He still has time to counteroffer before deciding to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. I propose $8,750 as a compromise.  This price reflects both the value you place on the product and my ability to make a purchase.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. In order to move forward, I propose a price of $8,900 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product while allowing for a reasonable deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $8,900 is still a bit higher than Bob's budget.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob has several rounds left to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure the product for a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm feeling like we're very close to a deal. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $8,800. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget.  Let's finalize this and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8800}
