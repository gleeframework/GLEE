"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many of our previous customers. I believe it could be a great addition to your collection. Let's start with a price of $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$100 is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal.** You're willing to spend up to $150, so there's room for negotiation.
* **You have 10 rounds to work with.** This gives you time to explore different offers and potentially get a lower price. 
* **Rejecting the offer lets you see if Alice is willing to come down in price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about your product. However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm interested in buying, but I'd like to offer $75. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower the price significantly:**  A $25 drop from $100 shows you're serious about negotiating.
* **Stay within your budget:**  $75 leaves room for Alice to counter and still be within your $150 limit.
* **Provide a reason for your offer:**  Mentioning your budget and showing interest in the product keeps the negotiation friendly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and am willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $90 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price.** While $90 is a compromise, you're aiming for a lower price.
* **You're still within your 10 rounds.**  This gives you more time to negotiate and try to reach a price closer to your target.
* **Rejecting the offer gives you leverage to counter with a lower price.** You can try to bridge the gap between $75 and $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to my target, but $90 is still a bit high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'd like to offer $80. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show continued interest but be firm on your price.**  You're acknowledging Alice's compromise, but you're also staying within your budget and negotiating.
* **Focus on a compromise:**  Offering $80 is a smaller gap than before, and you're showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  The message is friendly and focused on finding a mutually beneficial solution."
