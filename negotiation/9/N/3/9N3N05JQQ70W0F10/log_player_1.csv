Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point, as it gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I am not willing to accept it. I'll counteroffer him with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise, but it still allows me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price.  I'll take it."
