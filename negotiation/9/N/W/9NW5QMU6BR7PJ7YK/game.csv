"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and my own budget. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to consider $13,000 as a reasonable price for the product. However, I would like to suggest a compromise at $13,500. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle while still ensuring a fair profit for me. I look forward to your response.",13500.0,Alice,3,
