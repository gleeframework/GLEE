"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is less than John's price, it's still above Alice's minimum.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,350,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's potential, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we settle at $1,275,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is lower than John's price.** This means buying from Alice is still more financially beneficial than buying from John.
* **There's room for further negotiation.**  While Alice's offer is close to Bob's counteroffer, it's still above her minimum value. Bob could try to negotiate further, but the risk is that Alice might walk away. 
* **Accepting minimizes risk.**  Accepting the offer guarantees Bob gets the product for a price he's comfortable with, while avoiding the uncertainty of further negotiation and the possibility of having to buy from John at a higher price."
