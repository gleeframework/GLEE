Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe the product has great potential, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to propose a price of $1,075,000. This is a bit closer to your original offer, but still within my budget. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.

While we could push for a bit more, accepting $1,075,000 is a strong deal. It exceeds our minimum acceptable price and represents a significant profit over John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away entirely."
