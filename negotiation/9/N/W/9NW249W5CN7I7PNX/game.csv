"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe the product has great potential, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,050,000 is too low. How about we settle on $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to propose a price of $1,075,000. This is a bit closer to your original offer, but still within my budget. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
