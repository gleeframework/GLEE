"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1750000. I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a good strategy to potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you've outlined.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth a lot to me, and I believe a price closer to $1600000 would be more fair.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above your maximum budget, but closer to it. It's still worth negotiating further to see if you can get the price down even more. You have 7 rounds remaining, which gives you ample time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you've outlined and the fact that you're willing to negotiate.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
