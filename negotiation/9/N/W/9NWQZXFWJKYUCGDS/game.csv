"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1750000. I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you've outlined.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth a lot to me, and I believe a price closer to $1600000 would be more fair.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $1600000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1400000.  This is a fair price considering the value you've outlined and the fact that you're willing to negotiate.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
