Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit.

Let's see if we can squeeze out a little more.  I'm not sure we're quite there yet."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $98.75. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $99.50?

This is a good deal for me. It's below my maximum, and I'm not sure I can get Alice to go lower."
