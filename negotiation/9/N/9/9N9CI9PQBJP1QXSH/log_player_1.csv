Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I want to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but I also want to make sure Bob finds the offer appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below my minimum allows for potential counter-offers from Bob if he tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** My message subtly emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.

By starting high but still offering a price that's beneficial for Bob compared to him rejecting the offer, I increase my chances of a successful sale at a price that nets me a significant profit."
