"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $1,200,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's too early to accept Bob's offer, as it is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's meet halfway on this, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $1,100,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't go below my minimum price. I will counteroffer and try to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not able to go as low as $1,100,000. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $1,350,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. Let's finalize this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum desired price. I've only got a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price than John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
