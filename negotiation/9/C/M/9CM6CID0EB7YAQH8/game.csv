"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to miss. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $1,200,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's meet halfway on this, what do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $1,100,000. Can you consider that?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not able to go as low as $1,100,000. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $1,350,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. Let's finalize this deal, what do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
