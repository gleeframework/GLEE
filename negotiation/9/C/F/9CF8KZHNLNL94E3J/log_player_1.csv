Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  $115 is more than what Bob values the product at ($100), but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $115 is still above your minimum acceptable price ($120), meaning you're still making a profit. 

Let's see if Bob takes the bait!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is too low.  While it's tempting to accept, remember that John is willing to pay $120. There's more room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  You're willing to come down from your original offer, showing Bob you're open to a deal.
* **Still above your minimum:** $110 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring you're not losing money.
* **Leaves room for more negotiation:** It gives Bob some wiggle room, encouraging him to come up in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is getting closer to your minimum, you still have a better option.  John is willing to pay $120, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer.  It's worth pushing a little further with Bob, as you might be able to reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $105 is still a little too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $112? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make this worthwhile. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 112}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Maintains your position:** You're not budging too much, showing Bob you're serious about getting a fair price.
* **Offers a small increase:** You're only asking for a $7 increase, making it a more palatable option for Bob.
* **Leaves room for a final compromise:** There's still space for negotiation, but you're getting closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $108, but no more than that. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's time to cut your losses and sell to John.  While you were hoping for a better price from Bob, he's not willing to meet you halfway.  John is offering a significantly higher price, making him the better option.  You're still making a profit and getting a good price, so it's time to move on."
