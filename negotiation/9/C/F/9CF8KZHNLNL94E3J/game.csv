"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $105 is still a little too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $112? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make this worthwhile. Let me know what you think.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $108, but no more than that. Can you meet me there?",108.0,Bob,6,
