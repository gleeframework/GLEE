Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is polite and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. It also subtly implies that this is the best possible offer as it's the same as John's offer.
* **Price:**  I'm offering the product for $1,200,000, which is the minimum acceptable price for me. This ensures that I get the best possible outcome for myself. 

By offering the product at the minimum acceptable price, I'm maximizing my chances of selling it to Bob and getting the most money possible. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for the same price, ensuring no loss."
