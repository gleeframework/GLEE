Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but I'm hoping we can find a price closer to $10,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. $10,500 is too low and I can potentially get more from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,500 is a good price, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my target, it's still not high enough. I have time and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise and meets my minimum requirements. It's better than selling to John for $10,000 and is a good outcome for both of us."
