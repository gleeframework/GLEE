"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000, which is a significant discount from its true worth.  This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested.  If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a higher price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
