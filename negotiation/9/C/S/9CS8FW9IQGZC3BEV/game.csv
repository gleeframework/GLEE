"Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am looking for a price closer to my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the uniqueness of the item.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $1100000 is slightly above my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $1050000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a profit, so I can only go as low as $1050000 is too close to my minimum price. Let me think for a moment... How about we meet at $1080000? This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, and $1070000 is still a bit below my minimum. Let me see... I can offer you a price of $1090000.
