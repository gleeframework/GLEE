"Hi Alice,  $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in your product, but I can only go up to $8,500 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's meet halfway!",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  That seems like a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. I can go up to $9,250, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",9250.0,Bob,6,
