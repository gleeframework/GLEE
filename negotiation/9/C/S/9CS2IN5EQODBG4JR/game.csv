"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $150 is my ideal price, I could meet you halfway at $115. This offer reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $115 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $92.50. That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  I understand you're on a budget, but this product is worth every penny. How about we split the difference again and call it $103.75? That's my final offer.",103.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I really think $103.75 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think I might need to look elsewhere for this product.",95.0,Bob,6,
