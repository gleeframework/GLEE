"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $12,000.
* Alice is offering the product for $11,500.
* You can get the product from John for $12,000.

Since Alice's offer is better than John's offer, but not better than your maximum price, you should reject Alice's offer. You can try to negotiate further with Alice or purchase the product from John."
