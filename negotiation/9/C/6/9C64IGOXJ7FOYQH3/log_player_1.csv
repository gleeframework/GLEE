Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $10,500, I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $11,500."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750.
