"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, at $1,200,000, knowing Bob's maximum is $800,000. This sets the stage for a negotiation.  I'll be prepared to lower my price if needed, but I want to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I understand the product's value, but I'm only comfortable paying $850,000 at this time. It's a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept just yet.  I need to see how much Bob is willing to budge, and I have John as a backup.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it's a price that I believe is fair, considering the value you've stated. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm reducing my price to $1,050,000, which is still a considerable profit for me. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell.  We're getting closer to a potential deal, but I'm not ready to give up too much yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for this product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's work towards a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to accept. I'm confident I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.  John is still a viable option if we can't reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  However, $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and it reflects my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's close this deal, but we need to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm keeping it above my minimum, showing Bob that I'm serious about negotiating but also that I have a limit. I'm hoping to get a final offer from Bob in the next round.  If not, I'm confident John will buy the product at $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still working within my budget.  I can offer $925,000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value I see in your product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer for $925,000.  While it's still below my initial goal, it's a decent profit and a better price than John's offer.  The negotiation is getting tense, and there's a risk Bob will walk away if I reject his offer.  I'm confident I can make a better deal with John in the future, and I don't want to lose this opportunity with Bob."
