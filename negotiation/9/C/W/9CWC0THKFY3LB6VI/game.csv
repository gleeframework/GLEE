"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1600000. This is a fair price considering the product's rarity and uniqueness. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're still looking to get closer to the product's true value, but I'm not willing to go above $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original counteroffer, so I'm proposing a price of $1300000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you've described, and I'm willing to make a deal happen at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $1600000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you a price of $1550000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.
