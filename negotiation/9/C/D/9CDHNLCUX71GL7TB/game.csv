"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $82 is closer, I'm still a little over budget. How about we split the difference and I pay $81? I'm really keen on getting this product.",81.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really keen on getting the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $81. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82 and $81, so I'm offering the product to you for $80.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",80.5,Alice,5,
