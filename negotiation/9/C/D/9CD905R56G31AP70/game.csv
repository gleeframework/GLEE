"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is more than fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. After reviewing the product's features and potential, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This price reflects the value I believe the product has, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1,275,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I believe the product has, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this simple - $1,300,000 and we have a deal. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer. I'm thinking $1,250,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to explore other options.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
