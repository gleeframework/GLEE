Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $130."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning any price below this represents a potential gain for him.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $80 from John, so any offer to Bob should exceed this to be worthwhile.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a higher price ($130) leaves room for negotiation.  Bob might accept immediately, netting you a great profit.
* **Potential Counter:**  Even if Bob counters, there's space to negotiate down towards $90-$100, which is still significantly more than your fallback option. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
