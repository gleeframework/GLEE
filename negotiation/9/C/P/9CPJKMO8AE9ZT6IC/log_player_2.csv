{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100. It makes sense to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the maximum price I'm willing to pay. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping Alice will be motivated to sell quickly."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get it down to $100 or at least closer.  John is always a safe option, but I'm aiming to save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm also aware that John is a reliable alternative, but I'm determined to get the best possible deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. It's a compromise, but I'm still confident that I can get the price down further. We're getting closer to a deal, and I want to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product. If this offer is rejected, I'll consider buying from John, but I'll still try to get a better deal from Alice in the remaining rounds."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still determined to get a better deal. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price of $100. It's important to note that John is always an option, but I'm hoping to secure the product for less by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise.  $115 is still a good deal for me, and I'm hopeful Alice will see that we're close to an agreement. With only a few rounds left, I need to find a balance between getting a good price and ensuring we close a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is our last chance to make a deal with Alice.  $122 is a bit higher than my preferred price, but it's within my budget and a good compromise.  It's more than I would have liked, but given the circumstances, I'd rather buy from Alice than risk losing the opportunity and having to purchase from John at a higher price."
