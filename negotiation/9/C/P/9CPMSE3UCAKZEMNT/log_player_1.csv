"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a significant premium over my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested in buying at a high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get a higher price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm offering $13,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. I'm hoping this price will be acceptable to him, and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still want to see if I can get a bit more.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to offer $12,000.  I'm getting close to my minimum, and I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal with Bob. If he rejects, I may have to start considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to my minimum.  However, with only four rounds left, I don't have much leverage to push for a higher price.  I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, he might get stubborn and the negotiations could fall apart.  It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk losing the deal altogether."
