"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This allows for potential negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which still leaves some room for profit for both of us. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 
 
I'm lowering my price slightly, but staying above my minimum. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle on $110? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$110 is still below my minimum. While I appreciate Bob's willingness to compromise, I'm not willing to sell below my floor price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $110 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob,  offering $115 which is still slightly above my minimum but shows flexibility and willingness to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to go up to $112.50, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, Bob's offer is still below it.  Given the time constraint and the certainty of selling to John for $150, I'll take the safe route and sell to John."
