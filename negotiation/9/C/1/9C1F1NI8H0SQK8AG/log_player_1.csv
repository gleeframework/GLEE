Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum and I'd rather close the deal than risk losing the sale to John or going through more rounds of negotiation."
