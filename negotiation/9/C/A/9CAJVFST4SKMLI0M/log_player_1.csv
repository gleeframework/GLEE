Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims to maximize profit but has the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. You know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's a chance he might find the $1,500,000 price excessive.  You'll need to weigh the potential for higher profit against the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
