{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always best to try and negotiate a better price.  While $1,200,000 is less than John's price, there's room for Alice to come down further. We'll see if we can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price close to Alice's valuation. This shows we're serious about buying but are also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high. We're getting closer to a deal, but I'm confident we can get a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're increasing our offer, showing Alice we're willing to meet her halfway. This price is still significantly less than what we'd pay John, so we're leaving room for negotiation while also showing a willingness to compromise."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, she's still too high. I'm not going to pay more than $1,200,000 at this point. We'll see if we can close the gap in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to a deal. This counteroffer is just below the middle ground between our last offer and Alice's. It shows a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for Alice to make a concession if she wants to close the deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high. We're running out of time, but I'm still confident we can get a better price. We've shown our willingness to compromise, and she needs to do the same."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're going to be aggressive with this offer.  We're only two rounds away from having to go with John, so we need to push Alice to make a decision. This price is still below her offer, but it's closer to what she needs to be happy with. Hopefully, this will force a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough spot.  Alice is holding firm at $1,500,000, and we have only one round left.  We've already shown we're willing to negotiate, but Alice is clearly not willing to budge further.  There's no point in making another counteroffer because we're very likely to end up with the same result -  having to buy from John at $1,500,000.  So, it's best to cut our losses and buy from John now. It's not the ideal price, but it ensures we get the product without risking further negotiation that may end in failure."
