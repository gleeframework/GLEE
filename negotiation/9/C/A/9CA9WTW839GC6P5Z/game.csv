"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. Is that something you'd be interested in?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet, Bob. I can do $105, but that's as high as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Okay, Alice, you're a tough negotiator!  How about $98 and we call it a deal? I'm serious about buying the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, Bob. I can do $110, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. How about $108?",108.0,Alice,7,
