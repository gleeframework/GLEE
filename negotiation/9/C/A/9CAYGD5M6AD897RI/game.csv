I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think it's a fantastic deal for you at a price of $150. What do you think?,150.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a great price for a fantastic product like this!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  It's a fair price, and I think we can both be happy with that.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we compromise at $115? It's a great price that I think we can both be happy with.",115.0,Alice,5,
