"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1500000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I'm seeking, I'm willing to pay $1000000. This is my top offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is my final offer. If you're not interested at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
