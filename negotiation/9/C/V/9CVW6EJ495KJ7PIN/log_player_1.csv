Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still confident I can do better. I'm not willing to settle for just a little bit more than what John is offering. There's still some room for negotiation with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your continued interest. I'm willing to come down to $1,320,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,260,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not enough. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and there's a real risk that I'll end up with less than what John is offering. To avoid this, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
