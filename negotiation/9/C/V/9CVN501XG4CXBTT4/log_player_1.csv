Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale! I'm asking $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's common in negotiation to start with a higher price than you expect to receive. This gives you room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** $100 is a reasonable starting point, giving Bob some wiggle room to counter if they feel it's too high. 
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate, but I also have John as a backup option, ensuring I don't sell for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I'm aiming for at least $95, so Bob's offer is still below my target. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's room to negotiate further. Bob is clearly interested, and I can likely get closer to my target price.
* **No Immediate Need:** Selling to John for $80 is an option, but it's not ideal.  I can afford to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Okay Bob, I appreciate your offer.  How about we split the difference? $95 for the product, and it's yours. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer shows a willingness to compromise, while still being closer to my target price.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and avoids unnecessary fluff.
* **Finality:**  By suggesting ""it's yours,"" I'm implying this is my final offer, adding some urgency.
* **Alternative Remains:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John, but I'm hoping to get a better price through continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $92 is only $3 away from my target price of $95. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob getting frustrated and walking away completely. 
* **No Guarantee of Improvement:**  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer if I reject.  
* **Time is Money:** It's better to accept a good offer and move on than risk losing time and potentially getting a worse price."
