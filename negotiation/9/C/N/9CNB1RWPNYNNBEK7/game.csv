"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a significant discount from the original price. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product, but $950,000 is still above what I can comfortably spend. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $750,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $812,500.  This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",812500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $812,500. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This is a bit above my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $920,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and we can close the deal. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, but I'm not going any higher than that. This is a good compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price. What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit high. Let's split the difference one last time and go with $862,500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it would be the best option for me. This is my final offer.",862500.0,Bob,10,
