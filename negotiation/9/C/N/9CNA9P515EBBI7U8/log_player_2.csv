"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can try to get a lower price from Alice.  $110 is still a bit more than your maximum."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $112.50. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You are still closer to your $120 limit with John, and Alice is unlikely to go lower than $110 as that's her own value of the product. You can try a counteroffer to see if you can nudge the price closer to your goal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $113. Let's meet somewhere in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $113. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $113
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $113, and you are at your limit of $120 with John. It's better to buy from John to avoid further negotiation and potential price increases."
