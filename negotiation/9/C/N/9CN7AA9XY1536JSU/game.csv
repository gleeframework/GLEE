"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than $10000.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  That's still a great deal for you considering the value to you.  Let's make this happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again?  Let's try $10500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $9750.  This is a fair price that's closer to your offer, but still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal!",9750.0,Alice,7,
