"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential,  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 is below its worth.  I could consider parting with it for $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. It's a fair price that recognizes the product's value, and I'm ready to close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
