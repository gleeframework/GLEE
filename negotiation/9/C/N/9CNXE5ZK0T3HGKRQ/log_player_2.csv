Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential,  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 is below its worth.  I could consider parting with it for $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm close to a price I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get her down a little further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. It's a fair price that recognizes the product's value, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
