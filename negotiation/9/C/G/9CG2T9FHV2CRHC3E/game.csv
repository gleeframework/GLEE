"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $160? That seems like a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $160, which would be $142.50. Would you be willing to accept that price?",142.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $142.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $146.25?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",146.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $146.25. I'm willing to go up to $145, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",145.0,Bob,6,
