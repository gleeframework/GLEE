,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $700,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle at $850,000? This price reflects the value you place on the product and allows me to continue making a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $725,000? I think this price is fair and reasonable for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $725,000 is still below what I need, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle on $775,000.

Let me know what you think.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I understand that we're both pushing our limits here.  Considering our time constraints, I'm willing to make a final concession. If you can increase your offer to $800,000, we can close this deal now. This price would allow me to move forward, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value this product offers you. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,7,
