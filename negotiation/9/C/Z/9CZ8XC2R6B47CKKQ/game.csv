"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  $13,500 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob. However, $13,500 is already a very competitive price for this product considering its value.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the willingness to compromise, Alice.  $12,250 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to pay $11,500 if we can agree on that. It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll get this deal done.",11500.0,Bob,4,
