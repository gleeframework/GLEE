```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer by a smaller amount this time, signaling a willingness to reach a compromise.
* **Framing:**  I'm emphasizing fairness and a desire to ""get the deal done,""  adding a sense of urgency to the negotiation.
* **Reiteration of Value:**  The message reinforces my belief that the offer is fair, even if Alice doesn't agree with the exact price yet."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be fair to myself as well.  How about $11,900?  This is my final offer, and I think it reflects the true value of the product.
