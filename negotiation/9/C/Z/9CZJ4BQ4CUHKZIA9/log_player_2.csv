"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire an item valued at $15,000 for a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  He's willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $8,000, so there's room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. How about $10,000? That's still a great price for you, and a good deal for me."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I need to maintain a certain margin for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. At $11,000, Bob is getting a decent deal and saving $4,000 compared to buying from John. While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might reject further offers and he'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
