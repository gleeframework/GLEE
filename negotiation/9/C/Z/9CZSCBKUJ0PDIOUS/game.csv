"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value your offer, $1200000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1275000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1275000 is still below my bottom line.  I'm willing to go down to $1300000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing that we're both trying to find common ground here.  While I appreciate your persistence, $1250000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you at $1280000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  What are your thoughts?",1280000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm afraid $1280000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, which is my final offer. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
