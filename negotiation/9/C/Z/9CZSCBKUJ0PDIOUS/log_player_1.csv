"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for a price of $1,500,000. I believe its value far exceeds this price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum desired value of $1,000,000.  I'm confident that I can push for a higher price in the next round.  Selling to John would only net me the minimum, so I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value your offer, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1275000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, $1,275,000 is still below my minimum value. I have 6 rounds left, so I'm going to push for a higher price.  Selling to John would only give me the minimum, so I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,275,000 is still below my bottom line.  I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it is still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. We have only 4 rounds left, so it's a risky move to sell to John now. I will try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing that we're both trying to find common ground here.  While I appreciate your persistence, $1,250,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you at $1,280,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1280000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but I'm afraid $1280000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, which is my final offer. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We have only two rounds left and Bob has stated that $1,250,000 is his final offer.  There is a high risk that he will walk away if I reject his offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  While I would prefer to get a higher price, selling to John for $1,000,000 is still better than losing the deal and getting nothing."
