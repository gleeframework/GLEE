"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $125. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, but I think it's a bit high. Can you consider it?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $130. Let's meet in the middle on this, I think it's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm making a new counteroffer of $127.50. Can you consider it?",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $127.50 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $132.50 as a final compromise.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",132.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm making a new counteroffer of $126.25. Can you consider it?",126.25,Bob,6,
