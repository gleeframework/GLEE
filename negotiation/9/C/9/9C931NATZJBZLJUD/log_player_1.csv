Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $2,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation significantly higher to explore Bob's maximum willingness to pay. 
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning other interested parties and framing it as a limited-time offer, you create a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he doesn't act quickly. 
* **Justification:** While you don't explicitly justify the high price, the tone implies the product's value and desirability.

**Important Note:** This is a bold opening move. There's a chance Bob might reject it outright. However, it gives you the most room for negotiation and potential to maximize your profit. If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can always negotiate down, knowing your safety net is John's offer."
