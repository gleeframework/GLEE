"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer of $140 is above Bob's maximum price of $120.  Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible while still securing the product. Offering $110 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $140, and it's still within Bob's budget. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while also putting pressure on Alice to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $115 is within Bob's budget and only $5 more than his initial counteroffer.  While Bob would ideally pay less, accepting this offer is a good compromise. It allows Bob to buy the product without exceeding his maximum price and also avoids further negotiation that could lead to a stalemate or a decision to buy from John at a higher price."
