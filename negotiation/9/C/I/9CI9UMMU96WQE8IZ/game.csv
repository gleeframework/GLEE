"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-end item. I believe it's worth a lot to you, but I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in this product but would only be able to offer $9000 at this point. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $10500. This is a fair price for the product, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10500 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm prepared to go up to $10000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $10000. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,5,
