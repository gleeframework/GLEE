"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-end item. I believe it's worth a lot to you, but I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're only willing to pay $10,000, so accepting her offer would be a bad deal.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  By rejecting, you can start a counter-offer process and hopefully bring the price down.
* **Buying from John is always an option.** You can always switch to John if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in this product but would only be able to offer $9,000 at this point. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $10500. This is a fair price for the product, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to your budget, it's still $500 above your maximum price.
* **Rejecting and counter-offering is still the best option.** There's still room for negotiation, and you might be able to get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is a safer option.**  If the negotiation fails, you can always secure the product from John for your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,500 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm prepared to go up to $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $10000. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  Even though she's trying to be flexible, $11,000 is still above your maximum budget.
* **The negotiation is starting to drag.**  Continuing to counteroffer could lead to more rounds and a stalemate.
* **Buying from John is the safest and most efficient choice.** You can get the product for your target price and avoid further negotiations.  

By buying from John, you secure the product at your desired price and avoid risking further rounds with Alice that might not lead to a successful deal."
