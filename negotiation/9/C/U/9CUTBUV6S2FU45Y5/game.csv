"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1300000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1500000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product, which still provides a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1250000, which is still a significant discount from the original price, but closer to the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1250000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we've both discussed, and I'm confident it would be mutually beneficial. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm willing to consider a price of $1225000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value you place on the product, but also acknowledges the initial price we discussed. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1225000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1200000. This would be a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also ensuring a profitable deal for you. Let's close this out and finalize the sale.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
