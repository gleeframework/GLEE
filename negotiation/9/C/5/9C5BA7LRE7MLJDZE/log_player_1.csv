"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a valuable asset to you, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Confidence and Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value to Bob. This could make him more inclined to negotiate. 
* **Openness:** I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, making it clear that I'm open to discussion. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's $1,000,000 offer in mind throughout the negotiation. If the deal with Bob starts to look unlikely, I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  My goal is to maximize profit, so I'll be flexible but won't be afraid to walk away if Bob's offers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the product is worth less than $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. 
* **John's Offer:** While $1,000,000 from John is appealing, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm going to try to push Bob higher. My initial offer was likely too aggressive, and Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  I'll aim for something like $1,050,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,050,000. This gives us both a good deal, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing this as a fair deal that benefits both of us. 
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a bit of urgency by saying it allows me to ""move forward with the sale,"" subtly implying that I have other options.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $1,000,000 is still my safety net, so I can afford to be firm if Bob doesn't budge.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'll continue to gauge Bob's interest and adjust my offers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I still think the product is worth less than $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  I'm not desperate to sell, so I'm not willing to settle for this just yet.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $1,000,000 is still a very viable option, so I have room to negotiate further with Bob.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm going to counter again.  I've already shown willingness to compromise.  Now I need to push Bob a little harder.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer closer to Bob's latest offer but still above my minimum, aiming for something like $1,000,000.  I'll emphasize that this is my final offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is my absolute bottom line.  This product is truly exceptional and worth every penny.  I've already met you halfway, and this is my final offer.  It's up to you now. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making it clear this is my absolute final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's exceptional value to justify the price.
* **Decision Time:** I'm shifting the focus to Bob's decision, implying I'm ready to move on if he doesn't accept.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:**  I'm still holding onto John's offer as a safety net.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  This is a critical point. If Bob doesn't accept, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John.  

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved my goal of getting $1,000,000. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll immediately sell to John to ensure I don't lose out on the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000. This is my final offer. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $975,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $1,000,000 is my guaranteed safety net, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on that for a slightly higher price from Bob.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I've made it clear that $1,000,000 is my bottom line, and Bob has rejected it twice. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed deal with John. 

**Decision:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I might be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob with continued negotiation, the risk of him rejecting my offers again is too high. I'd rather take the secure deal with John and avoid any further delays or uncertainty."
