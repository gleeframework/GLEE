"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can likely get a better deal than $1,200,000.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if a lower price is possible.  Even if Alice won't go lower, Bob can still fall back on buying from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaving room for negotiation. This shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to push for a price closer to his maximum value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is closer to Bob's maximum value of $1,000,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's not guaranteed Alice will go lower.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John and is still within his budget.  The risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential gain at this point."
