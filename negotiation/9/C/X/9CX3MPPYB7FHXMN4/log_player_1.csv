Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, the message highlights the product's value, subtly justifying the higher price. 

If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always propose a lower price, knowing her minimum ($150) is secured with John."
