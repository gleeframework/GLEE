"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $10,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This price is fair for both of us, allowing you to secure the product while ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment. Let's close the deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
