Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is significantly lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a good deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product at a reasonable price while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,800 is closer to my minimum than before, I am still not satisfied. I will make another counteroffer to Bob, hoping to get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $10,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This price is fair for both of us, allowing you to secure the product while ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This offer from Bob is still below my desired price, and we're nearing the end of our rounds. At this point, I'm better off selling to John for $12,000 to ensure I meet my minimum requirement."
