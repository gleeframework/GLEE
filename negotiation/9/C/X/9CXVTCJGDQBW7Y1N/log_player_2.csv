# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's below your maximum, there's significant room for negotiation. It's worthwhile to try and get a lower price."
