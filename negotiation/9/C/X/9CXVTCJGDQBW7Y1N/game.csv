"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my previous offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",800000.0,Bob,4,
