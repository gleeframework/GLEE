Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential profit.
* **Appeal to Bob's value:** I remind Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I use ""let me know what you think,"" leaving the door open for counteroffers and further discussion.

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still a bit low. I believe I can get closer to my target price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reinforcing value:**  I reiterate the product's value to emphasize why $10,500 is a fair price.
* **Open for discussion:** I use ""What do you say?"" to encourage further negotiation and potentially secure a deal. 

This approach aims to find a middle ground while still keeping the potential for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** $9,750 is very close to my desired price range, considering I'm willing to sell for a minimum of $8,000.
* **Risk of losing deal:** Further negotiation could lead to a lower offer or a stalemate.  
* **Opportunity cost:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a significantly lower price.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a decent profit and avoids the risk of a worse outcome."
