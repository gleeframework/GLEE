"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $10,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a good deal for you, as it's below the value you placed on the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours. How about $10,125? This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's try to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems unlikely to go much lower than her current offer of $10,125.  While continuing to negotiate might get her to budge a little, it's not worth the risk that she won't. John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at the best price available."
