"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $10,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a good deal for you, as it's below the value you placed on the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours. How about $10,125? This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's try to finalize this deal.",10125.0,Alice,5,
