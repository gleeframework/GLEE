Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $120, there's a chance Bob will pay slightly less, netting a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below my guaranteed sale price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, the slightly inflated price leaves a tiny window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested."
