Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it provides significant value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""significant value"" of the product, I aim to anchor Bob's perception of its worth. Even if he doesn't agree to $150, it sets a higher baseline for further discussion.
* **Alternative Option:**  The presence of John, willing to pay $100, acts as a safety net. I can always walk away from the negotiation with Bob if it doesn't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider selling the product for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, there's still potential room for negotiation. By immediately accepting his first counteroffer, I might miss out on the chance to secure a slightly higher price.  I'll try to nudge him a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $125, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** This classic negotiation tactic can often be effective. It positions the offer as a fair compromise.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $125 is still a significant profit margin over my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $125 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still think we can reach an agreement. Could you consider $110 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could try to push for a bit more, the potential gain is getting smaller. Holding out for $115 or $120 risks prolonging the negotiation and potentially losing Bob altogether. 
* **Solid Profit:** $110 is still a good profit margin ($10 over my minimum). It's often better to secure a good deal than to risk losing it for a marginally better one. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Every round of negotiation takes time. Accepting now allows me to move on to other potential deals or tasks."
