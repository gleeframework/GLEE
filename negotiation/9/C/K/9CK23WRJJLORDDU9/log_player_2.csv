Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,300,000. Since you have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it's in your best interest to cut your losses and secure the product at the lower price."
