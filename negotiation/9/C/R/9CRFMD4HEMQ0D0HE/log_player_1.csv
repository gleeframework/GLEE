{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This is a starting offer that is slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to emphasize the value proposition for Bob, which could help him be more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $12,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $12,250, which is just above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by being too stubborn.  I'm going to accept his offer."
