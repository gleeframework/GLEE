Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $8,100 as a final offer, but if you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000, and her language suggests she's prepared to walk away. You can secure the product at your target price with John."
