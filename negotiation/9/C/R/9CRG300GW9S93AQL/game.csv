"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $7,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. Let's find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,750.  Let's try $8,250. It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we are getting closer. I could do $7,900, and I think that's a very fair offer.",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $8,100 as a final offer, but if you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",8100.0,Alice,7,
