"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product,  $950000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

This is our best offer given the value the product provides. We hope this aligns more closely with your budget while still reflecting the product's worth.

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $825000. It's a fair price that's reasonable for both of us.  What do you say?",825000.0,Bob,4,
