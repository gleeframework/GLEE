"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our unique product to you. After careful consideration, we've decided to offer it to you at an exclusive price of $950000. This is a special opportunity, considering the value you would receive from this product. We believe this price reflects its exceptional quality and benefits. Let us know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left, so there is plenty of time to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Bob starts with a very strong counteroffer, directly at his maximum price.  
* **Justification:** Bob highlights the value of the product while emphasizing his budget constraint. 
* **Openness:** He leaves the door open for negotiation,  inviting Alice to consider his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. We would like to make a counteroffer of $850000. This is our best offer given the value the product provides. We hope this aligns more closely with your budget while still reflecting the product's worth. Please let us know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should hold firm to his initial counteroffer.  By rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering again, he can potentially secure a price even closer to his target. There are still 7 rounds remaining, so there's time to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $825,000. It's a fair price that's reasonable for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** Bob increases his offer slightly, demonstrating flexibility but staying within his budget.
* **Compromise:**  He proposes splitting the difference between his previous offer and Alice's, showcasing a desire for a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  He emphasizes the ""fair price"" for both sides, framing it as a collaborative negotiation."
