I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is significantly above my minimum value of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation.  I believe this price point will make Bob think seriously about buying while also giving me a good starting point for negotiation."

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I believe I can still get a better price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm offering $1,600,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my target."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a slightly better price.  I'll reject his offer and make one final counteroffer before considering selling to John."

I'm going to make one final counteroffer of $1,450,000.  This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum value. If Bob rejects this, I'll accept John's offer and move on."
