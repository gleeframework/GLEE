"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to start with my ideal price, knowing that John will pay that amount. This way, I establish a high starting point and see if Bob is willing to pay my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below what the product is worth to me.  I have 9 more rounds to potentially get closer to my ideal price with Bob, or sell to John for my minimum acceptable amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while staying within my minimum acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option. I'm going to keep trying with Bob to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,050,000. This is a further concession, but it's still above Bob's last offer and closer to what I'm willing to accept.  I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob, but I'm also mindful that I have the option to sell to John at any point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still offering a price below my minimum.  I have a few more rounds to negotiate with him. While I could sell to John for $1,200,000, I'm going to try to get as close as possible to my minimum with Bob.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to his offer but still within my acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,025,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still slightly above Bob's last offer. It's a move towards finding a compromise, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this yet. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $998,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $998,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it. We are now in the final rounds, and I'm willing to risk not closing the deal with Bob to see if I can get closer to my minimum.  I believe that I can get a slightly better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1010000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,010,000.  This is a very small decrease from my previous offer, but it shows flexibility and signals that I'm willing to meet in the middle.  It's also very close to my minimum, so if Bob rejects this, I'm likely going to accept his final counteroffer in the next round or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000. I've reached the final round and I'm not willing to risk not closing the deal at all.  John is a guaranteed sale, and I'm not comfortable accepting an offer that is below my minimum."
