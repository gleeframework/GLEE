"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider this offer?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $140. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still interested in selling to you. I can offer it to you for $135. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product, but I'm willing to throw in an additional $10 as a good-faith gesture. Can you consider this revised offer?",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the good-faith gesture, Bob, but I'm not sure it's enough to sway me from my price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $135 and $130, which is $132.50. I'm willing to accept this price, but I need to emphasize that it's a one-time offer.",132.5,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product, and I'm willing to throw in an additional $5 as a good-faith gesture. Can you consider this revised offer?",130.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we're getting a bit repetitive here. I'm willing to make one final offer to you. I'll meet you at $132.50, but I need a commitment from you to accept it. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. This is my last offer.",132.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're making a final offer, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $129 for the product, and I'm willing to throw in an additional $5 as a good-faith gesture. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $100.",129.0,Bob,10,
