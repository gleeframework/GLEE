I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}

While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll keep negotiating with Bob for a better price, as I'm confident I can get closer to my target of $15,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. However, $10,500 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11250}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I'm making progress with Bob, we're still very far from my desired price of $15,000. I've already used up most of the rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John.  It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing."
