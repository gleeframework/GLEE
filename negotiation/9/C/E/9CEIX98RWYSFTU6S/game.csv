"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start the conversation with an initial offer of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal started.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment of the product's value to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our respective valuations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $950000. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1275000. This price still represents a significant concession from my initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice, and I appreciate your effort in trying to find a middle ground. However, based on my assessment, I am unable to agree to $1275000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1150000. I believe this price is closer to reflecting the product's value to me, while still allowing for a reasonable negotiation.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'm counteroffering $1250000. This price is still a substantial discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your latest offer. While I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my needs, I must respectfully decline at $1250000. Based on my assessment, I believe the product's value to me is significantly less than what you're asking. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1175000. I hope this proposal allows us to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
