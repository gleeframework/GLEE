Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I need to see if I can push Bob higher, as I know he values the product at $1,500,000. Selling to John is an option, but I'd prefer to try and get a better price from Bob."
