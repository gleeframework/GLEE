Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing within a profitable range for Alice (above $8,000).
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:** Offering a price too close to John's $8,000 backup offer leaves potential profit on the table and might make Bob undervalue the product.

This strategy balances ambition with a degree of flexibility to increase the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob at a price significantly beneficial to Alice."
