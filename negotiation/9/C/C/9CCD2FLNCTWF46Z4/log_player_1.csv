Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is higher than my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  Since he values the product at $15,000, this price gives him a potential benefit, but still allows me to earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $16,000 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer. I believe I can still get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and hopefully, it will be enticing enough for him to accept while still allowing me to earn more than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,500 is higher than what John would pay. While I'd prefer to get my original asking price, I'm willing to accept this offer to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
