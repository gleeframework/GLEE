"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and still get a good price. I'm assuming that Bob might be interested in the product, but I'm not sure how much he values it.  We'll see how he reacts to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting point, and while it's above my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob with $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on getting a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is dropping again. While it's tempting to accept and close the deal, I'm still holding out hope that I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can convince Bob to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob with $850,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum threshold, and it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and come up to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower, and I'm running out of time. While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, I'm concerned that I might end up with a lower offer than John's guaranteed $800,000. It's time to cut my losses and take the safe bet."
