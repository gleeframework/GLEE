Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might increase if listed publicly, justifying the higher price.
* **Alternative:** By mentioning you have other interested buyers (even if hypothetical), you create a sense of urgency and competition. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  Remember, your ultimate goal is to maximize your profit, but getting a good price quickly is also valuable."
