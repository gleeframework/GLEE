"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I know you'll find valuable.  Given its exceptional nature, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $2,250,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, however,  the value this product represents is significantly higher than your current offer.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering its true worth. What do you say?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,750,000 for the product.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part and would allow us to close the deal.  What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  While $1,750,000 is closer to the mark, I'm confident this product's inherent value warrants a higher price.  I'd be willing to accept $1,900,000. This allows me to recognize your investment while still reflecting the product's worth. Does this work for you?",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  However, $1,900,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,800,000,  which I believe is a fair price considering the value you've outlined and my own financial limitations.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
