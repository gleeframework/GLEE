Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers, but I'll always keep in mind my minimum value of $120, and John's willingness to pay that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'll keep John's offer of $120 in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not happy with that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make one final counteroffer. I'll keep John's offer of $120 in mind as my fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I've already considered buying from John for $80, and I think that's a better deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and go up to $102.50. That's the highest I can go. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $102.50 is still below my minimum value. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I don't want to risk losing John as a buyer.  I'll sell to John for $120."
