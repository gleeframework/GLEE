"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I believe this product could be beneficial, the price point you've presented is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that offer is quite low considering the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this still reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still quite a gap from what I'm willing to pay. If you're able to come down to $800,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
