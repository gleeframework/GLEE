Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $180 for it. It's a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a bargain. 
* **Justification:**  A brief, positive statement about the product's value can make the price more palatable.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high might scare Bob off. Offering it at $180 leaves a buffer. If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John at your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob (e.g., if he's a tough negotiator), you might adjust your starting price."
