"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

The price is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It makes more sense to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly establish a lower price point and see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  This will be a good starting point for gauging Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price. While buying from John for $1,200,000 is a good option, there's still a chance to get a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

Bob is now offering the maximum price he's willing to pay. This is a serious offer, and hopefully, Alice will understand that he's not going to go higher. It's a good tactic to see if Alice is willing to accept a deal that's closer to his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While the price is getting closer to his budget, it's still above his limit.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can reach a lower price. Buying from John is still an option if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

Bob is making a slightly higher offer, hoping to encourage Alice to meet him in the middle. It's a calculated risk, but it might be the push Alice needs to reach a deal. If Alice rejects this, it's likely she's holding out for more, and Bob might be better off buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still close to his limit, but the price is still too high. Alice seems willing to negotiate, but she's holding on to a higher price point.  Rejection will hopefully encourage Alice to make a more reasonable offer.  If Alice continues to refuse, Bob can always purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

Bob is making one final push, offering a price that is still lower than Alice's last offer but closer to his budget.  If Alice rejects this, Bob will likely move to purchase from John to secure the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to secure the product. While Alice is getting closer to Bob's price, the negotiation is taking longer than expected.  There's a risk that if Bob continues to negotiate, he might not be able to buy the product at all.  Since John offers a reliable price, buying from him is the safest option to ensure Bob gets the product within the allotted rounds."
