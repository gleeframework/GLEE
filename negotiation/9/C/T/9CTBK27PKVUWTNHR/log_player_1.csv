Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. It's worth $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $120 as my initial offer. This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** My message is friendly and informative. I highlight the product's value to me, but I'm also making it clear that I'm open to negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Initial Offer:**  Starting with a lower price than my minimum value encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Negotiation:** I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob if he makes a counteroffer. I will consider his offer, but I won't sell below my minimum value of $150.
* **John as Backup:** The existence of John as a potential buyer gives me leverage in the negotiation. If Bob is unwilling to meet my price, I can confidently walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am looking to spend no more than $80 on the product. Would you consider lowering the price to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum value of $150. While it's closer to my initial offer, it's not yet a good deal for me.

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still too low.
* **Counteroffer:** I'm prepared to make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value. 
* **John as Leverage:**  I'm still confident that I can sell the product to John for $150 if necessary, which gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still above my minimum value of $150. This shows that I'm flexible but not desperate.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging. I'm highlighting the value for both of us to emphasize that this is a win-win scenario.
* **Strategy:** 
    * **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit margin. 
    * **Finality:** I'm setting a clear expectation that this is likely my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept. 
    * **Leverage:** I'm still keeping John as my backup option, so I'm not under pressure to accept any price below my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. This would allow me to purchase it without exceeding my spending limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum value of $150.  While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to risk selling below my minimum value.  I'm confident I can sell to John for $150, which is a much better outcome.

**Strategy:**

* **John as the Better Option:** Selling to John at $150 guarantees a higher profit than selling to Bob at $100.
* **Minimizing Risk:** I'm avoiding the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price than I'm comfortable with.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time.  Selling to John now allows me to secure the higher price and move on to other opportunities."
