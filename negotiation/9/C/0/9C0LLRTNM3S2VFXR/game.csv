"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that I believe holds significant value. I'm starting with a price of $1500000, but I'm open to discussing a fair price that benefits us both.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you've described. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is significantly lower than the value I see in this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This price reflects the potential of this product and is still a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I still think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. Can you consider this compromise?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to compromise further, but $1050000 is still below what I consider fair.  I'm offering $1100000 as a final compromise. This offer reflects the value of the product and allows for a win-win situation. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000 again, but I think that's the maximum I can go. Can you consider this final offer?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
