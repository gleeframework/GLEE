"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about I sell it to you for $135? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of it.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you do any better than that?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob. I can see you're really serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $130, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product, just like I offered before. Can you meet me at this price?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you $130, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. If you buy the product from me for $130, I'll include a free accessory that's worth $20. It's a great value, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",130.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer of the free accessory, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $130. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product, and I'd like to keep the free accessory as well. Can you meet me at this price?",125.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to throw in a second accessory, worth another $20, on top of the first one. If you buy the product from me for $135, you'll get both accessories. That's a total of $40 in extras, and I think it's a great deal. What do you say?",135.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the creativity with the accessories, but I'm still not willing to pay $135. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product, and I'll take the two accessories you're offering. That's the best price I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at this price?",125.0,Bob,10,
