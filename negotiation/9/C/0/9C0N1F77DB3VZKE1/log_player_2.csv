Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, Bob. I think the product is worth more than $105, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $110. That's my final offer.

Alice is clearly signaling this is her last offer and going lower than $110 is unlikely. Accepting this offer gets the product well below John's price."
