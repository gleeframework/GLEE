"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your work.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  This is my maximum, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet halfway at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway *between our last two offers*  at $1,150,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
