"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell the product to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

It's a good deal, but Bob can likely get a better price. He should reject the offer and counter with a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1150000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than her initial offer, he can likely still negotiate a lower price. He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his initial offer of $1,000,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1075000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1125000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, it's getting close to his initial counteroffer of $1,000,000 and the risk of further negotiation leading to a breakdown is high.  Accepting this offer will save him $375,000 compared to buying from John."
