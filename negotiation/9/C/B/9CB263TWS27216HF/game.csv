"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell the product to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price.  Considering the product's true value to me, I'm willing to pay $1000000. Let's see if we can find a price we're both happy with.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1150000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1075000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1075000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1125000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
