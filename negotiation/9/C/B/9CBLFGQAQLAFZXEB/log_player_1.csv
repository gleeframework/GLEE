Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize that this is a ""great deal for both of us"", highlighting mutual benefit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not locking myself into this price, making it clear that I'm open to counteroffers.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  It's a good starting point that allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Control the Negotiation:** I set the initial terms, forcing Bob to come to me.
* **Maintain Backup Option:** I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation fails. 

I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our respective valuations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value:**  While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my asking price, it's still $250,000 below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially considering Bob's eagerness to negotiate.  
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and signals that I'm not desperate to sell.

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap but still securing a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm prepared to sell for $980,000. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility. $980,000 is a compromise that keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose out.
* **Reasoning and Persuasion:** I offer a clear explanation for my counteroffer, focusing on ""compromise"" and ""fairness"" to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Test Bob's Limits:** I'm seeing how far Bob is willing to go.
* **Maximize Profit:**  While it's below my initial asking price, it's still a significant profit.
* **Avoid a Deal Breaker:** I'm not so far apart from Bob that he'll walk away.

I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I respect your valuation, I am still not comfortable with the price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $960,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob's counteroffer of $960,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. It's clear that we're at a stalemate, and further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Risk of Losing Time and Profit:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price or a prolonged process, potentially costing me both time and profit.
* **Secure Profit with John:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me my minimum desired profit and ensures a quick and secure transaction.

**Strategy:**

By choosing to sell to John, I prioritize:

* **Profit Maximization:**  $1,200,000 is the highest possible price I can currently achieve.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Selling to John avoids further negotiation and potential delays.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  A deal with John eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.

I'm confident that selling to John is the best decision in this scenario, as it secures my desired profit while minimizing risk and maximizing efficiency."
