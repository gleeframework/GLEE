"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm initially offering it for $20,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he can bring the price down.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help me understand how badly Bob wants the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:** I always have the option of selling to John for my minimum acceptable price, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Far Apart:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal to Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm willing to walk away from the deal with Bob if he doesn't budge significantly, knowing I have John as a backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", 
""product_price"": 17000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:** I've lowered my price by $3,000, which shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm still keeping the price well above my absolute minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value reinforces its worth and justifies a higher price in Bob's mind.
* **Seeking Common Ground:**  Suggesting a middle ground encourages Bob to engage in a more collaborative negotiation rather than simply throwing out low offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given it some thought, and I'd like to propose a price of $15,000. I believe this still leaves room for negotiation, while also reflecting the value I see in the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Met My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,000 matches my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Need to Risk Further:** While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee Bob would agree, and I risk losing the sale altogether.  
* **Secure the Deal:** It's better to accept a good offer now than risk losing it by being too greedy."
