,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. To start the negotiation, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair starting point, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  However, $1,000,000 is too far below the product's true value. To move things forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000.  This reflects a significant reduction on my part while acknowledging the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  To demonstrate my seriousness, I'm willing to pay $1,500,000.  This is a substantial offer that reflects the value I place on the product. Let's continue working towards a deal that benefits both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
