"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an item valued at $10,000 by you, while also providing me with a fair return for my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.  You have a strong bargaining position because you have a backup option with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. However, I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle and ensures a reasonable return for my investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but $11,000 is still above your maximum. You have a strong backup option with John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate.  You can likely secure a better deal with a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutual agreement. In light of this, I am willing to consider $10,900 as a fair price for the product. This allows us to stay close to the midpoint and ensures a satisfactory return for my investment.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is now very close to your desired price of $10,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small, and the risk of losing the deal is high.  It's likely that Alice won't go lower, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate. It's a good deal for you, and accepting the offer is the most logical decision."
