Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I think the product is valuable, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too far below my value for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle, and see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're coming up in price, but $975,000 is still too low. How about we meet at $1,025,000? This is a fair compromise that takes both of our positions into account. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we are getting closer.  To show you I'm serious, I can go up to $1,000,000.  That's a big jump for me, and it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly what John is offering. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, this is a solid deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
