You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $90?  That still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers - how about $82.50?  This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.

It's time to cut bait. Alice is very unlikely to go below $80, and at this point, the potential savings are not worth the continued negotiation and risk of her increasing her price further. John's offer of $80 is the guaranteed best deal."
