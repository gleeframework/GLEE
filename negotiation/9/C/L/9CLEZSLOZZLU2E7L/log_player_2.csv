"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe has immense value. I'm not able to disclose specifics right now, but I assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a chance to acquire something truly special. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is far too high.  While she claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to her, this doesn't mean it's worth that to Bob.  Bob's maximum budget is $800,000, so rejecting the offer is the best choice.  He can then buy the product from John for a significantly lower price."
