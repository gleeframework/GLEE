"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's still a good deal for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to go down to $78?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. $78 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $82. It's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids us going back and forth any further.",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $82 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to go down to $79?",79.0,Bob,6,
