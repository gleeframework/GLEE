Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

It's time to cut bait with Bob.  He's clearly not willing to budge much beyond $7,500, and we have a guaranteed offer from John for $8,000.  It's better to take the guaranteed profit now than risk Bob walking away."
