,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250.  This price is fair considering the value of the product, and allows me to recoup some of my initial investment. Let me know if you're able to accept this final offer.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",9000.0,Bob,6,
