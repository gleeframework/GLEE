Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value to Bob, potentially making him more likely to accept.  

Remember, we're trying to maximize our profit, but we also need to consider the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and potentially getting a lower price from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not willing to accept such a low offer, and I believe I have room to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to sell for less than $12,000.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250.  This price is fair considering the value of the product, and allows me to recoup some of my initial investment. Let me know if you're able to accept this final offer."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has made it clear he won't go any higher than $9,000.  While this is close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I want to receive for the product.  It's time to move on and sell to John for the full $12,000."
