The product is way over your budget.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

Let's start with a significant discount.  $900,000 is a much more reasonable starting point for both of us."

$1,200,000 is still too high. Let's see if we can get closer to my preferred price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

Let's split the difference a bit.  $950,000 feels like a fair price, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to meet me halfway."

Alice is still too high. We're getting closer, but I want to see if we can get to my target price without going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay John $1,000,000, so if Alice wants to make a deal, she needs to come down to this price."
