"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $1,500,000. Let's split the difference and go with $1,350,000. That's a fair price that reflects the value you've acknowledged in the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from $1,350,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think that's a fair price for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up, but $1,250,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Considering the value you see in the product,  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at $1,400,000.  That's a good compromise for both of us.  Let's reach an agreement now.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go up to $1,300,000. I think that's a fair price for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
