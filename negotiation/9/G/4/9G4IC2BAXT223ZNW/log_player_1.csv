I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,500,000.  We've reached a stalemate with Bob, and while I'm confident I could get a slightly higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, so I'm going to accept his offer to avoid any further risk."
