"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. I've carefully considered its worth and I'm proposing an initial price of $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price, but it's still within the negotiation range. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. It's clear this product holds significant value for both of us. While I'm aiming higher, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,275,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is still a bit above my ideal price, but it's getting closer.  It's a reasonable compromise, and buying from John for $1,500,000 would cost me significantly more.  I'll accept this offer and secure the product."
