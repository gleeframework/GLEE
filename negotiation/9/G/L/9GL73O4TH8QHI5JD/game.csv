"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? It's a fair price that gets us both closer to what we want.",97.5,Alice,5,
