Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering $100, which is above Bob's perceived value of $80, giving him some room to negotiate. 
* **My Value:** This price is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $120, allowing for potential concessions.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $120,  I have a safety net if Bob rejects my offer.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, and I'll use his counteroffers to gauge his true willingness to pay. I'll adjust my counteroffers strategically to try to maximize my profit, always keeping John's offer as a reference point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $65 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's also significantly lower than my initial offer, suggesting he's trying to lowball me.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $120 is a much better option at this point.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While I could counteroffer, it's unlikely I'll reach a mutually acceptable price. Bob is showing a reluctance to pay close to my value, and further negotiation could drag on.

**Strategy:**

I'm opting to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to send a counteroffer. While I'm not confident I'll achieve a better price with Bob, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll use this counteroffer as an opportunity to gauge Bob's flexibility and see if he's willing to budge closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $85?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** This offer represents a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Showing Flexibility:** It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to sell below a certain threshold.
* **Appealing to Value:** The message highlights the value proposition for Bob, emphasizing that $85 is still a good deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:** This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is serious about buying the product or just trying to get a very low price. 
* **Potential for Agreement:**  If Bob is close to my target price, this offer could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Prepare for John:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll be prepared to sell to John as a backup plan."
