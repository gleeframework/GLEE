"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $70. Could you consider that?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal work.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $85 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we meet in the middle at $77.50? Could you consider that?",77.5,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $79.50. Could you consider that?",79.5,Bob,6,
