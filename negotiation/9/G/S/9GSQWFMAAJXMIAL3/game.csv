"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $12000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $14000 for this product.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $17000. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $14000. This is the most I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're firm on your offer of $14000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, to $16500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $16500 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $15000, but that's my final offer.  If we can't agree on that, I'll have to move on to another seller.",15000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're trying to be fair, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my last offer, and I hope we can agree on this price.",16000.0,Alice,9,
