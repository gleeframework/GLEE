Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is too far below what I need to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground. $9,500 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This shows a significant compromise on my end, and it's a price that would make this a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is tempting, but I'm aiming to keep it closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to settle at $10,250? That's a reasonable compromise, I believe."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for $10,000, but I'm not comfortable going below $10,500.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get what we want.  Think about it carefully, as time is running out, and I have other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled that $10,500 is her absolute bottom line.  While you could try to negotiate further, you're running out of rounds, and there's a real risk that Alice will walk away.  At this point, it's in your best interest to secure the product for $10,000 from John.  This guarantees you get the product at your target price and avoids the potential for a failed negotiation with Alice."
