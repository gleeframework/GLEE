"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is too far below what I need to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. While $12,500 is getting closer, it's still a bit high for me.  Could you consider $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground. $9,500 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This shows a significant compromise on my end, and it's a price that would make this a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is tempting, but I'm aiming to keep it closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to settle at $10,250? That's a reasonable compromise, I believe.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for $10,000, but I'm not comfortable going below $10,500.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get what we want.  Think about it carefully, as time is running out, and I have other options.",10500.0,Alice,7,
