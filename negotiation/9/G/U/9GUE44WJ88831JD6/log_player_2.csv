"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good deal. This price is still below his maximum budget of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation. He is likely hoping that Alice will be willing to compromise to close the deal, especially with the knowledge that Bob could always go to John for a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget, and while it's not the absolute lowest price, it's only $50,000 more than what John would sell the product for.  Bob has already made a significant counteroffer, and further negotiation might not yield a better outcome, particularly since Bob only has 7 rounds left.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price he can afford, minimizing potential risk and saving time."
