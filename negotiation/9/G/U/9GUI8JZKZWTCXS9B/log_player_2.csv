"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  This is a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to make a profit. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $11,500 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000. While you could reject and go with John, accepting this offer saves you $500."
