Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,100,000 is a strong offer that still nets a significant profit above Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This creates a win-win scenario if Bob recognizes the potential upside.
* **Confident Approach:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and Bob's potential gain. This encourages a positive response. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, I'm prepared to negotiate within a reasonable range to secure the best possible deal."
