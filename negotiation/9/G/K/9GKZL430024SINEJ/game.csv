"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, but I need to make a fair profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm offering you my final price of $10,000. This is the absolute maximum I can pay. If we can't reach an agreement at this point, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, and I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is my final price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",11500.0,Alice,7,
