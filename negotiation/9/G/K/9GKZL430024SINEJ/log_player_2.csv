"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, but I need to make a fair profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a better price in the following rounds."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her previous offer, $12,000 is still above his budget. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, $11,000 is still higher than his target of $8,000. He should continue to negotiate. He might be able to get a better price, or he could decide to buy from John if he believes that Alice is unlikely to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm offering you my final price of $10,000. This is the absolute maximum I can pay. If we can't reach an agreement at this point, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, and I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is my final price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal budget, and he's already indicated that he's willing to walk away. John offers the product for his target price, and with only a few rounds remaining, it's likely Alice won't go any lower."
