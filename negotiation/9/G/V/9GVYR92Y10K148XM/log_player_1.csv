Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price that secures the most profit, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation while staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,000,000 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $1,350,000, you leave a potential profit margin of $350,000, which is significantly higher than John's offer. This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
