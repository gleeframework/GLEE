"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. Is this something you're interested in?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $130?  It's a great price for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $175. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $175 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $145. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $145 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll counter with $160. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",160.0,Alice,5,
