You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $950,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and still leaves room for negotiation. It's a reasonable starting point, pushing Alice closer to her own value while still leaving Bob with a substantial saving compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than what Bob is hoping for. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer keeps Bob in a stronger position to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to push Alice towards her own value for the product. Offering $1,000,000 is a significant drop from Alice's previous offer, but still leaves room for a potential deal. It's a strong counteroffer that shows Bob is serious about negotiating but is also willing to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now lower than buying from John, and it's also closer to Bob's desired price.  While there might be a chance to push Alice down further, accepting the offer is the most strategic choice at this point. It secures the purchase at a price lower than John's while leaving some room for potential savings compared to the previous rounds.  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result and could risk losing the deal altogether."
