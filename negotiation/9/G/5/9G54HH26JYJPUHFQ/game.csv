"Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you, given its potential to generate at least $1,500,000 in value for you. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,200,000. This represents a significant gain for you and a fair price for me. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential value to me, and it would allow me to save some money. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. The product's value is significant, and I'm confident it will generate more than that for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to the price I need.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,125,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
