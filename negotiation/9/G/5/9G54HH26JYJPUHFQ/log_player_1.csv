Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you, given its potential to generate at least $1,500,000 in value for you. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,200,000. This represents a significant gain for you and a fair price for me. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a price close to the middle ground between our values. This is a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential worth to him, making it clear that this is a good deal for him.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not going all-in with my initial offer. This allows for a back and forth, potentially getting me a better price.
* **John as a safety net:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup in case the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential value to me, and it would allow me to save some money. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob clearly sees the value in the product, and I'm confident I can push for a price closer to $1,200,000. Selling to John would only net me my minimum, and I'm aiming for a higher return.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. The product's value is significant, and I'm confident it will generate more than that for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to the price I need.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but stand firm:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but I'm not giving in completely. 
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential value to him, subtly emphasizing that he's getting a good deal. 
* **Focus on a win-win:**  I'm framing my offer as a win-win for both of us, hopefully making it more appealing.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm not getting too close to John's offer yet, keeping some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,125,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,100,000.  It's a good deal for me considering the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of Bob rejecting again. While I could try for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing this deal entirely and having to settle for John's $1,000,000 offer is too high. It's time to accept and secure the profit."
