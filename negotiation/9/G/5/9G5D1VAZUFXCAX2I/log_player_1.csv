Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value of the product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, but I'm open to further discussion.  What do you think?

Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $1150000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $950000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to get a reasonable deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
