"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, giving you a significant value and me a fair return.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good but not great.** You're getting a good deal ($200,000 less than your maximum), but there's still room for negotiation. 
* **There's no rush.** You have the option of buying from John, so you can afford to try and get a better price from Alice.

**Next Step:**  You should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to $800,000 (her value)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. It's still a good profit for you, and it's the highest I'm willing to go at this point. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is still a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is a good compromise.**  You're getting the product for $250,000 less than your maximum, and it's only $100,000 more than your initial counteroffer.
* **There's no guarantee of a better deal.** If you reject this offer and make another counteroffer, Alice might not accept it. You could end up paying John the full $1,200,000.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer is the best option, as it secures a good deal without risking a worse outcome."
