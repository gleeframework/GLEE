"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. It's still a good profit for you, and it's the highest I'm willing to go at this point. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is still a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,
