"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $95 for it. This price reflects not only its worth but also provides you with an opportunity to acquire it at a reasonable premium. I'm confident it will be a valuable addition to your collection or needs. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no need to pay $95. By rejecting Alice's offer, you leave the door open for a potential counter-offer or you can proceed with buying from John."
