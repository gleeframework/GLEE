Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth a lot to the right person.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than $10,000, I think I can do better. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum. Let's split the difference â€“  I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $10000 for the product. Can you meet me at $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to go down to $11,500 for the product. This is a very reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. Let's close this deal, shall we?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $10500 for the product. Can you meet me at $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating, we're running out of rounds.  $11,000 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $10,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
