"Alice, thanks for your offer. However, your starting price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it reflects the worth of this product.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $975,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I can do $725,000. This offer keeps us moving towards a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations is still quite large. To be fair to both of us, I can drop to $900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $775,000, which I believe is a very fair offer considering the market value.",775000.0,Bob,6,
