"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still gives Bob a good deal considering the product is worth $12,000 to him. 

I'm aiming for a quick and successful negotiation, but I'm also prepared to continue if necessary, and I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a compromise that's fair for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal value. This counteroffer demonstrates my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, but it also maintains a significant profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,800 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a low price, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result.  Selling to John at $10,000 is the most sensible option to secure a fair price and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
