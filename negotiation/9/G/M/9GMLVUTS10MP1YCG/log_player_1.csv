This offer is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than my ideal price. I believe I can secure a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,150,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise. While it's not my initial asking price, it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price and closer to what I want. Accepting his offer ensures a profitable deal without risking further negotiation."
