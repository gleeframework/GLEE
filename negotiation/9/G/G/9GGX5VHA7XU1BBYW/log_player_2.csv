"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us. Would you be interested in paying $10,000 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than her stated value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a better price with her or proceeding with your backup plan to buy from John."
