Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to gauge his interest.
* **Room for Negotiation:** $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still allowing me to earn more than John's offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and positive tone encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's value to Bob to make the price seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  $13,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I believe I can push for a better deal.
* **Negotiation is Key:** I want to continue the negotiation to see if Bob is willing to budge closer to my desired price. 
* **John as a Backup:** John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Round:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his $13,000, but still below my desired $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value the product holds. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:** I'm raising the price slightly, aiming for a middle ground between Bob's offer and my desired price. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider the price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message remains positive and open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to pay $13,200 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $13,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $13,000.  However, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Continuing the negotiation could lead to a stalemate, as Bob seems unwilling to go higher. 
* **Secure Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a higher profit, which is worth the potential for a slightly better deal with Bob.

**Conclusion:** While I would prefer a higher price, John's offer provides a surefire way to get the product off my hands and secure a good profit."
