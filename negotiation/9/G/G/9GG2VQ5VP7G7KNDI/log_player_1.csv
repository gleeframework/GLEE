Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is significant and $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $19,000?"", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $19,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $11,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is not moving significantly towards a price that is acceptable. It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap in the remaining rounds. Accepting the guaranteed $15,000 from John is the best option now."
