"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This gives you a slight advantage while ensuring a fair deal for me. Consider this a gesture of good faith, as I'm confident you'll see the immense potential this product holds. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
