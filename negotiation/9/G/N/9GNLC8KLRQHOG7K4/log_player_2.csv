It's always worth trying to negotiate, even if the initial offer is your maximum price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price, and you have nothing to lose by trying."

While Alice has come down in price, there's still room for negotiation. You're still willing to pay less than her offer, so it's worth trying to get a better deal."

Alice's offer:

Alice has come down to a price that is very close to your target.  You've saved $70,000 compared to John's price. While you could continue negotiating, it's unlikely Alice will go any lower and you risk losing the deal."
