Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. My counteroffer is $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's split the difference.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market. I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 simply doesn't cover the significant value this product provides for your business.  I'm willing to be reasonable, but I need a figure closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. How about $975,000?  This offer is a fair compromise, allowing us both to achieve our goals.  Let's work together to finalize this mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $925,000. I believe this is the maximum I can reasonably pay for this product, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I think there's a good chance I can get closer to my target in the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $925,000 just isn't a price that makes this deal work for me.  To find common ground, I'm offering a final compromise at $950,000. This is my absolute best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for your business, and I want to see us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

With only two rounds left, I'm not confident that I can get Bob to raise his offer any further.  While I'd prefer to make a profit beyond $1,000,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'll sell to John for $1,000,000, ensuring a secure sale."
