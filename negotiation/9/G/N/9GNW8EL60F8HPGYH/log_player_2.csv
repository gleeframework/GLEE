It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  You can potentially save a significant amount of money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, and it's a good starting point for negotiation.  It's likely Alice will counter, but we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price."

Alice is sticking to her original price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further.  I'll make another counteroffer, hoping to find a middle ground."

I'm going to increase my counteroffer to $1,100,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am still looking for a better price than her initial offer."

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is a good price.  It's closer to my ideal price than John's offer, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in more time and uncertainty.  I'm going to accept Alice's offer and secure the product."
