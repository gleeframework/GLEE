"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob is willing to pay. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to compromise. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:**  While $1,750,000 is a significant price, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000). 
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and open to negotiation. This helps keep the relationship with Bob positive even if he rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start closer to  $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, he has shown interest. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price in the following rounds.
* **Selling to John is a viable option:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $1,500,000, which is a much better deal. However, I want to explore the negotiation with Bob further before making that decision."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to negotiate. I'm proposing we meet in the middle. How about $1,200,000? This price still allows me to make a good profit while considering your budget."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while making a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price. 
* **Midpoint Approach:** Offering $1,200,000 is a midpoint between my previous offer ($1,750,000) and Bob's offer ($700,000). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable and that $1,200,000 is a fair price given its worth.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That being said, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. Could we try something around $850,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. While it's closer to my desired price, it's not yet a good deal for me. 
* **Negotiation is still ongoing:** Bob is showing willingness to negotiate and is gradually increasing his offer. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John is still a strong option:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, which is a much better deal than accepting Bob's current offer.  However, I want to explore if Bob will increase his offer further before making that final decision."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 was still too high for you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This is a substantial price reduction, and it would allow us both to reach a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
