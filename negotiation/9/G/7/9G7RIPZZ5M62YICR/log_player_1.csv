"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price ($11,000) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. Since the product is worth $8,000 to him, he might be willing to negotiate upward to secure the deal.  I'm also leaving some room for negotiation in case he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell. This price also gives Bob room to negotiate further, potentially reaching a mutually acceptable middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm not desperate to sell and want to see if I can get closer to my minimum price."

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly.  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, but I still want to try to get closer to my minimum price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm getting closer, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I want to see if I can push him a little further before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10100}
```

I'm making a small final concession to Bob.  I'm getting closer to his last offer, but still hoping to get a price that's closer to my minimum.  I'm  also leaving some room for negotiation in case he counteroffers again. If he doesn't budge, I'm ready to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk him rejecting my next counteroffer. John is offering my minimum value, so it's a secure and guaranteed deal."
