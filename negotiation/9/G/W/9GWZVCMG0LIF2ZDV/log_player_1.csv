``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my value, but I'm also willing to negotiate.  I'm aware that Bob may counteroffer, so I'm prepared to adjust my price depending on his response.  However, I will always keep John's offer of $15,000 in mind as my floor price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $11,000 is significantly below my minimum threshold. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."

Bob's offer:

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my preferred range. I'm not ready to settle for that price yet. I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
