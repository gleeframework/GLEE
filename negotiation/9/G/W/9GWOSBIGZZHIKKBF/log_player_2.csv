"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100.
* Alice is offering the product for $95.
* You can buy the product from John for $100.

Since you can get the product from John for the same price as Alice's offer, rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a better price with her or buy from John."
