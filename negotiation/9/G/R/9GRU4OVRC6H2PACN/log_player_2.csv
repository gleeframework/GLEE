Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $800,000, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he can get the product from John for $800,000, Alice's offer of $850,000 is still within his budget of $800,000, and it's better than negotiating further with Alice."
