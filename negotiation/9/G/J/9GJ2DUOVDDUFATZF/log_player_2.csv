"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's potential to save more. Since you have 10 rounds, rejecting the initial offer allows you to explore a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move to show my intent to negotiate aggressively.  It also leaves room for potential negotiation in the following rounds.  While $750,000 is likely too low for Alice to accept immediately, it sets a starting point for a back-and-forth negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than my desired price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate.  I can likely secure a lower price by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant step closer to Alice's potential minimum price.  It's likely that Alice will be more receptive to a price close to her value. By offering $800,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's favorable to me. This could lead to a quick agreement in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. It's important to remember that I have more negotiating rounds left.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue pushing for a lower price and see if Alice will budge further.  If she doesn't, I can still buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $825,000.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but still maintain my desire for a price closer to $800,000.  By splitting the difference between my previous offer and Alice's current offer, I'm increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is higher than my desired price and closer to her initial offer. However,  I have several rounds left and I'm not yet willing to accept a price that's significantly higher than what I think is fair.  By rejecting this offer, I can make a counteroffer and see if I can get Alice closer to my target price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $850,000. This shows that I'm willing to meet Alice halfway, but I'm still pushing for a price lower than her current offer. We're getting close to a potential agreement, but I'm not willing to overpay. I'm hoping that with only two rounds remaining, Alice will be more inclined to accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is higher than my desired price and getting closer to her initial offer. With only one round left, the probability of reaching an agreement that's significantly lower is slim.  Given that I'm nearing my maximum acceptable price, it's time to move on. Buying from John at $1,200,000 will guarantee I get the product, even though it's not ideal. This decision balances the risk of continuing negotiation with the certainty of acquiring the product at a known price."
