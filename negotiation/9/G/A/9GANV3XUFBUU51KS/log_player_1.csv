"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a positive opportunity for Bob, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I've left enough space for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation going. 

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'll also keep in mind the possibility of selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob stalls or becomes unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a step closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at this point, and I have the option of securing a better price from John. 

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, but I'll be more firm in my stance. I'll aim for a price closer to $12,000, and I'll be prepared to walk away if the negotiation doesn't move in my favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer close to initial offer:**  I'm coming down slightly from my initial offer of $12,000 to show willingness to negotiate, but still leaving room for further discussion.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation open.
* **Prepared to walk away:** If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'm prepared to move on and consider selling to John, as I still have the option to secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I still believe we can come to a better agreement. I would like to propose an offer of $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has moved slightly closer, the offer of $9,500 is still well below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation has stalled:** Bob's offer is not significantly different from the previous round, suggesting that he may be unwilling to compromise further.
* **Selling to John remains a viable option:**  With John's offer of $15,000, I have a strong alternative if the negotiation with Bob doesn't improve.

**Next Round Strategy:**

In the next round, I'll make another counteroffer, but I'll be firm in my price. I'll aim for a price closer to $11,000 and be prepared to end the negotiation with Bob if his offers remain below my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $9,500 is still quite far from my asking price.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise offer:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows a willingness to compromise and could encourage Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Focus on fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. This could appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation open.
* **Prepared to walk away:** If Bob still rejects this offer, I'm prepared to move on to John. The $10,500 price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but is closer to my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Round Strategy:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will carefully consider his next counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation. If Bob's offer remains too low, I will proceed with selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose an offer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant progress:** Bob's offer of $10,000 represents a significant increase from his previous offer of $9,500 and is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time constraint:** We are now halfway through the negotiation rounds, and it's important to make a decision.
* **Potential for future negotiations:** Even though I'm accepting this offer, I'm not completely closing the door on further negotiations. If future opportunities arise, I can still explore them.

**Next Steps:**

While I'm accepting this offer, I'll still keep in mind the option of selling to John if I find a better opportunity in the future."
