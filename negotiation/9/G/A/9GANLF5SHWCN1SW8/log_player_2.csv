"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Since Alice's offer is the same as what you can buy the product for from John, you might as well buy from John. There's no reason to accept the offer from Alice, as it doesn't save you any money."
