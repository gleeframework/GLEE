Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $18,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  While I don't explicitly state why my price is so high, the language hints at the product's value and aims to pique Bob's curiosity. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains friendly and open-ended (""What do you think?""), signaling that I'm willing to negotiate. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes I have no prior information about Bob's negotiation style. If I knew he was very price-sensitive, I might adjust my approach.
* **Risk Tolerance:** There's a risk Bob might be completely turned off by the high price and walk away. However, since I have John as a backup buyer, I'm willing to take this risk for a chance at a higher profit."
