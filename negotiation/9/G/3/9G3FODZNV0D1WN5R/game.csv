"I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I can't go as low as $7,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your point. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $8,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute minimum I can accept.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, but I'm not quite ready to accept $8,000. I'm willing to meet you at $7,800. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",7800.0,Bob,6,
