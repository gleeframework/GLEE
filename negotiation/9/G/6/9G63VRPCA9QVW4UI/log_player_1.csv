Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob still sees value in the deal. 

Here's why:

* **My profit:**  If Bob accepts, I earn $2000 more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Bob's gain:** He gets the product for $1000 less than its worth to him.
* **My risk:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John and earn $12,000."
