"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  $900,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $750,000 right now.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I pay $825,000?  I'm really serious about buying this product and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're serious about buying the product, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $825,000. I'm thinking of a price of $835,000. This is the closest I can get to meeting you in the middle without losing too much on the deal.",835000.0,Alice,5,
