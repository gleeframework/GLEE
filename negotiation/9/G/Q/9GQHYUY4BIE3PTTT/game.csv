"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value the product holds for you, while also being a reasonable profit for me.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's my firm limit.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your firm limit, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,5,
