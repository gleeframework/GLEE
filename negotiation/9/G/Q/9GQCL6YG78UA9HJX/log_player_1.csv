Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows her product's minimum value and John's guaranteed purchase. This allows her to start negotiations with Bob at a strong position, aiming closer to the product's true worth to her.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $950,000 offer isn't ridiculously high. It leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and for Alice to potentially lower the price slightly while still remaining significantly above Bob's perceived value and ensuring a profitable outcome. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""immense value"" to entice Bob and justify the high price. 
 
**Overall Strategy:**

Alice is employing a strategy that balances her minimum acceptable price with the potential to maximize her profit if Bob is willing to pay more than his perceived value."
