Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $175. This gives Bob a potential bargain, but also leaves room for negotiation if he's willing to pay more.  I'm confident that I can get at least $150 from John if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $160 is better than selling to John for $150. While I would have preferred my initial price, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation."
