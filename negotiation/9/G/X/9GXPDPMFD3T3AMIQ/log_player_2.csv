"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  Rejecting and counteroffering is the best strategy to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but the value of this product is truly significant.  Let's meet in the middle - I propose a price of $1,850,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the inherent worth of what I'm offering.

Alice's offer is still higher than your budget. You can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your goal of $1 million."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  However, I need to be closer to  $1,500,000 to make this work on my end. My final offer is $1,600,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the potential this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and it's unlikely you'll be able to get her down to $1 million. You've negotiated as much as you can. It's time to cut your losses and go with John's offer."
