"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $13,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer.  He has a significant buffer ($2,000) before needing to go to John, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still in a good position to negotiate.  He can likely get the price down further, as Alice is already willing to compromise.  There's still a significant gap between $11,500 and his ideal price point, so rejecting and countering makes sense."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,500 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
