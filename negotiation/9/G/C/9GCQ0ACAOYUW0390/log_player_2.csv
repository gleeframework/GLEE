"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering. It makes sense to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need it to be closer to my budget.  How about $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counter-offer is intentionally low. It establishes a negotiation range and leaves room for compromise. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is respectful but makes it clear that the initial price is unacceptable.
* **Aiming for a Deal:** While John offers a fallback option at $8,000, there's still potential to get a better price from Alice with skillful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her current offer is still higher than what John is offering. You have some room to negotiate, so it's worth seeing if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  How about we settle at $7,000?  That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer aims to split the difference between Alice's last offer ($9,000) and your previous offer ($6,000), but leaning slightly more in your favor.
* **Testing the Waters:** By going for $7,000, you're gauging Alice's willingness to go lower. 
* **Still Above John's Offer:** This offer acknowledges that you're willing to pay a premium over John's price ($8,000) to potentially secure a deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I think we're getting close, but $7,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on a price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your target price! There's no point in negotiating further or going with John, as you've now secured the product at the best possible price."
