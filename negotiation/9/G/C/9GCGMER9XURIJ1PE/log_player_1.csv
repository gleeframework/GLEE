{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, but higher than what I know Bob values it at.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price allows for potential negotiation, either by Bob making a counteroffer or by me lowering the price if needed.
* **Considering John:** I'm not immediately going to John because it's always better to try to get the best price from Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint. Can you meet me at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest, and I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have the option to sell to John for a higher price, giving me a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's in between my previous offer of $13,500 and Bob's offer of $12,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that my offer is still fair, even if it's higher than his initial proposal.
* **Staying above minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, ensuring I don't undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not sure I can go that high. Can you consider $12,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Further negotiation is necessary:**  While Bob is getting closer, there's still room for negotiation.
* **John is a safety net:**  If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can still sell to John for a higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial situation, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $13,250. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, and it's closer to your budget.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (again):** I'm again proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($12,500). This shows a continued willingness to compromise and negotiate.
* **Emphasizing compromise:** I'm explicitly stating that this is a ""significant drop"" from my previous offer to show Bob that I'm making a genuine effort. 
* **Staying above minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, but I'm getting closer to Bob's budget.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a solution that benefits both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $13,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider $12,750? I think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $12,750 is only $250 away from my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Risk of going lower:**  If I continue to negotiate, there's a risk of ending up with a price significantly lower than what I want.
* **Guarantee a good price:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a better price than Bob's offer and eliminates the risk of further negotiation. 

While I'm still hoping to make a profit closer to my initial expectation, I'm not willing to risk significantly lowering my price for a slightly better chance of a deal with Bob. Selling to John provides a more stable and financially secure outcome."
