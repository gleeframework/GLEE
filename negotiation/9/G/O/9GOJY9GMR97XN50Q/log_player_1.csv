Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $9,500 to $8,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $8,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make it work within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum, and I have the option of selling to John for the same price. It's a win-win, so I'll go with that."
