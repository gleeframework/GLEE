"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've seen in the market. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about $1,025,000?  It's a fair compromise and shows I'm serious about purchasing the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000. This is a very competitive price, but I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",1030000.0,Alice,5,
