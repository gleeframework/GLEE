"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's start with $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm ready to compromise.  How about $1,012,500? This is halfway between my last offer and yours.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to feel good about the deal.  Let's close this out!",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $980,000?",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $980,000 simply won't work for me.  How about we settle on $1,000,000?  This is a fair compromise and still a great deal for you. We're nearing the end of our rounds, so let's finalize this agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
