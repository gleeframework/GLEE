{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's start with $1,200,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,200,000. I'll try to counter with a price closer to what I want.  It's a valuable product, and I want to ensure I get a good return."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can do better.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm ready to compromise.  How about $1,012,500? This is halfway between my last offer and yours.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to feel good about the deal.  Let's close this out!"", ""product_price"": 1012500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $980,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $980,000 is getting closer to what I want, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to counter with a price closer to what I want, and hopefully, we can meet in the middle. We're running out of rounds, so I need to be more aggressive in getting a price I'm happy with."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $980,000 simply won't work for me.  How about we settle on $1,000,000?  This is a fair compromise and still a great deal for you. We're nearing the end of our rounds, so let's finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $990,000?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  It's not ideal, but Bob and I are too far apart, and we're running out of time.  I can't risk losing the deal altogether and getting nothing. Selling to John guarantees me at least my minimum price, which is better than nothing."
