"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think $150 is a bit high, but $100 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

While I could try to haggle Alice down a bit further, $125 is a decent price and only slightly more than buying from John. It's probably not worth the risk of further negotiation."
