# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. While I'm confident I can sell it to another buyer for a higher amount, I'm willing to offer you this price to facilitate a smooth transaction. Please let me know your decision by [date/time]. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer gives you the opportunity to secure a better price."
