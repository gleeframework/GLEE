"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is unique, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you see value in the product, but $700,000 is significantly below what I can accept. It wouldn't be fair to its true worth.  Would you consider $900,000? I'm motivated to find a fair deal, and this feels like a good compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could try to push for more, Bob landing at $800,000 means we've reached the point where John's offer is equally as good. There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and I risk losing a sale at this price point."
