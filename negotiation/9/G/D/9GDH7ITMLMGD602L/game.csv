"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While $800,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to secure a deal closer to $700,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $750,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value is worth $1,000,000 to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
