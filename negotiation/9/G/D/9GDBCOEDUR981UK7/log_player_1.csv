Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, as I want to maximize my profits.  I'll gauge Bob's interest based on his response and adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'll try to counteroffer with a price that's more appealing to me while still remaining competitive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,500 is a little lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $14,000? It's a fair price that still allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $13500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle for it. I believe I can get a better deal with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. $13,500 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,750? This price reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $13750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13500, and that's my final offer. Please let me know if you can accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is very close to my desired price and also represents a significant improvement from his previous offers.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale rather than risk getting a lower price or having to sell to John for a lower price."
