"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer immediately. You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for the same price. It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price, even if it's just to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($800,000) is a good strategy. This shows you're serious about negotiating and leaves room for a compromise.  A 25% reduction is substantial, but still within the realm of reason.  It will be interesting to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than the $600,000 I offered. I believe I can still get a better deal. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if I can get her closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but staying below Alice's current offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price. By moving closer to her offer, I hope to signal that I'm serious about buying the product and encourage her to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price range, but I'm still not willing to accept it. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can get a better price. I want to see if I can push her lower, especially since we're already halfway through the rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 675000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer again, but still staying below Alice's current offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us. We're getting close to a deal, but I'm not willing to pay Alice's full asking price yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is getting very close to my maximum price point, and we're nearing the end of the rounds. Accepting the offer at $725,000 is a good compromise, saving me $75,000 compared to buying from John.  There's a risk that Alice will reject my next offer, and I might be forced to buy from John at the higher price."
