"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in buying it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Can you meet me at that price?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $125. How about we meet at $118? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",118.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still looking for a compromise, Bob. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer the product to you for $127. It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",127.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one last adjustment, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $127 is the best price. I'm willing to meet you at $122, and that's my final offer. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",122.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're still looking for a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $128. It's the minimum I need to make a profit, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If not, I'll have to consider selling to John for $120.",128.0,Alice,7,
