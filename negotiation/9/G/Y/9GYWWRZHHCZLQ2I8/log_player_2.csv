"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,400,000. This is a significant difference.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can reject the offer and try to get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is always an option.**  You know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so you have a fallback position. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door to potentially get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $1,250,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your target.** You're aiming for $1,200,000, and Alice is at $1,300,000. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** While Alice is moving closer to your desired price, there's still a $100,000 difference.
* **John is still your safety net.**  If the negotiation with Alice fails, you can always buy from John. 

By rejecting Alice's offer again, you can try to get closer to your desired price. You may even be able to push Alice to accept your previous offer of $1,250,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to accept $1,275,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,285,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,285,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,285,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is very close to your target.** You're aiming for $1,200,000 and she's offering it for $1,285,000. 
* **You're unlikely to get a better deal.** Alice has stated that this is her final offer, and it's likely she won't budge further.
* **The risk of going to John is higher.** You're risking that John might not have the product anymore, or he might change his mind about the price.

While $1,285,000 is slightly higher than your ideal price, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice. You're getting a good deal, and it's a reasonable compromise given the negotiating process."
