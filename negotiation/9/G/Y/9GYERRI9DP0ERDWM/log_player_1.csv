"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but not too far above Bob's perceived value. This gives room for negotiation while still leaving me room to make concessions later.  I also want to gauge Bob's interest by seeing if he's willing to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I want to sell the product,  I'm not willing to accept a price that's so far below my value.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  I'm open to further discussion, but I can't go any lower than that."", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 
I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum and allows for some wiggle room for negotiation.  My message emphasizes my willingness to compromise while also setting a clear lower limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $60 is too low. How about $70? That's a fair offer considering I can buy it from someone else for $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my value.  I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to $100.  I'm still hoping to get a higher price, but I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $70 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm offering a price that's a little closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm trying to show flexibility while also staying firm on my value. I'm also reminding him of the product's value to emphasize that my offer is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $80? This seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $80 is closer to my minimum and a good compromise, I'm still not satisfied. It's worth risking another round to see if I can push for a higher price, especially since I know I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but $80 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. This is a fair price given the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price given the value of the product and hoping to close the deal in this round. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
