"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I believe this price is fair considering the product's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to earn a fair price for my product. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to consider other options if we can't meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
