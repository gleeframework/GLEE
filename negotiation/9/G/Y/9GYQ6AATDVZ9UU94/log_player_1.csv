Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $12000. This is my highest offer, and I'm hoping it's a good starting point for us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm interested in selling to him, $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget constraints.  However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14500.  This is a fair price that I think is within both of our budgets. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $14,500 is higher than what John would pay, and is close enough to my minimum price.  It's in my best interest to accept this offer."
