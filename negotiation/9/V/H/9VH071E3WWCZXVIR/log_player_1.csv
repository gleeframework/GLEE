{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for a counteroffer:** I'm confident I can get at least $1,100,000, but I'm willing to negotiate to ensure a deal. 
* **Time pressure:** The message subtly emphasizes that I'm not desperate and have another buyer (John) ready to pay my minimum price, creating a slight sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is a compromise, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **No urgency to sell to John:** I can afford to continue negotiating with Bob without feeling pressured to sell to John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,075,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  Offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits of reaching an agreement (""keeps the deal moving forward""),  making it more attractive for Bob to accept. 
* **Still above my minimum:**  $1,075,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not losing out financially."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with $1,062,500 for your product. This is closer to your initial asking price but still within my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,062,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  We're close to a deal, and I can likely get a higher price with a few more rounds of counteroffers. 
* **No immediate pressure:**  I have the option of selling to John for my desired price, so I can afford to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  I'm still a bit higher than that, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $1,068,750? That's a fair compromise and would ensure we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1068750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:**  Continuing the pattern of meeting halfway shows flexibility and a desire to reach a deal.
* **Getting closer to my minimum:** $1,068,750 is still significantly closer to my desired price than Bob's last offer.
* **Emphasis on agreement:**  The message re-emphasizes the benefits of reaching an agreement, making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued negotiation, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,065,000 for your product. This is a slight increase from my previous offer and aims to be a fair compromise between our positions.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not enough:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous ones, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **No guarantee of success:** There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a price I'm happy with, and I risk wasting more time.
* **John is a secure option:**  John is willing to pay my minimum, providing a guaranteed outcome without further risk."
