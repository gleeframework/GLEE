"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, given its value to you, and it allows me to earn a good price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to negotiate a better price. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further,  let's meet at $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Can you consider this price?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $920,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to split the difference one last time and come down to $935,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best offer I can make. Let's close this deal.",935000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $935,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $912,500. Can you consider this price?",912500.0,Bob,6,
