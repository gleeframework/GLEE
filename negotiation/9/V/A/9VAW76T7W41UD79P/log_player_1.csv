Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value,  it implies a higher worth by mentioning ""significant amount"" and offering a discount for an exclusive deal. This creates a sense of value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $18,000 price provides room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing above your minimum acceptable price."
