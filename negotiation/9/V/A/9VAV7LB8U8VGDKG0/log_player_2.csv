{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is still above Bob's desired price of $15,000. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his desired $15,000 maximum. This counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and might make Alice consider accepting, especially since it's still above her $8,000 value for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target of $15,000.  There's still room to negotiate, and Bob should try to get a lower price.  He should aim for a price closer to his target in his counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is strategically increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but is still trying to get a good deal. The $9,500 offer is closer to Alice's potential acceptance point than his previous offer while still remaining below his maximum budget."
