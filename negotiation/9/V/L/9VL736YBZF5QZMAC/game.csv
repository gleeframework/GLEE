"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1800000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise while staying within my financial limits.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're trying to find a balance, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $2100000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not comfortable going further. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers and propose a final offer of $2250000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",2250000.0,Alice,7,
