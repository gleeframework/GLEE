"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $15,000 from John, so there is no reason to accept Alice's offer of $12,000. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, a counteroffer of $10,500 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than her initial offer and still above Bob's target price of $15,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if a more agreeable price can be reached before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, a counteroffer of $11,000 is a good starting point. It's a compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's last offer.  It leaves room for further negotiation, but also shows Bob's willingness to make a move towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,550
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,550 is still too high for Bob.  Since Bob has a backup option to purchase the product from John for $15,000, it's now in his best interest to buy from John.  This decision is based on the fact that Alice's negotiation strategy seems to be inching upwards, making it unlikely that she will come down to a price that Bob is willing to accept."
