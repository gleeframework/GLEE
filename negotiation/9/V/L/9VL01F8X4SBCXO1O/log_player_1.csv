Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product has equal value to both you and Bob, and you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you have room to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value without explicitly mentioning why the price is above Bob's perceived worth. This encourages Bob to consider its potential beyond his initial valuation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The fact that you have another buyer (John) is not mentioned.  Revealing this information might weaken your negotiating position."
