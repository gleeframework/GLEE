"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. There are still rounds left, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows that the product is worth $8,000 to him and that John is willing to sell it at that price. By offering the minimum, Bob establishes a clear starting point for the negotiation and puts pressure on Alice to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. Since there are still several rounds left, Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay $8,000, but he knows that Alice won't accept that offer. This time, he offers $9,000, which is a compromise between his maximum price and Alice's last offer. This shows that he's serious about buying the product but also that he's not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, he's still not willing to pay that much.  He's only willing to spend $8,000, and there are still several rounds left in the negotiation.  He should keep trying to push Alice lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already offered $9,000, and Alice rejected it. He's unwilling to go any higher, but he knows Alice won't accept $8,000. By reiterating his previous offer, Bob is showing that he's committed to a price around $9,000, but he's not willing to budge significantly. This strategy puts the pressure back on Alice to make a decision."
