Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $9,000 is well below my minimum.  I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm happy to sell it to you for $10,500. This is a great deal for both of us, and allows you to still get it for less than its value to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,250. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $10,250 is a fair compromise. It's above my minimum of $10,000 and still leaves Bob a good amount of value.  I'll take it."
