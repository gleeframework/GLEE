"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. Considering the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $14,000. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $16,500. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $15,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a reasonable profit and me a good deal. What do you think?",15250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $15,250. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $16,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",16000.0,Alice,5,
