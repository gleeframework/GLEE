"I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,200. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $10,200 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is my final offer. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but $10,500 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm close to walking away from the deal, Bob. I've already had to make several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I can offer it to you for $10,800. This is my last offer. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,7,
