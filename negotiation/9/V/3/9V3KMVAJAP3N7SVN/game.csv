"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer to you. I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more in line with my minimum requirements. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $775,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. After reconsidering the product's value, I'm willing to make another counteroffer to you. I'm proposing a price of $825,000. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
