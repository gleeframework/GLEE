"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further.  $105 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50? ",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $107.50 is closer, it's still below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try $109.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to other options.",109.0,Alice,5,
