Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price, as this is the highest I'm willing to go.  I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation. I'm also aware I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum, so I don't need to settle for less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering $1,100,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product at a higher price.  We're closer to a deal with this offer, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still lower than my initial asking price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's also a significant improvement from his previous offer.  With John as a backup buyer, I feel confident that I can get a good price, but I don't want to risk losing Bob completely."
