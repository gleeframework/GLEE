Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1200000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for a bit more to reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This is a significant concession on my end, but I believe it's fair considering the potential this product offers. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.
