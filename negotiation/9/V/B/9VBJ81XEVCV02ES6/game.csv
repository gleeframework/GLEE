"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something we could discuss?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1200000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for a bit more to reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This is a significant concession on my end, but I believe it's fair considering the potential this product offers. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, and I'd like to propose a 2% discount on the total price if you accept this offer. That would bring the price down to $1184000. Is that something we can agree on?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the offer you've presented. While I value the potential for this product to benefit you, I'm still not quite there on the price.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $1275000. This reflects both the value I place on it and the need to meet your budget. This is my final offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
