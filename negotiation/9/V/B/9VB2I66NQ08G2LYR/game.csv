"Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $8,500. I'm willing to come down slightly to $11,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer, as I can easily get the product from John for $8,000. Let's see if we can make a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
