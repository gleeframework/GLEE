It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice has made it clear she's not going to budge much from her $14,750 offer. You've gotten very close to your maximum budget, but continuing the negotiation is unlikely to get you a price you find acceptable. Buying from John guarantees you get the product and save the most money."
