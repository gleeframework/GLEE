While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach a number that makes continuing negotiations worthwhile. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000 which is a significant profit compared to the trajectory of Bob's offers.  It's time to cut off negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
