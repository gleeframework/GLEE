"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do think it's a great product, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,500?",5500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $5,500 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This would still give you a great deal on the product and allow us to reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,5,
