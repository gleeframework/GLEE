"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to match this price later on.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2000000 is significantly more than my budget allows. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $500000 for it. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can find common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price more like $1200000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still outside of my range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $500000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget limitations.",500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. This is a significant compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $700000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget limitations.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $700000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,7,
