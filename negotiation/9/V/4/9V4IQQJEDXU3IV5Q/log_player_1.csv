"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this offer reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired selling point. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value and potential,"" aiming to anchor Bob's perception at a high level.
* **Strategic Positioning:** While the initial price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it's still within a reasonable range considering your minimum acceptable price and the potential for negotiation over multiple rounds. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts, you secure an excellent deal.
2. **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  It allows for concessions in later rounds, demonstrating a willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate your valuation, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. I am willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's a substantial increase from his perceived value, accepting at this point would be leaving a significant amount of money on the table. 

You have ample room for negotiation and the security of John's offer. It's strategically advantageous to counter-offer and work towards a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between our valuations is still quite significant. I'm open to finding a compromise, but I can't accept a price that low.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer and expresses a willingness to negotiate, fostering a positive atmosphere.
* **Strategic Concession:**  While the price reduction is substantial ($300,000), it still keeps the offer well above both Bob's initial offer and your minimum acceptable price.
* **Anchoring:** Suggesting a ""middle ground"" aims to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired range. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Test Bob's Flexibility:**  This counteroffer will reveal how serious Bob is about purchasing and how much he's willing to budge. 
2. **Maintain a Strong Position:**  You're still negotiating from a position of strength, leaving room for further adjustments if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I'm glad we're narrowing the gap. Considering my financial situation, I'd like to propose a price of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and represents a significant profit. While you could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, the difference is now relatively small, and there's a risk that Bob might withdraw his interest if he feels pressured. Accepting this offer secures a favorable outcome."
