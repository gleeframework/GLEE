"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the value I need to consider. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, I'm firm on $1,000,000.

Let's finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, his offers are still too low.  It's better to secure the $1,000,000 from John and avoid further negotiation."
