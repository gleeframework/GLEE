"I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900,000 is still below the value I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for the incredible value this product offers. Let's work towards a final agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, I'm firm on $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the immense value this product offers. It's the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.  Let's finalize this agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
