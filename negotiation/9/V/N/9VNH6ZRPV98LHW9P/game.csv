"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $17000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $17000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $16500? I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering.",16500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $16750? I'm confident you'll find the product worth that investment, and it would allow me to reach a more comfortable price point.",16750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but $16750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further. How about $16200? I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering, and I'm getting close to my maximum budget.",16200.0,Bob,6,
