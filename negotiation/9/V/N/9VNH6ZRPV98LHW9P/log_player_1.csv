"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $15,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $12,000, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $17,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $17000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $16500? I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $16,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to counteroffer Bob again in hopes of reaching a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $16,750? I'm confident you'll find the product worth that investment, and it would allow me to reach a more comfortable price point."", ""product_price"": 16750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point, but $16750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further. How about $16200? I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering, and I'm getting close to my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $16,200 is above my minimum threshold and I'm happy with the deal. I believe it's better to close the deal now than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price."
