Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since Bob can buy the same product from John for exactly his budget, it's more efficient to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
