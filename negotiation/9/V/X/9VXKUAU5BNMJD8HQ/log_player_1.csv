Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is much lower.  How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. Let's meet in the middle - how about $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair compromise.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $12,000 is still quite a way from where I need to be.  I'd be willing to accept $14,500.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a certain price, but $14,500 is still out of my budget. I can go up to $13,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Explanation: While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach the $15,000 mark I can get from John. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale."
