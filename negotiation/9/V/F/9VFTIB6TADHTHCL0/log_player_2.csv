**Reasoning:** Alice has met us back at our previous counter-offer of $10,750.  While we might be able to push her a little further, it's getting riskier. Continuing to negotiate aggressively might annoy Alice, and we're already getting a significant discount from John's $12,000 price. Accepting now is a good balance of risk and reward."
