"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm prepared to offer you $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still beneficial for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  This represents a significant savings for you compared to your initial price and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $980,000 for the product. This represents a significant savings for you and gets us very close to a deal. Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",980000.0,Bob,6,
