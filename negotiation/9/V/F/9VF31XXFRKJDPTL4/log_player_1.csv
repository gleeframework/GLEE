Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  $95 is above your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $100, so he has some wiggle room to negotiate a price that's beneficial to both of you. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is still a good price for Bob since it's below his valuation of $100, and it's closer to my desired price point. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge much further. While $82 is still above my minimum, I don't see much room for further negotiation.  John is a reliable buyer, and I'm comfortable selling to him for $80."
