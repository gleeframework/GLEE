Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal on something I know you'll find valuable."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get the highest price possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 (John), I can aim higher with Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $14,000 asking price represents a significant 40% markup. While this is ambitious, it leaves room for negotiation while still being profitable.
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and presenting the price as a special opportunity rather than an open negotiation.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves some risk. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll have to settle for my backup plan with John at a lower profit. However, the potential for a higher return makes this risk worthwhile."
