"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need at least $1,250,000 to make this deal work. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price is fair considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
