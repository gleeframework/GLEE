Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Maximizes Profit:** This price aims to capture a significant portion of the value gap between your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000).
* **Strong Chance of Acceptance:**  While leaving some profit for Bob, it's still a very attractive price for him considering he values it at $1,500,000.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000, ensuring you don't lose money."
