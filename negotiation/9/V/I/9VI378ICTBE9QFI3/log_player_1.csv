{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $175. It's worth much more to me, but I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This allows room for negotiation while maximizing my potential profit. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum price of $150.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
