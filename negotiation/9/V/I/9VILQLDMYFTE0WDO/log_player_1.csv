"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a bit high to me.  How about we start the negotiations at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to make the best deal possible, accepting a price that far below its value to both of us doesn't make sense.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move things forward, I can go down to $900,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price. I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, which is a good sign. $700,000 is still too low, but I'm getting closer to a point where I might accept. I'll counteroffer again to try to get closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer!  I can see we're both motivated to make this deal work.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price acknowledges the value you're gaining while fairly compensating me for the product."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting close!  I think we can close this deal now.  How about $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

This is getting very close to my minimum, but I have a good feeling Bob will go a bit higher.  I'm willing to risk one more counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're a tough negotiator, I'll give you that!  Let's wrap this up.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, my final offer. This is a fantastic deal for you considering what you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While your final offer is tempting, I'm afraid I can't meet that price.  To be fair to us both, I propose a final offer of $775,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

It's time to cut my losses.  Bob is unlikely to reach my $800,000 minimum.  Selling to John ensures I get a fair price without further negotiation risk."
