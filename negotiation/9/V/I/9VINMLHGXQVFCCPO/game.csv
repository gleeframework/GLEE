"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $850,000. Could you consider that?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $850,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for something a bit higher to make this worthwhile for me. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $825,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $850,000, which would represent a fair compromise. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
