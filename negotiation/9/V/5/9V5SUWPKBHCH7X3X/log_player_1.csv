Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:** I know I can get $800,000 from John, so that's my baseline.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he won't pay more than that.
* **Finding the middle ground:** Offering $1,000,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation for Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
