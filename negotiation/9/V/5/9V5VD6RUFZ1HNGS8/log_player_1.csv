"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. "", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than what I know it's worth to Bob but still gives me a good profit.  I'll see if he's willing to bite, and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $110 is a bit high for my budget.  How about $95? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. He's clearly interested, and I want to see if I can push him a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $102.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground that's still profitable for me but also appealing to Bob.  This way, we can hopefully close the deal without needing to go through too many more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$100 is a good price for me, and Bob seems very serious about closing the deal. It's not my ideal price, but it's more than what I would get from John. I'm confident that I can still make a good profit from this sale."
