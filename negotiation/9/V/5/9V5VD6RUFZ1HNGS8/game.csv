"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $110 is a bit high for my budget.  How about $95? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $102.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. ",102.5,Alice,3,
