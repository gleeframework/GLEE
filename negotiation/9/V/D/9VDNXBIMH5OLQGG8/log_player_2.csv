"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $10,000 from John, and Alice's offer is still too high. By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so offering $9,000 is a reasonable starting point. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still potentially profitable for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,250 is a better deal than buying from John for $10,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price from Alice, and he risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer is the most practical choice to ensure Bob gets the product while saving some money."
