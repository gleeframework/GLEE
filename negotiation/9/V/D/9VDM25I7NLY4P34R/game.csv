"That's a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $170 to be comfortable with the sale. How about we meet in the middle at $155?",155.0,Alice,5,
