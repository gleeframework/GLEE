"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that. I'm offering $1,100,000 as a fair compromise. This still gives you a significant discount, and it's a price I can comfortably accept.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
