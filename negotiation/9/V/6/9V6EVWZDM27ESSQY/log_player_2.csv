"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize my return on investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your valuation of the product and my minimum acceptable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,150,000 is still higher than your target price of $1,000,000.  You can likely still negotiate a lower price, as you're willing to pay $1,050,000.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,125,000 is still above your target price of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, you've already reached the point where further negotiation might be unproductive. 

Given that you have a guaranteed alternative with John who is selling the same product for $1,000,000, it's in your best interest to take that deal.  You'll save yourself time and effort, and secure the product for the price you initially aimed for."
