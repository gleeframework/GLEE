"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to discuss this, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize my return on investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your valuation of the product and my minimum acceptable price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This price is fair considering both of our needs and allows us to reach an agreement. Let's try to close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
