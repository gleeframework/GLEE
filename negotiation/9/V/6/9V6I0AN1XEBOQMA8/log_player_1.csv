Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (""given its value..."") makes the offer seem less arbitrary.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning that you'll list it publicly implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act soon.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I started at $10,000, I'm willing to negotiate down to a price closer to $8,000 if Bob counters. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still ensuring the sale, as I have John as a backup buyer."
