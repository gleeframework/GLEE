Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. It's a great product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my desired price and I'm confident I can get closer to my target. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  I'm sure you'll agree that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's a great price for a great product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $8,250 is still a good deal for me, especially considering the risk of losing the sale to John or continuing to negotiate with Bob with no guarantee of a better offer."
