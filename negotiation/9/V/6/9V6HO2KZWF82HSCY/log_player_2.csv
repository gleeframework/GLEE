"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80).  There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $100. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to come down to $115, which is closer to my target price of $100.  However, there's still some room for negotiation. I'll reject the offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about $110? That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to meet you at $112.50. That's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll consider it a done deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $112.50 is very close to my counteroffer of $110.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to get me a significantly lower price.  It's better to accept the offer and avoid the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer or me having to buy from John at a much higher price."
