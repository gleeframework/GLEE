Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $15,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 offer:** This is a significant discount from my personal value of $15,000 but still above Bob's estimated value of $8,000. This gives Bob a good incentive to buy while still leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **Open communication:**  I've started with a friendly message to build rapport and make Bob feel like I'm open to negotiation. 

By starting with this offer, I'm aiming to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** Does he bite at this price, or does he counteroffer? This will give me insight into how serious he is.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I have room to drop the price if needed, but I'm not starting at a point where I'm immediately losing money. 
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** If Bob rejects my offer and I don't feel like negotiating further, I can still go with John's guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and am willing to pay $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my personal value of $15,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who's willing to pay my desired price. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Negotiate further:** I can try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **See how determined Bob is:**  If he's truly interested, he'll likely counteroffer again.
* **Maintain my option to sell to John:** This gives me a safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still looking for something closer to $11,500. If you're still interested, let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by dropping my price from $12,000 to $11,500. This demonstrates flexibility while still staying above Bob's initial offer.
* **Reasoning:** I've provided a reason for my counteroffer, stating my desire to find a price that's fair for both of us. This keeps the negotiation focused and respectful.
* **Open door for further discussion:** I'm ending the message with a positive tone, suggesting we can still reach an agreement. This encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:** Hopefully, $11,500 is a price that both Bob and I can be happy with.
* **Keep Bob engaged:** By leaving room for more negotiation, I'm keeping Bob motivated to continue the process.
* **Maintain my leverage:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I can still move forward with John's offer or potentially even lower my price slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am willing to consider $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved up to $11,000, which is very close to my counteroffer of $11,500.  Considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $15,000, I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal.  

Here's why:

* **Close to my goal:** $11,000 is within a reasonable range of my desired price, making it a good deal.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and energy, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better price.
* **Avoiding risk:** While John's offer is higher, it comes with the risk of Bob changing his mind or finding another seller.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good price while minimizing the potential for further complications."
