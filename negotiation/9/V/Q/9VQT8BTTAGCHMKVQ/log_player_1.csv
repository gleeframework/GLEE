Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's a fair price considering your minimum value, and it leaves room for negotiation.  The message is friendly and positive, hoping to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $80.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $70 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $75. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum value of $80.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing a sale.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum value, so it's the best decision in this situation."
