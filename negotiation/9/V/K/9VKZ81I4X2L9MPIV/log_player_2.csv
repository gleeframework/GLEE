Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is a good price, lower than John's offer and closer to your desired price point. Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly lower price, but it's not worth risking the deal. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you get the product at a price that is within your budget and saves you a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
