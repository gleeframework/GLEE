"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $13,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000.  Let me know your decision, as I have another buyer lined up for $10,000 if you decline. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing:**  While Alice claims to have another buyer for $10,000, it's likely a tactic to pressure you into accepting the $13,000 offer. 
* **You have leverage:** You know John is a guaranteed seller at $15,000.  This gives you room to negotiate with Alice.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal you're not willing to overpay. She might come back with a lower price closer to her $10,000 valuation.

**Strategy:** By rejecting this offer, you're aiming to see if Alice will budge on her price and offer a better deal. If not, you can always fall back on John's $15,000 offer."
