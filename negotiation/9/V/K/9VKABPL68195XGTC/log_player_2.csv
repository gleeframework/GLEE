"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $130. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $130 is a bit too close to your maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

We're starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation. This approach might encourage Alice to engage in a back-and-forth to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from your offer. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to your desired price range, but there's still room for negotiation. Let's try to push for a slightly lower price before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about $115? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you agree."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

This counteroffer aims for a price closer to your target while demonstrating willingness to compromise. By stating you're ""ready to buy,"" it adds a sense of urgency and potential closure for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close, Bob! I can see we're almost there. How about we try $122? It's a tiny bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly signaling that she's reaching her limit, and $122 is a good price, saving you $28 compared to John's offer. It's unlikely you'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point."
