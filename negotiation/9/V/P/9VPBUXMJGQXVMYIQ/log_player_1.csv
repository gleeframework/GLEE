Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $120 as possible. Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $120, there's no need to go below that.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80, so offering it slightly above his valuation might entice him while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $110 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
