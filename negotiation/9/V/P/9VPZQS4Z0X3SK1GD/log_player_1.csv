Round 2
Bob's offer:

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to your budget, it's still a significant gap from my minimum.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,025,000, but that's my final offer. This provides a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is consistently moving towards a fairer price. However, I'm still leaving a significant amount of money on the table if I accept his current offer.  It's worth one more counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap further."

Round 8

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer at $1,009,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  We're unlikely to get much higher than this from Bob. He's consistently splitting the difference, and further haggling might irritate him.
* **Time Value:**  Every round spent negotiating is a risk. The longer this drags on, the more likely Bob is to walk away or for an unforeseen issue to arise. A deal now is better than the uncertainty of a slightly better deal later.
* **Profitable:** $1,009,000 is still a significant profit. Holding out for an extra few thousand might not be worth the risk of losing the sale altogether."
