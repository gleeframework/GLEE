"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but $900,000 is significantly below what I can consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This offer reflects my effort to find a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to your budget, it's still a significant gap from my minimum.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,025,000, but that's my final offer. This provides a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
