{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is only worth $10,000 to you.  Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is too high.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a lower price than what the product is worth to me ($10,000) to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This is a significant discount from her initial offer and should encourage her to consider it."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject the offer and continue to negotiate for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still offering a price higher than what the product is worth to me. Although she has come down to $11,000, it's still not worth risking further negotiation rounds.  I will continue to try and get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm finally offering Alice the price that the product is worth to me. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to pay more.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that Alice will accept it.  If she doesn't, I'll be happy to buy the product from John for the same price."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is only $500 lower than what John is selling the product for. At this point, it's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. There's a good chance she won't budge further, and I could end up with no product and wasted time. I'll go ahead and buy the product from John to ensure I get it for a fair price."
