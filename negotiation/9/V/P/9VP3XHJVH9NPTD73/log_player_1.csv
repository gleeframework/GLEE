Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving Alice leverage in the negotiation with Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
