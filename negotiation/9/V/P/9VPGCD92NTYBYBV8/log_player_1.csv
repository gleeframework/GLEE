Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Knowing its value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  If Alice starts too high (e.g., $1,450,000 or more), Bob might be immediately turned off and less likely to negotiate.

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale with Bob, who offers a higher potential return than John."
