"Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your initial asking price. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,
