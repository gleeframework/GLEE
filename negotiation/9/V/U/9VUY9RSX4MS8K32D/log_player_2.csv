Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this revised price strikes a more balanced compromise while reflecting the significant value this product offers. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
