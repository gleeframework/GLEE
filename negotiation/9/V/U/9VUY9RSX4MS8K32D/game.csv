"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of $600,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the current market and my specific needs for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this revised price strikes a more balanced compromise while reflecting the significant value this product offers. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. This product would need to fit within a tighter budget for it to make sense for me. I could consider a price closer to $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,4,
