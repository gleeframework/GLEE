Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a good starting point.** It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures you make more than your minimum of $15,000. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** It highlights the potential for a good deal for both parties, making Bob more likely to engage.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Congratulations! You've successfully sold the product.
* **If Bob rejects:** Analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer. 
* **If the negotiation drags on:** Remember, you can always sell to John for $15,000.  This provides a safety net and helps you avoid losing too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  While it's tempting to take the $12,000, I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Selling to John for $15,000 is a safe and profitable option.** However, I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price range before going with John.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob with a price higher than his offer of $12,000, but still lower than my initial offer of $14,000. This approach aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **I'm trying to find a middle ground.** $13,000 is a compromise between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. 
* **I'm still above my minimum acceptable price.** I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000, so $13,000 is a reasonable counteroffer.
* **My message is still friendly and encourages negotiation.** I want to show Bob that I'm open to finding a solution that benefits both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! The deal is closed.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll have to consider his counteroffer carefully.  I can either accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer. 
* **If the negotiation drags on:** I'll always have the option to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand your position, I still believe that $12,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope you can consider this and let me know if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob has remained firm on his $12,000 offer.** This indicates he's unlikely to budge further, and I'm unwilling to go below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a good profit.** This is the safest and most profitable option available at this point. 

**Reasoning:**

While continuing to negotiate with Bob is possible, it's unlikely to yield a better price.  By selling to John, I avoid the risk of further negotiation and secure a satisfactory profit."
