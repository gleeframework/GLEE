"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $15,500. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're getting closer to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $13,000.
