{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum value. 
* **Message:** It's friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  While it's less than my ideal price, it's still a significant profit.
* **Avoid a stalemate:** By offering a reasonable price, I increase the chances of Bob accepting and avoid the risk of getting stuck in a long negotiation.
* **Keep John's offer in mind:** If Bob rejects, I can use John's offer as leverage in subsequent counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $11,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* While it's tempting to take the $11,500 and avoid further negotiation, I'm confident I can secure a better price through further rounds of negotiation.
* By rejecting Bob's offer, I can leverage John's offer of $15,000 in subsequent counteroffers."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you're working within a budget, but considering the value of this product, I'd be willing to go down to $13,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to meet my own needs.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $13,000, which is halfway between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a fair deal.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints, but emphasize the value of the product and highlight the benefits of accepting this counteroffer.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer is a calculated risk. It balances the need to get a good price with the possibility of pushing Bob away. However, by being reasonable and communicative, I'm increasing the chances of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $11,500 is a bit low for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $13,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  While it's closer, accepting it would still mean losing a significant amount of money.
* **I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.** Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and I'm confident I can push him further towards a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John remains a viable option.**  If this negotiation doesn't yield a better price, I can always sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I meet my minimum requirement.

**I will make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better deal from Bob.**"

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,250 is still a bit too low for me. I understand your budget constraints, but this product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you.

* **Message:** I reiterate the value of the product and emphasize the significant compromise I'm making. I appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and try to build trust by highlighting the mutual benefit of this deal.
