Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start high.  A price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Value-based language:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, rather than just stating a price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message doesn't sound like an ultimatum. It allows Bob to counter-offer if the initial price is too high.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this high price. You might need to adjust your approach based on Bob's response and any information you gather about his willingness to pay."
