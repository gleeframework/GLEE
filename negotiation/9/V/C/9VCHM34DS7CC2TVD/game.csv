"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is already a competitive price for this product. It offers significant value that justifies the cost. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could you consider $12,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I can't go as low as $12,000, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000? ",14000.0,Bob,6,
