"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this unique and valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and engaging in this negotiation.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm motivated to find a solution. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. Let's split the difference again. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  How about $1,200,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal without further negotiation.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
