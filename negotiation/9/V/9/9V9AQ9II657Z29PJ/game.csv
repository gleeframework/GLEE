"I have a great opportunity for you, Bob. This product is a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $5,000? That's a fair starting point for negotiation.",5000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,12000.0
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of a price of $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we try $7,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,11000.0
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we meet at $11,000? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",11000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're not making much progress here. I'm willing to offer $7,500, but that's my absolute best. If that doesn't work for you, I might have to explore other options.",7500.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,12000.0
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. I'm starting to think that's the lowest I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,7,,
