Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of a price of $10,000. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we meet at $11,000? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is not budging much from her initial offers.  It's time to show her we're serious about a lower price or we'll walk away.  We're getting close to John's price, and we need to make Alice aware that she's in danger of losing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're not making much progress here. I'm willing to offer $7,500, but that's my absolute best. If that doesn't work for you, I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** This counteroffer shows we're serious about a lower price while still being reasonable.
* **Slight increase:** The small increase from $7,000 to $7,500 shows willingness to compromise, but not by much.
* **Introducing an alternative:** Mentioning ""other options"" reminds Alice that we have the option to buy from John for $8,000. This might push her to accept or make a more competitive counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. I'm starting to think that's the lowest I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is unwilling to budge below $11,000.  She even hints at ""other options,"" suggesting she might be willing to walk away too.
* **Time pressure:** We're approaching the end of our 10 rounds, and there's no guarantee Alice will come down further.
* **Guaranteed Savings:** John's offer of $8,000 is a sure thing. Waiting longer with Alice risks getting stuck at a higher price or even having her walk away.

It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed savings."
