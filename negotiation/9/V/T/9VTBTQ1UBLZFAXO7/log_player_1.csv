{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he wants the product badly. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down a little, selling at $12,000 or slightly less is a considerable profit compared to John's offer of $8,000.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he is for the product. If we had more information, we could potentially refine the offer further."
