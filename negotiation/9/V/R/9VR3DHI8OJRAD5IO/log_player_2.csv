"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal by counter-offering. There's no risk in rejecting since you can always fall back to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to acquire this product for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1350000. This price is still below my initial offer but reflects the potential I see in this product for you. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $1,500,000 to $1,350,000. This is a significant price reduction and a good deal for you.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice will not go much lower, and you could risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting her offer is the most sensible choice to secure the product at a favorable price."
