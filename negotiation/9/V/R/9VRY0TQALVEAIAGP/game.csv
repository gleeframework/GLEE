"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your understanding of the product's value. I'm willing to be flexible, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and is a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  Let's try to bridge the gap further.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows us to close the deal and makes this a worthwhile purchase for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
