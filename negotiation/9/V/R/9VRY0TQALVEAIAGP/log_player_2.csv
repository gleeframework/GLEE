# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, but she's offering it for $1,100,000. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and your understanding of the product's value. I'm willing to be flexible, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and is a win-win for both of us.

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price. Bob should try to negotiate further to get a price closer to his maximum budget of $800,000."
