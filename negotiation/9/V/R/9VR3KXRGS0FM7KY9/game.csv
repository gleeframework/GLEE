"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Is there any flexibility on your end to meet me in the middle?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1500000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1800000. This is my final offer for now, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1700000. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm excited about the possibility of working with you.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you halfway at $1700000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm thinking of $1900000. This is my best offer for now, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target, but $1900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1600000, which is my final offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",1600000.0,Bob,6,
