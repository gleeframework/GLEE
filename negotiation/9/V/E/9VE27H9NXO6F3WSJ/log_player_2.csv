Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, I have to prioritize my own needs, and $8,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $14,000 for this product. It's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from her last offer.  She's still quite far from my $8,000 maximum. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
