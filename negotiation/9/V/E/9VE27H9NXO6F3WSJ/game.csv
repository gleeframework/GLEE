"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about we settle somewhere around $8,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, I have to prioritize my own needs, and $8,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $14,000 for this product. It's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,5,
