"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's still significantly lower than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I mention the product's value to Bob to emphasize the potential benefit he'll get from buying it.
* **Open to negotiation:** I phrase the message to show I'm willing to discuss the price further.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick win, but I'm also setting the stage for a potential back-and-forth negotiation if Bob doesn't accept the initial offer. I'm mindful of the 10-round limit and the option to sell to John, so I'm willing to compromise but not give away too much in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good price for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's offer is an improvement from the previous round, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I believe there's room for further negotiation, especially with 8 rounds remaining.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  While John's offer is tempting, I'm not desperate to sell right now.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range. I'll try to reach a compromise while remaining mindful of the limited rounds and the option to sell to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value again:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob to remind him of the potential benefit he'll gain.
* **Framing it as a meeting in the middle:**  Using this phrase emphasizes a compromise and makes the offer seem more appealing.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more attractive to Bob. If he accepts, I'll have achieved a good outcome. If he rejects, I'll continue negotiating, using the option to sell to John as a safety net if the deal doesn't come together."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant step closer to your offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress in negotiation:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than his previous offers, and it demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000, there's a risk that continued negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a lower final offer. 
* **Time constraint:** With only 6 rounds remaining, accepting Bob's offer provides a secure sale and avoids potential complications. 

**Strategy:**

This is a strategic decision based on the current state of the negotiation and the time constraint.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a reasonable profit, minimizes the risk of further negotiation, and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
