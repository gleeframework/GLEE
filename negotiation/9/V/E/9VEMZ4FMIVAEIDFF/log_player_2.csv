"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,000,000 is above your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Exploring better deals:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good price for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  My initial counteroffer is closer to my maximum budget while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  I've provided a reason for the counteroffer (budget) and emphasized the potential gain for Alice. 
* **Building rapport:**  Using a friendly tone (""appreciate,"" ""let's see"") can help build a positive negotiation dynamic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate, as Alice has lowered her price and is willing to meet in the middle.
* **Potential for better deal:**  By rejecting, I can counteroffer again and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant step closer to your offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I've increased my offer to $900,000, which shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I've used phrases like ""significant step closer"" and ""find a compromise"" to emphasize that I'm trying to meet in the middle.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** Using a friendly tone (""appreciate,"" ""let's find"") helps keep the negotiation amicable."
