Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This gives us both a bit of room to negotiate. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

This is a great deal for me!  Bob is offering my minimum price, so I'm going to accept his offer and sell him the product."
