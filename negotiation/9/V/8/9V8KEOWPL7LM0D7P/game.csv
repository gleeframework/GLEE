"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $950,000 is too low. How about we settle at $1,000,000 even? This seems like a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $1,000,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but no higher. Can you meet me there?",975000.0,Bob,6,
