Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be worth more than Bob's valuation. 
* **Anchoring:** By offering a high initial price, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to your asking price than his initial perceived value.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower your price, but don't go below your minimum of $15,000."
