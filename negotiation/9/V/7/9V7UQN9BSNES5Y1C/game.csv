,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Can you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $7,500 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer, so please consider it carefully.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're sticking to your price, but I'm still holding firm on $8,500. I really need to make at least that amount to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",8500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a good profit, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $8,500, which would be $8,250. Can you consider that?",8250.0,Bob,8,
