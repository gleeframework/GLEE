Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm asking for $2,250,000.  Let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value but avoids being too specific. This allows room for negotiation while piquing Bob's interest.
* **Urgency:**  By mentioning a limited-time opportunity, we encourage Bob to decide quickly, potentially preventing him from overthinking or lowballing.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims high, hoping Bob might accept the initial price. If he rejects it, we can negotiate down, knowing our bottom line is $1,500,000 (from John). This approach gives us the best chance to secure the highest possible profit."
