"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I agree the product is valuable, that starting price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,050,000 and go from there?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. It seems we both see the inherent value in this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair compromise that reflects its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
