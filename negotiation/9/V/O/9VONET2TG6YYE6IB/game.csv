"Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your confidence in its potential. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $950000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $975000.  This reflects the significant value this product brings and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I've reviewed my budget again and am willing to increase my offer to $960000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial limits. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",960000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $960000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $965000.  This compromise would allow both of us to move forward with a successful transaction.  What do you think?",965000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $955000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's try one more time to find a solution.  I'm willing to come down to $960000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of this product while also being within your financial reach.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal in the next round.",960000.0,Alice,7,
