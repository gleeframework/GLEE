Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's a good strategy to start with a high price, as you can always go lower. 
* **Being Open to Negotiation:** This makes you seem more flexible and willing to work with Bob.
* **The ""Amazing Product"" Line:**  This hints at the value of the product without revealing your own minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!  You've earned $18,000.
* If Bob rejects, you can analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to:
    * **Accept:** If his offer is close to or above your minimum.
    * **Reject and Counteroffer:** If his offer is too low, try to meet in the middle. 
    * **End Negotiations:** If you feel his offer is too far off, you can always sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe $12000 would be a fair price for it based on my budget and the market value. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is the Minimum:** While $12,000 is your absolute minimum, you have leverage because John is also willing to pay that amount. 
* **Opportunity to Negotiate:** Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially increase the price. You can try to meet Bob halfway or counter with a slightly lower price than your initial offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* You should counter Bob's offer with a price higher than $12,000, but lower than $18,000.  For example, you could offer $15,000. This shows you are willing to negotiate, but still value the product higher than Bob's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being upfront with your budget. While I value the product higher, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $15,000? That's a fair price considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to work with Bob while still aiming for a price closer to your initial valuation.
* **Value Proposition:** Reminding Bob of the product's value helps justify the price.
* **Open Ended:**  Ending with a question keeps the negotiation open and encourages Bob to respond. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** You've made a successful deal at a price that's above your minimum.
* **If Bob Rejects:**  Analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to:
    * Accept: If his offer is close to $15,000 or higher. 
    * Counter: If his offer is still too low, you could counter with a slightly lower price.
    * Sell to John: If Bob's offers continue to be significantly lower than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the value I perceive in the product, I would like to propose a price of $14000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $15,000. This is a good deal, considering your minimum is $12,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal altogether is higher.  It's not worth the risk of potentially selling to John at a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

* Accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. You've successfully negotiated a price above your minimum and secured a sale."
