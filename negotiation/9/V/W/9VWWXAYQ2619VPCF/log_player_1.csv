This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum, while still leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to start high and be prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sacrifice my minimum profit margin."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you want to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable. I need to maintain a profit margin, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.  I will counteroffer again."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?
