"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  It doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you want to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that.  However, $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a good compromise, and it allows us both to make a decent deal. Let's close this deal and move forward.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",960000.0,Bob,6,
