"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product. I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  The message is friendly and inviting to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Open Ended:**  The message ends with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he isn't, I'll be prepared to lower the price in subsequent rounds, but I'll always keep in mind the $80 minimum I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is at the absolute bottom of my range.  I'm not desperate for a sale, and there's still room to negotiate a better price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Hold Out:**  I want to see if I can secure a higher price. I'm willing to risk losing the sale to John to see if I can get more from Bob. 
* **Counter-Offer:**  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  How about we split the difference? I'd be willing to come down to $90.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the ""good deal"" aspect and highlights my willingness to ""split the difference,"" making the offer more appealing.
* **Open-ended Question:** I end with an open-ended question to keep the conversation going and encourage Bob to respond.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer while still demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  By offering a ""middle ground"" price, I hope to entice Bob into accepting the deal and avoid the risk of losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $5 away from my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're already in round 4, meaning we're getting closer to the 10-round limit.  If I reject this offer, I risk running out of time and having to sell to John for a lower price.

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and secures a profit.  I'm willing to compromise to avoid potential losses in subsequent rounds."
