"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($80) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value Bob will get, increasing the likelihood of him considering the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer allows for multiple rounds of negotiation if needed. 
* **Protecting My Minimum:**  $100 is still above my minimum of $120, ensuring I don't lose money if I have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to buy it for $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Keeping options open:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the option to counteroffer and potentially reach a higher price or sell to John if negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** Offering $95 shows I'm willing to negotiate while staying above my minimum. 
* **Positive and encouraging:** Using a phrase like ""meet in the middle"" suggests a willingness to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Maintaining leverage:** $95 is still closer to my desired price, keeping the pressure on Bob to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $95 is still a bit high for me.  How about $90? Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Exploring better options:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the option to counteroffer again and potentially reach a higher price.
* **Time is on my side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to explore if Bob is willing to go higher or to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $92? It's a fair compromise and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  Offering $92 represents a smaller compromise than before, showing I'm getting closer to accepting his offer.
* **Emphasizing a deal:** The message emphasizes a ""fair compromise"" and closing the deal, putting pressure on Bob to agree.
* **Testing the waters:**  Offering $92 will reveal if Bob is genuinely willing to compromise or if he's just trying to bargain as low as possible.
* **Time is still on my side:** I still have 5 rounds to go before needing to make a final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground.  $92 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $91.  Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on the Minimum:**  While $91 is still below my ideal price, it's only $1 away from my minimum acceptable price of $90.
* **Limited Time:** We're in round 6, and I have a limited number of rounds left. 
* **Potential for Counter-Offers:** If I reject, Bob might counter with $90, which would be my minimum. However, there's also a chance he might not counter, leaving me with nothing.
* **John's Offer:**  While John offers a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale with less risk.

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer for $91 is the most strategic choice at this point."
