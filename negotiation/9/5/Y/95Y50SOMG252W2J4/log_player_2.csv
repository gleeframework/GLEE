"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, but I need to make a fair profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. 
* While Alice claims the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy it for less.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move to John and secure the lower price."
