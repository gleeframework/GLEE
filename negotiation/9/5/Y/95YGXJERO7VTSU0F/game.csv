"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $800000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $700000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $650000. This is a fair offer, and I believe we can find a compromise at this price.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700000 and $650000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $675000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
