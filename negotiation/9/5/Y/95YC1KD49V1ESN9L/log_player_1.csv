Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly more than my minimum desired price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he has some incentive to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $13,500. This is a compromise that's closer to my desired price, but still leaves some room for negotiation, as Bob clearly values the product at $15,000. I believe this is a fair counteroffer that might encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $12,000 is still significantly better than selling to John for $10,000. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
