"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you first dibs on this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  It makes sense to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $800,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range. It's a significant jump down from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation and keeps me well below both her starting price and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $800,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, $1,300,000 is still above your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate further down towards John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle at $950,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

This counteroffer moves closer to a potential agreement while still leaving space for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price point that's appealing to me but also allows Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming to sell this product close to its actual value, and $950,000 falls short of that.  To be fair to both of us, how about we settle at $1,150,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and at $1,150,000 it's still above your $1,000,000 limit.  It's now more beneficial to cut negotiations and buy from John at your target price."
