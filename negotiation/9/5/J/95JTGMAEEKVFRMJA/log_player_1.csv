Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire it before anyone else. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($18,000 vs. $12,000), we leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a price higher than his initial valuation. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and existing interest creates a sense of scarcity and desirability, making the price more palatable. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, we don't lose out.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This strategy assumes we have some flexibility to negotiate with Bob. If he's known for being a hard bargainer with a firm walk-away point, we might adjust our initial offer.
* **Relationship Building:**  While aiming for the best price, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is crucial, especially if future business opportunities are possible."
