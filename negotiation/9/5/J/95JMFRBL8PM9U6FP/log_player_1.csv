I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're getting close to a deal with Bob, but it's taking too many rounds, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get him to my desired price point.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to risk getting a worse deal with Bob."
