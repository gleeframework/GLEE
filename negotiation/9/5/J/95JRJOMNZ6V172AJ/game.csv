"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's get this done!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $700,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to make this work.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still a bit far off. How about $775,000? That's a significant move on my end.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $775,000 still isn't close enough. I'm willing to drop to $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,6,
