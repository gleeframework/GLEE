"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about $1,350,000?  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,325,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
