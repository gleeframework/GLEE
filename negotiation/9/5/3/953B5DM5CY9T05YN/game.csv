"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $15000 for this product.  What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $15000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13500. I think that's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,
