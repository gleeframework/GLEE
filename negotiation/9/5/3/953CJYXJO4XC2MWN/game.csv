"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is considerably below its true value. This product delivers exceptional returns, which is why I'm offering it at $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this compromise?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  However, the value this product brings is undeniable, and $950,000 doesn't reflect that.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,000,000. This is my best price, and I believe it's a fair deal given its potential.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
