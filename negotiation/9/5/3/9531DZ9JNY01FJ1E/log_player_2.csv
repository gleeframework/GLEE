"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is below her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can negotiate a better price or simply proceed with your backup option and save $150,000."
