"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations, potentially worth even more to you than it is to me. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,450,000. What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product is valuable, that initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table, but that offer is significantly below its true value and my initial ask was already very fair.  To move this forward, I could consider a price of $1,350,000. This reflects the product's significant worth while still offering you a potential gain.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still finding it hard to justify a price point above $1,200,000.  Would you be open to meeting in the middle somewhere?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
