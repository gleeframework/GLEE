Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations, potentially worth even more to you than it is to me. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,450,000. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product is valuable, that initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and closer to John's standing offer.  I need to steer him upwards.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table, but that offer is significantly below its true value and my initial ask was already very fair.  To move this forward, I could consider a price of $1,350,000. This reflects the product's significant worth while still offering you a potential gain."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still finding it hard to justify a price point above $1,200,000.  Would you be open to meeting in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tough spot. Bob is now matching John's offer. I'm not sure I can push him much higher.
