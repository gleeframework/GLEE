Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you to find a price that works for both of us.  $885,000 is a good offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on this product.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has labeled this as her ""final offer"" and is unlikely to go much lower. While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller and we risk jeopardizing the deal.  $895,000 is a reasonable price compared to our $1,200,000 alternative with John."
