# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a steal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high. He can get the product from John for $800,000, saving himself $100,000."
