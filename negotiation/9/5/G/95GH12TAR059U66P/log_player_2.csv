"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. My initial offer is $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds to make a deal, so there's time to work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to pay $750,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious intent to purchase but also your financial limitations.
* **Fairness:** The price is still above Alice's minimum of $800,000, leaving room for potential negotiation and a win-win scenario.
* **Justification:**  The message provides a reason for the counteroffer (budget) and highlights the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $750,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $850,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point.  You have more rounds of negotiation left, so you can continue trying to lower the price.  

**Next Steps:**  A counteroffer slightly above your target price of $800,000 would be a good strategy.  Perhaps offer $825,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and $850,000 is closer to where I need to be. However, I'm still working with a tight budget.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to make a reasonable deal. "", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. $825,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $850,000, but I'm willing to make a small concession to $840,000 to seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

**Next Steps:**

A counteroffer slightly above your target price of $800,000, like $810,000 or $815,000, would be a good strategy for the next round."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $810,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one final concession to try to get the deal done.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate with me.  I understand your position and I'm happy to make a final offer to close the deal. I'm willing to go up to $805,000 for the product.  This is the best I can do, and it allows both of us to come to a mutually agreeable outcome. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options, as I'm running out of time."", ""product_price"": 805000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This signals that you are making your last effort to come to an agreement.
* **Close to Target:** The offer is just $5,000 above your target price, showing you are serious about acquiring the product.
* **Leverage:** You are reminding Alice that you have a backup option (buying from John) if the deal doesn't close.
