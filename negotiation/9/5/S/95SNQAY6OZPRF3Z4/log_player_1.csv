``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him a sense of getting a good deal while still allowing you to earn a decent amount.  By leaving room for negotiation, you can potentially reach a price closer to your minimum target of $10,000.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price point. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a price that's so far below my minimum. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price that's more reasonable."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9000 is closer, I'm still only able to offer $8750 at this time. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it fair. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm not desperate to sell, and John is willing to pay my minimum. I'll counter Bob one more time, but if he doesn't budge, I'll move on to selling to John."
