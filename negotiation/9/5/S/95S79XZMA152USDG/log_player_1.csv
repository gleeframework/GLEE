Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $910,000 is a good step forward, but I'm still looking for a price that more accurately reflects the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $915,000.  This is a fair price that reflects a compromise and gives us both a chance to benefit from this deal. Let's close this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 915000}
```

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm making a small concession by lowering my price slightly, but staying above Bob's last offer.

* **Value Reinforcemen:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, reinforcing that my offer is still very fair.

**Rationale:**

At this stage, it's important to find a balance between being firm with my price and showing a willingness to compromise.  By making a small concession, I'm signaling that I'm serious about making a deal with Bob, but I'm also holding firm to my minimum acceptable price.  The goal is to encourage Bob to accept my offer before we reach a point where I have to sell to John and lose potential profit."
