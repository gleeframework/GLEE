"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you highlighting the uniqueness of the product. However, $15000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $13500. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
