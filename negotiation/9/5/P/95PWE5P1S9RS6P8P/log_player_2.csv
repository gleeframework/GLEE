# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering,  $11,500 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I see you're serious about the product. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  $11,000 is closer to his target but still a bit high.  He can continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high.  Let's split the difference again - how about $10,750? That's a fair compromise that keeps us both happy."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to come down slightly more, but I need to stay above $10,800.  Would you be willing to agree to $10,900? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is the closest she's come to Bob's target price of $10,500. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or even reject future offers.  At this price, Bob saves $1,100 compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer minimizes risk and secures a decent deal."
