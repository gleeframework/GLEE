Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but still lower than my minimum acceptable value of $120. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also ensures I get a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is a better offer than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject his counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's counteroffer of $90.  I believe this price is fair, considering that Bob has shown interest in the product and is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still lower than my ideal price, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. I believe it's in my best interest to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or the possibility of losing the sale altogether."
