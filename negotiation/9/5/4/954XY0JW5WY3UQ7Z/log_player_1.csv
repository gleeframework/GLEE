Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $1,500,000. She aims for a price significantly higher than her minimum ($1,200,000) to maximize her profit.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on Alice's risk tolerance and how much she wants to prioritize a quick sale, she could offer a higher price closer to $1,500,000."
