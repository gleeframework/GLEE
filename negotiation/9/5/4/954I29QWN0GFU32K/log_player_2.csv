# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I think you'll find this price very competitive. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than John's offer of $1,500,000. 
* **You still save money:** Even at $1,400,000, you're getting the product for less than your perceived value of $1,500,000."
