"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are trying to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than your desired price range.
* There's potential to negotiate further and get a better price.

**Next Steps:** You should make a counteroffer to Alice that is lower than $900,000 but still above her minimum value of $800,000. This will keep the negotiation moving and potentially lead to a price that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $900,000, giving you a good chance to save money.
* It's still above Alice's minimum value of $800,000, so there's a chance she will accept it.
* This counteroffer allows for further negotiation if Alice rejects, giving you more room to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is still higher than what you are willing to pay.
* You have already made a counteroffer and are in a position to potentially negotiate further.

**Next Steps:** You should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to your desired range. Consider a price slightly higher than your previous offer of $850,000 but still lower than Alice's current offer. This will keep the negotiation moving and potentially lead to a price you are comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest one.
* It shows you're serious about negotiating but still want a good deal. 
* It gives Alice room to bargain, potentially leading to a final price that is mutually agreeable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $975,000 is getting increasingly closer to your maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* You've already made several counteroffers, and it seems that Alice is not willing to budge significantly.
* At this point, buying from John for $1,000,000 guarantees you the product and avoids further potentially unproductive negotiations.

**Conclusion:** While you would ideally like to save more money, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially not reaching an agreement outweighs the potential savings. Buying from John ensures you get the product and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
