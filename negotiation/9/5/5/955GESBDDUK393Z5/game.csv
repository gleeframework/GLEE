"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Would you consider $130? ",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $170 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $145? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",145.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we try $142? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",142.0,Alice,5,
