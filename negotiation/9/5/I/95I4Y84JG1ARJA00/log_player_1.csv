Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. However, I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with the $1,000,000 price establishes a strong anchor. While it's Bob's maximum valuation, it sets the expectation high. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The phrase ""open to hearing your thoughts"" suggests a willingness to negotiate without explicitly saying so. This might encourage Bob to counter-offer within a range favorable to Alice.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice is secure knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 if Bob declines. This strong alternative allows Alice to hold firm on her price.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit.  Alice might leave some money on the table if Bob is willing to pay close to $1,000,000. However, it also minimizes the risk of losing the sale altogether."
