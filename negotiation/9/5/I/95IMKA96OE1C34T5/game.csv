"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000? I believe this would still provide significant value for my needs.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $750,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This price still offers you a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price point.  Let's keep the negotiation going and find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
