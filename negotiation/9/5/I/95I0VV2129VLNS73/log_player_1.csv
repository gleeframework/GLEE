Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys at your minimum.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,000,000 (your minimum) and $1,200,000 (Bob's maximum). Any price within this range could lead to a deal.

**Offer Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal. Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it's worth significantly more to you in the long run. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a bit of psychological pressure.
* **Value-Based Language:**  ""Unique value proposition"" and ""worth significantly more in the long run"" focus on Bob's potential gains, not just the price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while leaving Bob with a $50,000 incentive to buy from you instead of seeking alternatives.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Dynamic:**  Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate within the ZOPA, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Don't use John as a threat.  It's good to have a backup plan, but explicitly mentioning it could make Bob less likely to negotiate."
