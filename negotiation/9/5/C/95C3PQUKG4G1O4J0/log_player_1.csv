Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob is sensible.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product for a price between Bob's value ($1,000,000) and John's offer ($1,500,000) increases the chances of Bob accepting while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,400,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while making it clear to Bob that the offer is serious and time-sensitive."
