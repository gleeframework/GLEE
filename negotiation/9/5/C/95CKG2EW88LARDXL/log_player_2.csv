"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The offer is too good to be true:** $60 is significantly less than your maximum price of $120. This suggests Alice might be undervaluing the product.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** By rejecting, you can potentially get an even better price. 
* **Risk mitigation:** If Alice rejects your counteroffer, you can always fall back on buying from John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  A $45 counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer allows us to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially uncover how much she values the product.
* **Still leaving room for negotiation:**  If Alice rejects this offer, we can continue to increase the price in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice has moved from her initial $60 offer to $50, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Good Value:**  $50 is a good price, considering your maximum is $120, and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** There's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower offer in the next round. While you might save a few more dollars, the risk of losing the deal at a good price is too high."
