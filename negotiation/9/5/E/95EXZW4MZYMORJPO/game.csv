"I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to acquire a valuable product for a fair price. I believe our mutual interests align, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a little high. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice.  How about we settle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
