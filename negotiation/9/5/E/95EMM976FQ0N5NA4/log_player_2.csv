"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price from John.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower, so it's worth rejecting and counteroffering to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it aims to quickly establish a lower price range and gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  If she rejects this offer, I can adjust my counteroffer in the next round based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly higher than my counteroffer.  It's worth rejecting again and counteroffering to see if we can get closer to my desired price.  I'll likely adjust my counteroffer to be closer to $375,000, but still below it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price point. I'm counteroffering with $300,000, which is a reasonable increase from my previous offer and still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $350,000.  This is a good deal compared to John's price of $1,000,000. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting my offer and me ending up with John's much higher price is not worth it.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
