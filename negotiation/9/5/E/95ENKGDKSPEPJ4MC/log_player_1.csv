Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  Setting the price at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 provides a safety net. This knowledge allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Messaging:** The message uses positive language (""exclusive opportunity"", ""fair offer"", ""significant returns"") to emphasize the product's value and encourage Bob to accept."
