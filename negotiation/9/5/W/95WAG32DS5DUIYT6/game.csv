"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm counteroffering at $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
