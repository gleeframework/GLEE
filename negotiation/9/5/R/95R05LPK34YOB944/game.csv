,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it, but that's my absolute maximum. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1400000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1750000, considering the unique value of this product.  It's a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price point.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1750000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1600000. This is really pushing my budget, so I hope we can find common ground here.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $1650000. This is a compromise from my previous offer and very close to your proposed price.  I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1650000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1550000, which is the absolute maximum I can offer. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1550000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get at least $1550000 for the product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1575000. This is a small adjustment, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.  What do you say?",1575000.0,Alice,7,
