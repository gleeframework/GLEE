"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $825,000. This still represents a great value for you and allows me to get a fair price for my product. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. Can you consider this offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $775,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to keep the product in the market where it can be used to its full potential. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,5,
