"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our exclusive product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to maximize the value of this product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your seriousness in making a deal. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This would be a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,125,000. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer, and I believe this price reflects the value of the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a final compromise of $1,125,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
