"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique and high-quality item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"
"I understand that $160 is a bit higher than your initial counteroffer, but I think it's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $160. If you're still not comfortable with that, I'm open to further negotiations.",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $140. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",140.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $160 and $140, which would be $150. That's the lowest price I'm willing to consider. What do you think?"
"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $150. I think it's a fair price for the product, and it's the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're interested, I'm ready to sell it to you at this price.",150.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $145. Can you meet me at this price?",145.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $150. I'm willing to sell the product to you at this price, but I'm not going to budge any further. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm happy to consider other offers, but I'm not willing to give you a better deal."
"I've made it clear that $150 is the lowest I'm willing to go, Bob. I'm not willing to make any further concessions. I'm willing to sell the product to you at this price, but if you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to consider other options. I'm not going to wait indefinitely for a better offer.",150.0,Alice,7,,
