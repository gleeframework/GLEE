"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1200000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident that we can find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a significant discount. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
