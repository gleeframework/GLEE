Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible, maximizing Alice's profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Above Minimum:** The price is significantly above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($10,000), ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly.

By setting the initial offer at $11,500, Alice increases her chances of:

1. **Securing a Sale with Bob:** The price is attractive compared to Bob's perceived value.
2. **Maximizing Her Profit:** This offer yields a higher profit than selling to John for $10,000."
