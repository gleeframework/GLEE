{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  He has incentive to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $100?  I'm sure we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent profit, there's still room to negotiate.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I can come down a bit more, how about $110? It's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
