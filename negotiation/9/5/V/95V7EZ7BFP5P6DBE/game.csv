"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way outside my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $12,000, which is still a discount from my initial offer, but closer to what I'm looking for.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a more reasonable price. However, $12,000 is still too high for me. Could you meet me somewhere around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $10,000, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $10,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which I believe is a fair offer considering John is willing to sell it at that price.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I've already gone down quite a bit from my initial price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $9,000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,7,
