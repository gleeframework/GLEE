Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way outside my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. Would you consider $6,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $12,000, which is still a discount from my initial offer, but closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
