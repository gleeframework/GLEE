"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way outside my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us. Would you consider $6,000?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $12,000, which is still a discount from my initial offer, but closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a more reasonable price. However, $12,000 is still too high for me. Could you meet me somewhere around $7,500?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $10,000, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $10,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which I believe is a fair offer considering John is willing to sell it at that price.  Let me know what you think."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I've already gone down quite a bit from my initial price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $9,000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While we could try to push Alice further, there's a risk she won't budge below $9,000. Accepting this offer saves us $1,000 compared to John's price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
