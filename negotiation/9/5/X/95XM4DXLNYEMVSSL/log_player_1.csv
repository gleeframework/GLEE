Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for a profit, and $1,150,000 is well above your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **It's aggressive:**  By starting high, you set the tone for a potentially profitable negotiation.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your desire to close the deal quickly or maximize your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to maintain control and potentially secure a higher price through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial price and Bob's offer, showing your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still profitable:**  $1,100,000 still provides a good profit for you while leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Pressure:**  By counteroffering, you're putting pressure on Bob to close the deal, as he might be worried about losing the product if he delays further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is:

* **Higher than John's offer:**  This secures a better profit than selling to John.
* **A good compromise:**  It's a reasonable midpoint between our last two offers.
* **Minimizes risk:**  Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but there's also the risk of Bob backing out or making a lower counteroffer. Accepting this offer ensures a solid sale with minimal risk."
