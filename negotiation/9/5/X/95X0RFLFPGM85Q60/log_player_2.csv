"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to Bob, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $800,000."
