"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $100. This is an exclusive opportunity tailored for valued customers like yourself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better deal.  We should make a counteroffer significantly lower to give us room to negotiate towards a price closer to our $80 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but only if I can get it closer to $60."", 
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start significantly lower than Alice's offer to give us bargaining room. 
* **Leaving Room:**  While our target is closer to $80, aiming for $60 initially leaves space for Alice to counter and for us to potentially meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Polite but Firm:** We want to be respectful of Alice's time but also clearly communicate our budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle? I'll offer the product at $75 this time. I hope this works better for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to our desired price point, but we're still not at our $80 limit. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're looking for a slightly better deal and might encourage her to come down a little further. We're getting close, and a small counteroffer might seal the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and make it $70?  That would work for me."", 
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. It shows willingness to compromise.
* **Close to Target:** $70 is a good price for us, saving us $10 from Alice's current offer and $10 from our maximum budget.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  This offer might be tempting enough for Alice to accept, especially if she's eager to make a sale."
