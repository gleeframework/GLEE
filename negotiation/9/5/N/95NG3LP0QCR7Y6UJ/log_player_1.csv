Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product significantly higher than your minimum, we start with a strong offer closer to his perceived value. 
* **Justification:**  Framing the price around ""potential value"" and Bob's ""expertise"" makes it seem less arbitrary and more appealing.
* **Room for negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle, while still securing a substantial profit above your $800,000 minimum.
* **Alternative in mind:** We are aware that John provides a safety net, ensuring you won't be forced to accept any offer below $800,000."
