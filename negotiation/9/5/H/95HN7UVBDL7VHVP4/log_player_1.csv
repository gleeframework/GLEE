Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits"" to appeal to Bob's perception of the product's worth.

By setting the initial price high, but not unreasonably so, Alice increases her chances of securing a deal that significantly exceeds her minimum acceptable price of $800,000."
