# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $13,500.**  This is more than the product is worth to you ($15,000 maximum).
* **You can get the product from John for $15,000.**  This is your maximum budget. 
* **Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice.** You'll still get the product, but at a slightly lower price by buying from John."
