"Alice, thank you for the offer.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the best possible value.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I hope you'll find it reasonable.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
