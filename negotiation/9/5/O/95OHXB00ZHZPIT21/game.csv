"Bob, I have a very unique product that I believe will be of significant value to you.  I'm asking $1500000 for it, a price I believe reflects its potential.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the item, I believe $1200000 would be a fair price considering my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit low for me considering the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This price still leaves room for a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's potential. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product. However, given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet a price higher than $1250000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
