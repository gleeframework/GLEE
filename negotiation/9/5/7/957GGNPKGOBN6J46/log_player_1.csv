Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the negotiation. I'm willing to pay up to $10,000 for this product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
