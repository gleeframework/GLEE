Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This represents a substantial investment on my part and shows my commitment to acquiring the product.  Let's find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that. While $1,200,000 is closer to the mark, it's still below the product's true value. I'm willing to accept $1,700,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,700,000 is still higher than my budget, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product in my eyes. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we continue to work together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting close enough to John's standing offer that it's not worth risking the extra rounds of negotiation.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a significant profit and avoids the potential for the deal to fall through."
