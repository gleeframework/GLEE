"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1400000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still within your budget. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than that, so it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save $200,000."
