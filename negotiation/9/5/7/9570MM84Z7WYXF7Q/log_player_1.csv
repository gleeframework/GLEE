"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000.  I'm confident this price reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,300,000, we set a high anchor. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffers are likely to be influenced by this higher starting point.
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value is key to securing a good deal.

This strategy aims to maximize our potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value,  $2,300,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. This seems like a fair starting point for us to negotiate from. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is an option, it's too early to settle for our minimum. We have room to negotiate with Bob and try to close a deal closer to his perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This considers its potential and ensures a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, but Firmly:** We are making a significant concession from our initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. However, the new price ($1,900,000) is still substantially above Bob's offer and well within a reasonable range above our minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** We continue to emphasize the product's value, aiming to justify the higher price and potentially shift Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to a middle ground. We're hoping Bob will recognize our willingness to compromise and respond with a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for working with me. While $1,900,000 is closer, it's still a significant jump for me. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might:

* Become frustrated and walk away from the negotiation.
*  Not budge much higher than his current offer.

Accepting the $1,200,000 offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether.  It represents a successful negotiation outcome."
