"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $150.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $125 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is within your budget of $150 and closer to your target price than John's offer. It's a good deal for you, so accepting it makes sense."
