Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

This is a strong opening offer that aims to secure a good price for the product.  It's 200,000 above the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation, but still sets a high initial bar."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I need to consider his budget, I can't accept such a low price. It's better to continue negotiating and aim for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,250,000? This reflects both the value of the product and your budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,180,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still slightly below it. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,220,000, which is a significant compromise. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it should be within your budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1220000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,220,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's time to close the deal and secure this amount.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee of a higher price, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a satisfactory outcome."
