Bob can save $100,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and proceeding to the next round. There's a potential for even further savings if Bob can negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Buying from John immediately guarantees the product, but at a higher price.  

**Strategy:**

Bob should aim to negotiate with Alice to bring the price down as close as possible to Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000."
