Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. While I appreciate the value you place on it, I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I still believe we can find a more equitable solution. How about $1,600,000? This price takes into account both the value of the product and my budget constraints.

Even though Bob's offer is now above John's standing offer, we still have room to negotiate and try to get closer to our desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $1,600,000 is close, but I need to see a bit more movement.  How about we settle on $1,750,000, and we have a deal?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I've given this some more thought and am willing to consider $1,700,000 as a compromise. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

While we could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher and we risk him walking away.  Accepting $1,700,000 is a significant profit above our minimum and a good outcome for both parties."
