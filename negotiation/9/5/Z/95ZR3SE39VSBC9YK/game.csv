"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product. This still leaves room for you to get a good deal, and it's closer to a price we can both be happy with.  Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer.",11500.0,Alice,3,
