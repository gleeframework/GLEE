"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.  He knows he can buy the product from John for $10,000, so he has room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product. This still leaves room for you to get a good deal, and it's closer to a price we can both be happy with.  Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's revised offer of $11,500 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He knows he can buy the product from John for $10,000, which is a better deal for him. Therefore, Bob decides to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John."
