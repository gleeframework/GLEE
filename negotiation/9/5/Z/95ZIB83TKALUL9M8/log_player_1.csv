Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. My asking price is $140."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Asking for the full $150 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could scare him away."
