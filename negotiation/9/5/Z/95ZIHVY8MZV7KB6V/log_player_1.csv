"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000.  This is a bit of a gamble, but it allows for room to negotiate down if Bob counters.  I'll be prepared to adjust my price depending on Bob's response, but I want to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I believe I can get a better price. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still leaves room for some potential profit while being more reasonable than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is now offering my minimum price.  It's time to take the deal and secure the sale.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
