Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it would be a highly worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price and make it seem like a valuable opportunity.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price higher than your minimum. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Market Conditions:**  The offer assumes there are no other similar products readily available in the market.  If the market is competitive, you might need to adjust your pricing strategy."
