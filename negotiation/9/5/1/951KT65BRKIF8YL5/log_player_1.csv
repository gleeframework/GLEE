"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is still significantly lower than Bob's value but allows for room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob gets by highlighting the difference between my price and his perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message doesn't come across as rigid, implying I'm open to discussing the price further.

**Strategy:**

This first offer aims to:

* Gauge Bob's initial interest and willingness to negotiate.
* Establish a higher starting point to potentially reach a price closer to my desired outcome. 
* Leave room for concessions in subsequent rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $90? It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Further negotiation carries the risk of Bob becoming more stubborn or even rejecting future offers, potentially leading to a sale to John for a lower price.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 10 rounds, I need to be mindful of the time pressure. Accepting Bob's offer now secures a decent profit and minimizes the chance of a worse outcome. 

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I:

* Guarantee a profit of $10, which is better than selling to John for $80.
* Avoid the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even a failed deal. 
* Free myself up to potentially pursue other opportunities if time allows."
