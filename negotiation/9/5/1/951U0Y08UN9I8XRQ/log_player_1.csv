"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that will be worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is still lower than the value to Bob, allowing for room for compromise and a potential deal. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer in a positive way, highlighting the product's value and creating an inviting atmosphere for negotiation. 

**Strategy:** I'm hoping to gauge Bob's initial interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below the $1,000,000 minimum I've set for myself. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Selling to John is an option:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, which serves as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'll need to consider Bob's willingness to negotiate and the number of rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price that's above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my price and emphasize the benefits to Bob. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm keeping the tone positive and collaborative, inviting further negotiation.

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming to find a middle ground while still remaining within my desired price range. By showing flexibility and focusing on a win-win outcome, I hope to reach a deal in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,000,000 I'm aiming for. 
* **Remaining rounds:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price.
* **John as a backup:** Knowing I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me confidence to continue negotiating with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'll need to carefully consider Bob's negotiation style and the remaining rounds to determine the best approach."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 for this unique product. This is a fair price considering its value and the limited time remaining in our negotiations.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the minimum:** I'm finally offering my minimum acceptable price, making it clear that this is a serious offer.
* **Time pressure:** Highlighting the limited time remaining adds a sense of urgency and might push Bob to accept.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Strategy:**

This is a crucial round. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round. However, I'm hoping that by meeting him at my minimum, I can convince him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think the product is worth less than $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $25,000 away from my minimum. While tempting, it's not a significant enough increase to justify further negotiation.
* **Time Pressure:**  We are down to the last 4 rounds. With each round, the risk of not getting a deal increases. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees my minimum and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

At this point, securing a certain deal with John outweighs the potential for a slightly better price from Bob. The risk of losing both buyers by continuing to negotiate is too high."
