Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since I value the product at no less than $80, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 85}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $80. Since I value the product at no less than $80, I'm happy to accept his offer!
