"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $110.  Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $115?  It's still a good price for you, and it gives me a little closer to my asking price.",115.0,Alice,3,
