"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is lower than my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to sell the product for $950,000. This price reflects a significant value for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $950,000, which is still above Bob's ideal price but significantly lower than her initial offer and lower than John's price.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product for a price that is within his budget while saving $50,000 compared to buying from John."
