"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you at a price of $9,000.  This is a great deal considering its value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair compromise, and it still allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. While $8,500 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,250? I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
