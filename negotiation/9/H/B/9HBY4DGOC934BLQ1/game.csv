"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair compromise, and it still allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position. While $8,500 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,250? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
