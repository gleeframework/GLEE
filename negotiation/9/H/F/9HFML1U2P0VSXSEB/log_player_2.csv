"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price, considering your potential use for it.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is a bit too high. While it's less than your $15,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. This might encourage her to come back with a lower price, closer to her own perceived value of $8,000."
