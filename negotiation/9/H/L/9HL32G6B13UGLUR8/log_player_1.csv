"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's valuation, but it leaves some room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a good price.  I'm starting high, but I'm ready to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $15,000. While it's closer to my initial offer, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I hope it's a good compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired value.  This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling to him but also that I'm not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that.  However, $10,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is my final offer before I consider other options.  Let me know what you decide."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This is a significant concession on my part.  I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm nearing my limit.  I hope this will convince him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $15,000. With only 4 rounds left, the chances of Bob increasing his offer to my minimum are slim.  It's better to sell to John now and get the full $15,000."
