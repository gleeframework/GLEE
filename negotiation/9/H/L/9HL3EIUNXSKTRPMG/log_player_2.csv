You can likely get a better price from Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This offer is below your maximum price of $100, and leaves room for potential negotiation if Alice isn't willing to go that low."

Alice's offer is now within your price range and is a good deal.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll reject your counteroffer and you'll end up paying the same price from John.  Accepting the offer secures the product for a price you're comfortable with."
