"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $120, and Alice is offering $95.  While this is a decent price, you can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

You're offering a price of $85, which is $10 less than Alice's offer and only $5 more than what the product is worth to Alice. This is a reasonable counteroffer that shows you're serious about buying the product but still want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $90, which is still within your budget and a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. It's better than buying from John for $120.  There's a chance you could negotiate further, but it's likely you won't get a significantly better offer from Alice.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise and saves you $30 compared to buying from John."
