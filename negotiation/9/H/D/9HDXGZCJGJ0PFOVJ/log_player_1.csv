Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,000,000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good profit margin. 
* **Strong Message:** I'm emphasizing the uniqueness and value of the product to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation, which could encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm prepared to sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails. This gives me a safety net and leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).  There's a chance I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob's offer gives me a better sense of his perceived value for the product.
* **Leveraging My Position:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the power in the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price closer to $1,000,000, perhaps $950,000.  This shows flexibility but doesn't give away too much of my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $950,000. This reflects the product's unique qualities and my desire to reach an agreement.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between my initial price and Bob's offer. 
* **Maintaining Profit:** $950,000 is still a good profit for me while demonstrating flexibility.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's likely that further negotiations will be difficult and might not yield a significantly higher price.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he might walk away entirely, leaving me with only John's offer of $800,000.
* **Time Consideration:**  Continuing the negotiation might take more time and energy, and it's uncertain if it will lead to a significantly better outcome.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer of $920,000 secures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal.  While I would prefer a slightly higher price, the potential for a lengthy negotiation and the possibility of a lower final price make this a reasonable decision."
