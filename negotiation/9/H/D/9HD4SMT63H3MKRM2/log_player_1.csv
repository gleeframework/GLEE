Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights.  I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit if he accepts.
* **High but Reasonable:** $950,000 is a high price that reflects the product's value to me, but it's still a significant discount from Bob's perceived value of $800,000.  This might make him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and making the offer time-sensitive, I'm adding a touch of pressure and implying the product is in demand. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
