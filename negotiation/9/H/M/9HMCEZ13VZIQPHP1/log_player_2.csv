Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's above his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for less.  There's no reason to accept a higher price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay, and he can get the same product from John for $1,500,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or move on to John."
