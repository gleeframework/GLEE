"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and would allow for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know what you think.",1450000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,450,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum price.  I'm offering $1,600,000. This price still allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value of the product to me and the fact I have other options, I'm willing to pay $1,550,000.  This price is fair and allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
