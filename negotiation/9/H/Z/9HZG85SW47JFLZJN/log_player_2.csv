"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, Bob can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his $120 limit as possible, but also wants to stay within a range that's reasonable for Alice. Offering $105 gives a good middle ground, allowing for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still within Bob's budget of $120, and it's only $5 more than Bob's last offer. Accepting this offer is the best choice as it saves Bob money compared to buying from John and is a reasonable price for Alice.  Further negotiation may be possible, but the risk of losing the deal altogether outweighs the potential savings."
