"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $160, which I believe is a fair price considering its value."",
""product_price"": 160

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the maximum price he's willing to pay for the product. There's no room for further negotiation to reach a price that's beneficial for you. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John at your minimum acceptable price ($120), it's best to sell to John and avoid any potential losses from further negotiation with Bob."
