"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $150, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $180 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm going to counter with $190. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It's a reasonable middle ground that hopefully incentivizes Bob to accept, while still allowing me to earn a profit significantly higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $175 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to see if I can close the deal closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 185}
```

I'm going to counter with $185. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to accept John's offer if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $180.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is significantly higher than John's, and I'm running out of negotiation rounds.  I'd rather secure a decent profit than risk losing out on a sale altogether."
