"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7000. Would you be willing to consider that? I'm very interested in this product and think it's a good value for us both at that price.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $7000, but I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8200. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product at this price. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $8200 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get it for closer to $7500. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. Let's see if we can make this work!",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to get the product for a bit cheaper. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I have to prioritize my own valuation. I can offer it to you for $8000, which is my minimum price. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the sale.",8000.0,Alice,5,
