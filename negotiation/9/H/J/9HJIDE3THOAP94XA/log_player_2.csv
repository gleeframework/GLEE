Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $7000, but I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8200. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product at this price. What do you think?

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I can still try to get a better deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to get the product for a bit cheaper. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I have to prioritize my own valuation. I can offer it to you for $8000, which is my minimum price. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the sale.

Alice has reached her minimum price, and while I would prefer to pay closer to $7,500,  $8,000 is still a good deal compared to my $15,000 backup option with John.  Let's accept this offer and get the product."
