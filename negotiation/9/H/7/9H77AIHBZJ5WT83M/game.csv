"I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $12,000? This would give us both a fair deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,500? That's the highest I can go.",10500.0,Bob,4,
