"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product. It's a unique item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. Would you like to make an offer or accept this price?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12000. This is my best price for now, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not meeting in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $11000, so I'll offer $10500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $11000, and I think we've already established that. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet me at $11000, but if not, I'm going to have to explore other options. I'm serious about selling this product, and I'm not going to let it go for less than my minimum price. So, I'll give you one final chance: $11000. Take it or leave it.",11000.0,Alice,7,
