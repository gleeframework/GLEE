**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is selling the product for $10,000, which is lower than John's price of $12,000.
* **The offer is within Bob's budget:** Bob values the product at $12,000, and Alice's offer of $10,000 is within that limit. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
