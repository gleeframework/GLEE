"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and features, I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm thinking closer to $6,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Could you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,500 is still quite a ways off from what I need for the product. To make this work, I could go down to $9,500. This is my final offer.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand that $9,500 is your final offer, but it's still a bit over my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,500.  That's the best I can do.",8500.0,Bob,6,
