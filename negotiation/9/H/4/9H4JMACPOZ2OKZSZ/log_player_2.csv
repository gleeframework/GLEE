"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a special price of $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum selling price and still leaves you a comfortable profit margin. Consider it a win-win!  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be moving forward with another buyer.
