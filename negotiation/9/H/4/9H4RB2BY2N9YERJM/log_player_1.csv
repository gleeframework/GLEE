"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's high, but not unreasonable:** $1,500,000 is a significant markup from your minimum, but it allows for some negotiation room. 
* **It shows confidence:**  Offering a high price demonstrates that you believe in the product's value.
* **It opens the conversation:**  The message provides an opportunity for Bob to express his interest and potential concerns. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's reaction!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, I am not able to pay $1500000 for it. Could we perhaps meet somewhere closer to my budget of $1200000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good amount, it's still far from my minimum value of $1,000,000. I have 10 rounds to close the deal and I'm not in a rush. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a higher price.  I'll use this round to gauge his seriousness and willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,200,000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm willing to drop the price to $1,350,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I'm glad you've lowered your price. Considering the product's value and my budget, I propose we settle on $1300000. This seems like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up from $1,200,000 to $1,300,000, and we're now only $50,000 apart.  This is getting closer to my minimum, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  It's a fair compromise and allows me to secure a good price within a reasonable timeframe.  I'm confident I can use this $1,300,000 to my advantage."
