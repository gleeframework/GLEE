{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  Since you can get the product from John for $800,000, you have room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

You are still in a better position to negotiate with Alice. The product is worth $1,200,000 to her, and she is already offering a price lower than that. Rejecting the offer gives you more leverage to try to get a lower price."

With only one round left, you're unlikely to get a significantly lower price from Alice.  It's better to secure the product from John at your maximum price and avoid the risk of not getting a deal at all."
