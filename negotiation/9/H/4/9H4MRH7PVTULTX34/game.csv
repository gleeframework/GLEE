"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. How about $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I'm confident it will generate significant returns for you. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $1,000,000? This price is fair and allows both of us to benefit from this incredible deal. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,
