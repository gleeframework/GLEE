"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $15,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $13,750 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $14,625. This is a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise.",14625.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I'm getting close to my limit, but I could stretch to $14,000.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $14,375.  This is a fair price that's closer to what I need.  What do you say?",14375.0,Alice,7,
