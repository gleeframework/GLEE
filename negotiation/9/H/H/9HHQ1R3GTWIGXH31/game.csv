"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,500? I'm serious about buying the product if we can find a price that works for both of us.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate, but $6,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm trying to stay within a tight budget, and $8,250 is a little bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That would work really well for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
