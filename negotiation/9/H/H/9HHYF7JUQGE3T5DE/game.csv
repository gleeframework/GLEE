"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8500 right now. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9250? This would be a great price for both of us. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9250 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8750?  That's the highest I can go right now.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm happy to work with you.  I can go down to $9000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,5,
