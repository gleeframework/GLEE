"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I think the product is great, I'm only comfortable spending $120 at this time.  Would you be willing to work with me on that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to work with you. I'm thinking of a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $135 is still a little higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $125? That's a fair middle ground for us, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $130? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Plus, I'm getting a bit worried that John might swoop in and buy it from me at $120...",130.0,Alice,5,
