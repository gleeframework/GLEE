Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:** I need at least $800,000 for the product.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation space:** This leaves a $700,000 gap for negotiation.
* **Compromise:** Offering $1,200,000 splits the difference, giving me a good profit while still being appealing to Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still having a good chance of Bob accepting the offer."
