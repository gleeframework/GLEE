"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $14,000 is more than his limit, and he can likely get a better price through negotiation or by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject the offer.  While closer to his budget, $12,500 is still above his $10,000 limit.  He can likely get a better price through further negotiation or by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $11,000.  It's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're being firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13000. I'm willing to make a significant concession, but I still need to make a profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $13,000 is still too high for him, especially since John is selling the product for $10,000.  While he can make a counteroffer, it's getting risky to keep negotiating, as there are only a few rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is my final offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $11500, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $12250. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. The negotiations with Alice have gone on for several rounds and the price hasn't dropped to a level where it's worth it for Bob.  With only a few rounds remaining, there's a high chance Alice will not agree to his price and he'll be left with nothing.  Buying from John is the safest option to ensure he gets the product at a price within his budget."
