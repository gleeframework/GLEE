"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12000 is simply too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $17000? This still gives you a great price, and it's closer to my value for the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with $15000. It's still within my budget and close to your original asking price, while also being fair to me as a buyer. I hope this meets your expectations.",15000.0,Bob,4,
