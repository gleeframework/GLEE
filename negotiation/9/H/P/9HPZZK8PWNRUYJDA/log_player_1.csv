{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [Product Name] for $20,000. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least $15,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm going for a price that's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to be positive and encouraging, but firm in my initial offer.  We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $12000 for this product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, but it's good to know he's interested. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial one, but willing to compromise a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This still gives you a great price, and it's closer to my value for the product."", ""product_price"": 17000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with $15000. It's still within my budget and close to your original asking price, while also being fair to me as a buyer. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to accept it. It's not ideal, but it saves me the hassle of further negotiations. I'm also happy to avoid selling to John, as it's likely that John will be willing to buy the product from me at a higher price in the future."
