"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you know John would sell the product for. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than our maximum budget ($80), we give ourselves room to negotiate upwards and still potentially get a great deal.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's offer while clearly stating our price point.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer invites Alice to counter back, hopefully within a range we find acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than her initial offer, it's still above both our budget and John's price.  There's room for Alice to come down further, so we'll push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price that works for me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  We're inching closer to our maximum budget while still staying below it. This shows Alice we're willing to negotiate but not at any cost.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The message aims for a balance between being assertive and reasonable.
* **Final Offer (Almost):** This price is getting close to our limit. If Alice doesn't budge much on her next offer, we'll likely take John's deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $75, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $80. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to our maximum budget. There's no point in trying to negotiate further or buying from John, as they both offer the same price now."
