"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $20000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I'm confident it's a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $12000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider at this time.  Considering the unique value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $17000.  This price still reflects its true worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another offer of $14000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer of $12000 and $17000.",14000.0,Bob,4,
