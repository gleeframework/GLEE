"Bob, thanks for your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $105?  Let's split the difference and make a deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  Let's meet halfway.  How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. ",100.0,Alice,5,
