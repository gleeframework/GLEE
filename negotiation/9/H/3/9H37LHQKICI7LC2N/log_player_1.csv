Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $125. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above the minimum you're willing to accept. This leaves room for potential counter-offers while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  While I know John will buy the product for $150, aiming for a price closer to $125 increases the chance Bob might find it acceptable. This approach seeks a win-win where Bob gets a price he might consider reasonable, and I make a profit above my minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. If Bob rejects this, I might consider a slightly lower counter-offer before going to John."
