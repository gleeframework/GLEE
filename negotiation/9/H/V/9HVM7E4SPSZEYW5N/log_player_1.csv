Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000,  it's always best to aim higher initially. Bob values the product at $800,000, so there's a potential profit margin to explore.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can always fall back on my guaranteed sale to John at $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out."
