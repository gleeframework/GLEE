Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $10,000 guaranteed, there's a chance to get even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that's still very appealing to me (a significant profit) but also tempting to Bob as it's a good deal below his perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to haggle a bit, potentially leading to an even better deal for me."
