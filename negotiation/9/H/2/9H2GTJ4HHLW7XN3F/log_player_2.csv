"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob's maximum budget is $15,000.  
* **Alice's Offer:** $12,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.
* **Strategy:** It's always worth trying to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  A significant counteroffer (like $10,000) signals Bob's seriousness about negotiating and sets the stage for a back-and-forth. 
* **Leaving Room:**  There's still room for Alice to come up in price, so this isn't a ""take it or leave it"" offer.
* **Alice's Perspective:**  Alice now has to decide if she's willing to drop below her initial offer or risk losing the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.
* **Strategy:** Bob should continue to negotiate, as he's already shown he's willing to walk away.  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price. 
* **Potential Outcome:**  By rejecting, Bob might force Alice to come down even further or risk losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  This counteroffer moves Bob closer to Alice's last offer but keeps some space for further negotiation.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  It demonstrates that Bob is willing to compromise, but not at the expense of a good deal.
* **Pressure on Alice:**  Alice now has to decide if she's willing to accept a lower price or risk Bob walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Close:** Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's last counteroffer.
* **Saving Money:** Buying from Alice at $11,200 saves Bob a significant amount compared to buying from John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might walk away or make a counteroffer that's not as favorable.  Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids further potential delays."
