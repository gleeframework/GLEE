"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $110 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $90.  Would that work for you?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $100. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
