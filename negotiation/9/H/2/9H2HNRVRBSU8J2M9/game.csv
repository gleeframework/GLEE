"Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1000000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it provides to your business will more than justify the price.  Let's talk!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm happy to pay $900000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your enthusiasm for the product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950000.  This price still provides significant value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, I'm still a bit over budget. I'm willing to offer $925000. This is a fair price that's within my range and will allow us to close the deal. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $925000 is still a bit lower than what I can realistically accept. How about we meet in the middle at $937500? This allows us both to compromise and close the deal without either of us feeling like we lost too much.",937500.0,Alice,5,
