Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's trying to stay well below the product's worth to him ($1,000,000). We have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed profit now rather than risk Bob not significantly increasing his offer in the remaining rounds."
