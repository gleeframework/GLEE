"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you won't find anywhere else. I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a substantial discount from what I believe it's truly worth. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is offering the product at your maximum price point of $15,000, accepting the offer means you get the product at the best possible price for you.  There's no advantage to rejecting and then buying from John, as it would cost the same."
