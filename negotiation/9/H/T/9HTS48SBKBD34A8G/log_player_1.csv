Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a truly unique item, and I believe this price reflects its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price that is 20% higher than the product's value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves some potential for a profitable deal.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the uniqueness of the product, implying that its worth could be even higher than the asking price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message ends with an open invitation for Bob to respond, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer. 
* If his offer is too low, I can make a counter-counteroffer, gradually lowering my price until a compromise is reached or I decide to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still within the negotiation zone:** While lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price.  
* **Risk assessment:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I want to maximize my profit.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price somewhere between his offer of $1,100,000 and my initial offer of $1,200,000. 
* My goal is to find a price that balances my desire for profit with the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still reflects the unique value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm still emphasizing the product's uniqueness to justify the price. 
* **Closing the deal:** I'm using language that conveys urgency and encourages Bob to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to reassess the situation. If his counteroffer is still too low, I might consider accepting John's offer to ensure a guaranteed sale. 
* However, I'll continue to prioritize maximizing my profit and will only accept a price that is significantly higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm still not able to meet you at $1,150,000. I would like to propose $1,130,000 as a counteroffer. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,130,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Target:** Bob's offer of $1,130,000 is only $20,000 lower than my previous counteroffer of $1,150,000. This is a small difference, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer altogether, especially since he's already shown a willingness to walk away from the deal. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit of $130,000, which is a considerable amount.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll finalize the deal with Bob and ensure a smooth transaction. 
* Although I could potentially get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal and settling for John's offer outweighs the potential gain."
