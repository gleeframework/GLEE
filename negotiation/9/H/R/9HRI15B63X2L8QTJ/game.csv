"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm!  While I'm interested,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and I pay $850,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I can do $875,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm confident the product is worth it to you, and I'm willing to make a compromise.",875000.0,Alice,5,
