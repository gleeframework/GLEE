"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $120. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he doesn't, I'll be prepared to counter and eventually make my way down to John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still have room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price than $85, especially since I have 8 more rounds to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 
 
I'm aiming for a price closer to the middle ground,  keeping in mind that my minimum is $80 and Bob's offer was $85. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation but still ensures a profitable sale for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about $90, and we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum and closer to my ideal price. With 6 rounds remaining, it's a good time to secure a sale."
