"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,300 just isn't enough for me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a very fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's settle this and move forward.",9500.0,Alice,7,
