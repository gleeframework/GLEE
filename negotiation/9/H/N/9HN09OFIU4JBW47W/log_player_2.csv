"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm offering for sale.  I believe its value is quite high, so I'm starting with an initial price of $10000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice.  I'm willing to risk a few rounds to try and save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to get Alice to budge. I've dropped the price by $2,000, which is a substantial amount. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also looking for a good deal."
