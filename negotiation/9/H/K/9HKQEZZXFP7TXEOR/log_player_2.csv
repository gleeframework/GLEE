{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is far too expensive at $20,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if we can get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's try a price in the middle ground.  $15,000 is still a good deal for me, and hopefully, Alice will be more willing to negotiate at this point."

We're getting closer, but I'm still not willing to go above my budget. Let's see if we can get a better offer from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $16,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I believe I can still get a lower price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$15,500 is still above my budget.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if Alice is willing to come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  There's only one round left, so I'll need to be careful with my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm hoping that Alice will see the value of making a deal at this price, as it's still a good profit for her and allows me to stay within my budget. If Alice doesn't accept, I'll have to purchase the product from John for $10,000."
