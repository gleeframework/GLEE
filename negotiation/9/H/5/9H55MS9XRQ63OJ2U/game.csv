"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to find a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to stretch to $750,000 if that works for you. It's a strong offer.",750000.0,Bob,6,
