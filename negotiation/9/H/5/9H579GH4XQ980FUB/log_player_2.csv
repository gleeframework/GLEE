"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000, there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about $1,200,000?  That's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget. There's no point in further negotiation as he could buy the product from John for the same price."
