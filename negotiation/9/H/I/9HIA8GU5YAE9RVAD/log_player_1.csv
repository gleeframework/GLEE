Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Our goal is to get as close to that figure as possible while ensuring Bob still sees value in the deal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Strong Alternative:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John. This gives us a strong position and allows us to be firm on our price.

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, we maximize our chances of securing a price significantly higher than our guaranteed sale price to John."
