"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe it's a bit overpriced, and I'd like to see some more flexibility on your part. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still not convinced that $10,500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market rate. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
