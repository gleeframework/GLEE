"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $7,500 for the product. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $7,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $7,250. This is as low as I can go and still make it worth my while.",7250.0,Alice,5,
