{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point that is a good middle ground, leaving room for negotiation if needed. It is above my minimum price but below what the product is worth to Bob. It also leaves room for Bob to make a counter-offer if he feels the price is too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering its value.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $12,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price of $10,000 and closer to my desired price than what he initially offered. Accepting this offer is the best option for me in this round."
