"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering its value.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest possible price.  $12,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer, but there's still room to negotiate down further.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $12,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
