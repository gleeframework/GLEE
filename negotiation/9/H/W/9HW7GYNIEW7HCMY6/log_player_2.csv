"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a one-time price of $900,000. This is a unique chance to acquire a product that is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000, you know you have another option with John. Since John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, there's a chance you could negotiate a lower price with Alice by rejecting her initial offer."
