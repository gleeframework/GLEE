I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I want to see if I can get a higher price.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to start high and see what Bob's response is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a good compromise that could potentially lead to a deal. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in my product and that we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm comfortable accepting. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise and a strong indication that I'm serious about making a deal. It's also close enough to my minimum value that I feel comfortable with this offer. I hope that Bob will finally accept and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a reasonable price, it's still below my minimum value. I'm tired of negotiating with Bob, and it's clear we are too far apart in our valuations. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, which guarantees me a good return and saves me further hassle."
