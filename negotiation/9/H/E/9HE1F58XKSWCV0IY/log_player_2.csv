"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above my target of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice.  I'm also keeping in mind the option to buy from John if I don't reach a satisfactory price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is closer to my target, but it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, and I believe there's a chance she might come down further to meet me halfway.  I'm still keeping the option to buy from John in mind, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to offer $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,050,000 is still a bit above my ideal price, but it's a good compromise. I've been able to negotiate a significant discount from her initial offer, and I'm running out of rounds. Accepting this offer gives me a good deal without risking losing the product and having to buy from John at a higher price."
