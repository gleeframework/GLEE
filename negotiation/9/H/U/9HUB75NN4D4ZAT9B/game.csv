"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and the current market.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for you given the product's worth. Let's meet halfway.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and a reasonable compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
