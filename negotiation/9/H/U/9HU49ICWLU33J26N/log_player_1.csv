"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250

While $10,250 is tempting, I'm still determined to get closer to my minimum desired price. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $10,500.  How about we settle at $10,400? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 10400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $10,200?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200

While $10,200 is close to my minimum desired price, I'm still hesitant to settle. I have five rounds left and I want to try to get closer to $10,500.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to come down to $10,300. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10300}
```"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to make a bit more of a dent. How about $10,150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've reached the point where the negotiations are getting tedious and I'm not confident I can get a significantly better price from Bob. It's time to take the guaranteed $15,000 offer from John."
