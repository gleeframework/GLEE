I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This leaves some room for negotiation while ensuring I get a price closer to my desired value of $10,000.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but if he accepts, I'll have a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum target of $8,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $9,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's less than what the product is worth to him. It's also closer to my desired value and gives us a good middle ground to potentially close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still better than selling to John and it seems unlikely Bob will go higher. I'm willing to close the deal at this point."
