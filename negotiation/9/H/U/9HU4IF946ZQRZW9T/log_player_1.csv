"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a valuable asset to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000).  This allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him more willing to negotiate. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm ending with an invitation for Bob to share his thoughts, showing I'm open to a conversation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer or rejection.  I'll also keep in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I need to keep my spending within a certain budget. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I'm aiming for.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** Selling to John now would secure a decent profit, but I might be able to get a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000. I'll use the remaining rounds to try and find a middle ground that satisfies both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and still allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm countering Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but also my desire to secure a higher price.
* **Compromise:**  The new offer of $1,100,000 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the fairness of my offer.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm ending with an invitation to continue the conversation, showing flexibility and a desire for a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and decide whether to accept his counteroffer, make another counteroffer, or sell to John if the negotiations seem to be stagnating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Time is Money:** With only 6 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob increases.  It's becoming more likely that I'll have to sell to John, which would give me a lower profit.
* **Slight Compromise:** Accepting Bob's offer represents a small compromise, but it guarantees a sale and a decent profit.

**Next Steps:**

Although I would prefer to earn more, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale.  I'll need to weigh the potential for a higher price against the risk of losing the deal altogether."
