"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This reflects a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating, but $7,250 is still too low. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $7,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",7750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $7,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",7500.0,Bob,6,
