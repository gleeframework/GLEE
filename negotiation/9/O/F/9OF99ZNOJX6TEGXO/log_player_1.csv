Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly implies that $15,000 might even be a good deal. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While Alice has John as a backup, she doesn't mention him. Revealing this information weakens her negotiating position. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?"") inviting Bob to counter-offer and continue the negotiation."
