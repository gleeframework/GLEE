"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that respects the value of the product while also fitting my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
