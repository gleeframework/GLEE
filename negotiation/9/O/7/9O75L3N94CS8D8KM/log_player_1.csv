"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. It's incredibly valuable and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to establish a strong bargaining position.  The product is worth significantly more to Bob ($1,200,000) than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This offer gives us room to negotiate downwards while still securing a price well above my minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** I want to convey the product's value and my belief that it's a good investment for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, I am hoping we can find a price closer to my valuation. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. Bob's counteroffer was a significant jump down, indicating he's willing to move on price. I'll counter with a figure closer to my initial offer to test his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, the product's value justifies a higher price. I can come down to $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but staying firm above the $1 million mark. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a strong profit. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to support the higher price and make it clear I'm not willing to drop significantly. 
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" helps maintain a positive tone and encourages Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,000,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob is clearly willing to pay a premium for the product, and this price represents a fair compromise for both of us.
* **Time Factor:** While I have more rounds, there's no guarantee Bob will move much higher.  It's better to secure a strong deal now than risk him lowering his offer or walking away in later rounds."
