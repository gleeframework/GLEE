Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer was $100, and you are willing to pay up to $120.
* A counteroffer of $90 is a reasonable starting point, as it splits the difference and leaves room for negotiation.
* This counteroffer shows you are serious about buying the product, but are also willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $95.
* You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* Accepting this offer means saving $25 compared to buying from John.
* While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and you ending up buying from John for a higher price is significant."
