"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1100000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. Considering the product's value to you is $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1025000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you'll derive from the product, as well as my minimum acceptable price.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
