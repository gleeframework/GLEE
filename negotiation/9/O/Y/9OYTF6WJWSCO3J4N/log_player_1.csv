Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing you have John as a backup.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price ($150) allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing on a price higher than $150.
* **Appear Reasonable (but not too low):**  Starting at $140 seems reasonable without drastically undervaluing the product. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob only values the product at $80.  There's a chance he won't accept any offer above that, but the goal is to maximize your potential gain. 
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You can then decide if you want to negotiate further or stick with your original price knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer."
