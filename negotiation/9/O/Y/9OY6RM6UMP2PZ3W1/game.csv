"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $110.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $200 is my initial asking price, but I could come down to $170 for you. I think that's a fair deal considering the value this product offers.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $170 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you be willing to consider $130? That's a reasonable compromise, I believe.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I'm trying to be fair with my pricing. How about we split the difference and settle at $150?  That's my final offer.",150.0,Alice,5,
