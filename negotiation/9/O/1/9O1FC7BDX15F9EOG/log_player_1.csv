"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation. This price reflects the value of the product to me, and hopefully, Bob will see the potential value in it as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $1,600,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering Bob's initial counteroffer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is mutually agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, but I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation.  I don't want to risk further rounds and potentially end up with a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, so it's the safest option."
