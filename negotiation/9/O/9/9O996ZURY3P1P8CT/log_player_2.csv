Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and honesty. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product and what I'm willing to accept.

I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000, but that's contingent on you moving significantly from your current position. Do you see a path forward?
