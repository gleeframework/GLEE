Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so there's space for a counteroffer and potentially reaching a price closer to his valuation.
* **It shows confidence:** Starting high demonstrates that you believe in the value of your product.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $8,000, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. You can reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  I'm confident you'll find this a great deal considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-proposal:**  This counteroffer is a midpoint between your last offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($8,500). It shows you are willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:**  The message reminds Bob of the product's worth to him, making the price seem more reasonable.
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a positive and friendly tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise.  While it's not your ideal price, it's still significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000.  Furthermore, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.  It's a safe bet to accept his offer and secure a profit."
