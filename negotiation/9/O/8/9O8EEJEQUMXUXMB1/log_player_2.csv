"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for cheaper than $10,000.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob is trying to get the best price possible. He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice.
* **Strategic Offer:** By offering $8,500, Bob is showing Alice that he's serious about buying but also leaving room for some negotiation. This is a good starting point for a counteroffer.
* **Room for Compromise:** There's a clear gap between Bob's offer and Alice's original price.  This allows for both parties to potentially compromise and reach an agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9250?  I'm confident you'll find this a great deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is less than Alice's initial offer, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  He wants to keep the price as close to his target of $8,000 as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob is moving closer to Alice's offer but not giving in entirely.  This shows Alice he is serious about buying while still trying to get a better price.
* **Fair Compromise:**  $9000 is a reasonable midpoint between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous offer. It feels like a fair compromise, making it more likely for Alice to accept.
* **Urgency:** By mentioning ""finalizing this deal"", Bob is subtly implying a sense of urgency. This may nudge Alice to accept the offer rather than risk further negotiation."
