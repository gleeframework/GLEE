Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my initial investment. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice seems stuck on a price point that's not beneficial to me. It's clear she's unlikely to go below $1,000,000, especially with her claiming $1,075,000 is her lowest. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
