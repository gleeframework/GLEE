Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $900,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,000,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I've kept the message positive and friendly, highlighting the value proposition for Bob. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Starting Point:** $900,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount but doesn't immediately give away too much. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This allows for several rounds of counteroffers before I need to consider selling to John.
* **Potential for a Win-Win:** Bob is getting a good deal, and I'm still making a profit. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and decide whether to accept a counteroffer, make a new offer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your proposal. While I understand your position, I am unable to agree to a price higher than $850,000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate. Bob is firm at $850,000, and I'm not willing to go that low.
* **John's Offer:** John is offering my minimum value of $1,000,000, making him the better option. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Selling to John ensures I get the highest possible price for my product.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to result in a higher offer, and it's consuming time and energy. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will contact John and finalize the sale."
