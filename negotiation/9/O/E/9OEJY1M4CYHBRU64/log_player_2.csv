"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on its value of $12,000 to you. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it provides, I am extending this exclusive offer to you at a price of $10,000. This is an opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that is significantly below its market value. I look forward to hearing your decision soon. Kind regards, Alice. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While her offer is lower than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than what John is willing to sell it for. By rejecting her offer, you can negotiate a better price or simply buy from John and save $2,000."
