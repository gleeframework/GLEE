Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:** Offering the product at $135 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It's also a price that could be perceived as a ""deal"" compared to an unknown higher original price. 
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. This means Alice doesn't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob.
* **Prioritizing Profit:** While $150 is attainable from John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could yield a better return."
