Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, increasing your profit. 
* **Ensure a Sale:**  Offering a price significantly lower than $120 ensures Bob is likely to accept, as it provides him with a good deal. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and forcing you to sell to John for $80."
