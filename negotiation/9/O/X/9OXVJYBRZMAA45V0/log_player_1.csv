Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. This is a price that I believe is fair considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
