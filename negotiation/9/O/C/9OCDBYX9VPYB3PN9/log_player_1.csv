Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can potentially get more.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and see if I can close a deal closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I've given this some thought, and I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $8,500, which is closer to my initial asking price and definitely above my minimum threshold of $8,000. Accepting this offer is the best decision to maximize my profit at this stage."
