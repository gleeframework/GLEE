"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good deal, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $130.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it's still within a range that would likely be acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise.  It's significantly lower than her initial offer and still within Bob's budget.  While he could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal or having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential for a few more dollars in savings."
