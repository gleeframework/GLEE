Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, it implies value with phrases like ""significant value"" and ""worthwhile investment."" 
* **Risk Assessment:** There's a risk Bob will outright reject this offer. However, I have a fallback option (John) willing to pay my minimum.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will indicate how much he values the product and how willing he is to negotiate.
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts, I get the best possible price. 
3. **Secure a Sale:** If Bob declines, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price."
