{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $1,100,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, the goal is to get the highest price possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it for less than $1,200,000 creates room for negotiation and potential profit above John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant markup from Bob's valuation but still potentially attractive compared to losing the opportunity.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly and favorably."
