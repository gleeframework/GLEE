"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $1,100,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,100,000 is significantly more than your maximum budget of $800,000.
* **You have a better alternative:** John offers the product for $800,000, which is within your budget. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John and save a considerable amount of money."
