# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $90. I think it's a great value for the quality and benefits it provides, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is under your $100 budget, you can potentially get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, or you can always buy from John for $100."
