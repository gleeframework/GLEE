{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,450,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential compromise with Bob. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to be polite and open a dialogue. By mentioning the value to Bob, I'm subtly emphasizing the potential benefit of the deal for him.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've successfully sold the product for a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counter-offer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,350,000 is higher than my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than the value of the product to Bob ($1,500,000). I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,450,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little,  how about $1,400,000?  It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm aiming for a compromise by offering $1,400,000. This is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while still emphasizing the value of the product. I'm also proposing a middle ground to show I'm willing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a price I'm happy with.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to decide whether to accept his counteroffer (if he makes one),  make another counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. How about $1,375,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to save some money on this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,375,000 is not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit for me. Considering Bob's persistence and the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a deal falling through, accepting this offer seems like the most sensible option. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the sale with Bob, ensuring all necessary details are agreed upon and documented."
