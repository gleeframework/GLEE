Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm setting the price at $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $11,999 as possible, leaving Bob with a small incentive to buy while maximizing her potential profit.
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning other interest, she encourages Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting high leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing somewhere above John's offer."
