Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $11,000.  This is a fair price, given that I'm willing to close the deal now. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000.
