Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:**  $1,200,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value proposition for Bob. It avoids being aggressive or demanding. 
* **Next steps:** By stating ""Let me know your thoughts,"" I open the door for Bob to either accept, counteroffer, or ask for more information. This keeps the negotiation flowing.

**Important Note:** Remember, I have the option to walk away at any point and sell to John for $1,500,000. This gives me leverage throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  I have the option to negotiate further, and there's a chance Bob might increase his offer. 
* **Leverage with John:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for a much higher price gives me the leverage to push for a better deal from Bob. 

**Next Step:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still lower than what John is willing to pay. This will allow me to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still represents a good value for you, and it allows me to move forward with the transaction.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a substantial drop from my initial offer but still well above Bob's offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value the product offers to Bob, emphasizing that $1,100,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Openness:** I end with ""What do you think?"" to encourage further dialogue and keep the negotiation moving.

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise. If he's serious about buying the product, he'll likely come up from $900,000.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price,  and I have the option to sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my terms.
* **Staying Flexible:** I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not going to let Bob push me too far below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,500,000 I can get from John. 
* **Negotiation leverage:** I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, especially considering the fact that Bob has already increased his offer twice. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to Bob for $1,050,000 is a guaranteed deal, it's not the most profitable option.  The potential of getting a higher price from Bob outweighs the risk of further negotiation.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob once again. I will try to find a compromise that is closer to my minimum acceptable price without driving Bob away completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make a final concession.  I'll accept $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to move forward.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm dropping my price to $1,150,000, which is still higher than Bob's last offer but closer to his budget. This signals that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **Finality:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I create pressure on Bob to make a decision. This encourages him to consider the potential loss if he rejects the offer.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize that the price is fair by reiterating the value of the product.

**Strategy:**

* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer closes the gap between our desired prices. It's a significant compromise on my part, but it's a reasonable offer given Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not in a rush to settle for a low price. 
* **High Stakes:** By stating this is my final offer, I increase the stakes for Bob. He'll have to weigh the potential of getting a better deal in the future against the risk of losing the product altogether."
