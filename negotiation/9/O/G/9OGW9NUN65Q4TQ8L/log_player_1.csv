"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a strong initial benchmark and leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, so I'm aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$1,000,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and secure a deal that's profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject this offer and keep negotiating. There's still room to find a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,600,000. This shows good faith in the negotiation while still keeping the price above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to pay a price that I find acceptable.  I've made concessions, but he's not showing a willingness to compromise further. Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might lead to a lower price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of a deal falling through with Bob."
