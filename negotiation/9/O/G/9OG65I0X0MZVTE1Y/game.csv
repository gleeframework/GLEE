"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?  I believe this is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $9,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still outside of my price range.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I believe this is a fair price, given the value of the product and my budget constraints.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer you a price of $10,750. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,250?  This would be a fair price, given the value of the product and the significant concessions I've already made.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $10,600. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",10600.0,Alice,7,
