Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but below the guaranteed price from John. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and also signals that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is more than Bob initially valued the product at, it's still significantly less than what I need to make. I'm rejecting his offer and will make a counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering at $125. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above what Bob offered. I'm hoping this compromise will entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I need to make. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm dropping the price slightly to $110. It's still above Bob's last offer, but this is my final offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm serious about selling to him and agree to this price. If he doesn't, I'm ready to sell to John and get the guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $150.  Bob is clearly not willing to meet my price, and I'm not willing to go lower than $110. Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially get less than what I need, I'm taking the guaranteed $150 from John."
