"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, as I'm looking to stay within a tight budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is my best counteroffer so far. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is a fair price for this product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. This is my best offer so far. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I can realistically afford.  I'm offering $975,000 for the product, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budgetary constraints.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into our negotiation, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still unable to go above $975,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budgetary constraints.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,8,
