"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product for a special price of $110. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $110.** This is less than your maximum budget of $120.
* **Buying from John would cost you $120.** This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save $10."
