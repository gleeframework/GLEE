"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to encourage him to consider my offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to negotiation.

**Next steps:** 

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects my offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and potentially lower my price slightly. However, I'll always keep in mind that I can sell the product to John for $100, so I'm not willing to go below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob has shown interest in the product. 
* **Safeguard with John:** I'm confident I can get a better price, but having the option to sell to John for $100 provides a safety net.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer slightly lower than my original price but still above my minimum.  
* **Iterative negotiation:** I'll use this round to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and refine my strategy accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price slightly from $120 to $110, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Profit:** $110 is still above my minimum of $100, ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Reiterate value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm using language that implies I'm open to further discussion.

**Next steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's next move. If he rejects, I'll need to decide if I'm willing to lower my price further or sell to John. 
* **Strategic bargaining:** I'll continue to use a combination of compromise and firmness to try and close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $90 is a bit low, but $110 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further room for negotiation:**  There is no benefit to rejecting his offer and trying to negotiate further. 
* **Time constraint:** We are nearing the middle of the negotiation, and it's better to close the deal now than risk losing the sale entirely.

**Next steps:**

* **Close the deal:** I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
