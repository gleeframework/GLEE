# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and can greatly benefit you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is way over his budget and he can get the same product from John for $10,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. He can still get a better deal from John."
