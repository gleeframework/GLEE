"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously crafted to meet your needs. Given its exceptional quality and functionality, it's valued at $150 by myself. Considering its worth to you might be around $80, I aim to strike a fair deal. Would you be interested in acquiring this product for $120? I believe this price reflects a balance between the value the product holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's offer is better than her initial valuation, $120 is still significantly higher than your $80 maximum and what John is offering. You can do better by rejecting and going with John."
