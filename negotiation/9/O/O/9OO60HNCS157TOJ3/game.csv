"Alice,  $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for us to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,950,000. This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,950,000 is still out of my range. Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget constraints. I'm confident this is a fair price that would benefit both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
