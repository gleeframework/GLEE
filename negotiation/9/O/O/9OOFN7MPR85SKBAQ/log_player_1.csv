{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where I am still making a good profit, but also leaving room for potential counteroffers from Bob.  It also highlights the value he would be getting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'd be willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth, and I'd like to try to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which still gives you a great deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,500 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is a good compromise. It's more than what John would pay and closer to my initial target. Accepting this offer allows for a quick and profitable sale."
