"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $11,000.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This takes into account your budget and still allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is getting closer, I'm still looking to stay within my budget.  I'm ready to offer $10,000, which is my final offer. If this works for you, let's finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
