"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get it for less. There are still 9 rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Bob starts with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming to create some pressure on Alice. 
* **Fair Starting Point:**  $9,500 is still a good deal for Alice (above her own valuation) and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Clear Intent:**  The message reiterates Bob's willingness to buy, but only at a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This takes into account your budget and still allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Yet:**  $10,500 is closer to Bob's target, but he can still potentially do better.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's still room to negotiate a lower price. Even a small decrease in price saves Bob money.
* **Strategy:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice could lead to a price closer to Bob's desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is getting closer, I'm still looking to stay within my budget.  I'm ready to offer $10,000, which is my final offer. If this works for you, let's finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer clearly states Bob's maximum price and sets the stage for a decisive response.
* **Pressure Point:** By stating ""other options,"" Bob implies he's ready to walk away if Alice doesn't accept.
* **Target Price:** This offer is Bob's desired price, which he's willing to pay to avoid buying from John."
