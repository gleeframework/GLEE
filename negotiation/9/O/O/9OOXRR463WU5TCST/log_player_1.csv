Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer. Let's see if we can push Bob a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to be fair. However,  $1,075,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,110,000, but I can't go any lower."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I still think $1,110,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

It's getting close to the wire, and Bob seems to be firmly planted at this price point. Accepting $1,080,000 is a solid profit and avoids the risk of him walking away altogether in later rounds."
