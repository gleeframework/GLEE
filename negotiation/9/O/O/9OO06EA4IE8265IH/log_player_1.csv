Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $120. I believe it's a fantastic deal and worth considering."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($120) allows room for negotiation.  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it gives me a sense of how much he might be willing to pay. There's a chance Bob might accept the high price, netting me a great profit. If not, I can always negotiate down towards his perceived value of $80, or take John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $60 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($80) and his perceived value ($80). Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. It's clear there's room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my target while still leaving some space for bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $60 is quite low considering the value of this product.  Could you meet me halfway at $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:** I've significantly reduced my asking price from $120 to $90, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  This price point is still a profitable one for me, being above my minimum of $80, while also being closer to Bob's initial offer.  By suggesting we ""meet halfway,"" I'm using a collaborative tone to encourage agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $70 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob increased his offer, but $70 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm willing to negotiate a bit further, but I need to make it clear that I won't go below my threshold.  I'll make one more counteroffer close to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here.  How about we settle this at $80? That's my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:** I've now met Bob at his true valuation of the product and my own minimum acceptable price. By stating it's my ""final offer,"" I'm signaling that I'm firm on this price and won't go lower. This leaves Bob with a clear choice: accept a fair price or risk losing the deal. If he rejects this, I'm content to walk away and sell to John for the same amount."
