"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $950000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it, considering its potential value. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about we meet at $850000? I believe this price still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me halfway.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is a fair price considering our previous discussions and the potential value I see in this product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to find common ground. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we meet at $825000? This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to make a stronger offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,
