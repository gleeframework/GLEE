"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1000000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe the product's value is worth a bit more than that, but I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $925000. Can you consider that?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to meet me halfway again, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $925000. How about we try $975000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $975000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you at $960000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is my final offer on that price point. What do you say?",960000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $960000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $930000, but no higher. Can you consider that?",930000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle after all. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $955000. I think that's a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into this negotiation. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",955000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $920000, but no higher. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $800000. Can you reconsider?",920000.0,Bob,10,
