"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $95.  How does that sound?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $95, which would be $100. It's a fair price for this amazing product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",100.0,Alice,5,
