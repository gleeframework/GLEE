"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $9500 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10500.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's the lowest I can go while still making sure I get a fair price for the product.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope you can consider it.",10000.0,Bob,4,
