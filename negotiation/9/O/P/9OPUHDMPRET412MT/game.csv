"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is too low.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
