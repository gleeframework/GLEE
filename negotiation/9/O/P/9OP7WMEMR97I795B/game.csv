"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I can make a profit.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice. $105 is closer, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Would you be willing to do it for $95? I'm hoping to find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 still isn't quite there for me. Would you consider $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
