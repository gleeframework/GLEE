"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1200000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price of $1,000,000. You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer. It's worth negotiating further before resorting to buying from John at a higher price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This price is fair considering your value of $1,000,000 and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1080000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a great deal on a product you really want. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,080,000, which is closer to your target price and still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. It's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a small reduction in price, making it worthwhile to accept this offer rather than risking a further counteroffer or buying from John at a higher price."
