"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You value the product at $100 and Alice is offering it for $90. While this is a good deal, you can get it for $100 from John.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John saves you $10."
