"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value. While I cannot disclose specific details, I can assure you that its worth to me is no less than $1500000. I believe this product has the potential to be extremely beneficial to you, and I'm confident you'll see its value. My asking price is $2000000. This offer is only valid for a limited time. Let me know if you're interested in exploring this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. While she claims the product is worth more to her, that information doesn't change the fact that the price is too high for you.  You have a guaranteed alternative with John at a much lower price."
