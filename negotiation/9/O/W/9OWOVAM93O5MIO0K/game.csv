"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $600000. Considering your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $750000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $700000.  This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I also need to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I still believe the product's value is closer to $800000. Considering your willingness to pay $700000, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $725000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and shows my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Alice,5,
