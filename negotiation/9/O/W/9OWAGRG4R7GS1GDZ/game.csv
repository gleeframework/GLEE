"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially even exceeding $1500000. I'm willing to let you acquire it for a price of $2000000. This is a price that reflects its potential, but also allows for room for negotiation. Consider the opportunity and let me know your thoughts. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1500000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
