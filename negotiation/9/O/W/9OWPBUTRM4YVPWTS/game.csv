"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,600,000?  This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's split the difference and go for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen!",1500000.0,Alice,5,
