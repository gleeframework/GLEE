"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to part with it for.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has stated this is her lowest price.  The difference between her offer ($825,000) and John's price ($1,000,000) is significant enough that it's worth securing the deal now."
