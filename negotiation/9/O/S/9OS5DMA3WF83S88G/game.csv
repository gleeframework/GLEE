"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $2,000,000 to you. To make this a swift deal, I'm offering it at $1,800,000. What do you say?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your valuation is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $1,400,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
