It's always better to try and negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives you a chance to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range for both parties.  It leaves room for negotiation, but also demonstrates that you're serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  There's a good chance you can get a lower price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 860000}
```

This counteroffer is a small step closer to Alice's price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It shows you're serious about buying the product, but are still trying to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's more advantageous to accept Alice's offer.  You've already negotiated the price down significantly, and further negotiation may be time-consuming with no guarantee of a better deal. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product for a price within your budget and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity to John."
