{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $15,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to me, making it sound like a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message invites Bob to respond and engage in further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is a strategic starting point. I'll observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his response. If he rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer. However, I always have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While I could accept his offer and earn some profit, I believe there's potential for a better price. 
* **Negotiation:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of securing a higher price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. However, I will closely monitor the negotiation and be ready to sell to John for $15,000 if it becomes clear that a better price is unlikely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, emphasizing that $13,500 is still a good deal for him.
* **Open to Finalization:**  My message invites Bob to accept the offer, potentially concluding the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this price, making it a win-win situation. If he rejects it, I'll assess his next move and consider my options, including selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,800 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $12,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Close to Minimum:** While $12,800 is only slightly below my minimum price, I've already made multiple concessions and there's a risk that further negotiation won't yield a better result.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, ensuring a profitable transaction.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to sell to John because:

* It minimizes the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to budge significantly.
* It provides a guaranteed profit that meets my minimum requirements.

While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to compromise my minimum price, and John's offer is a reliable alternative."
