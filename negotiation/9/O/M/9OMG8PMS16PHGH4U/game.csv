"I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd love to save some money if possible.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to spend $110. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $95. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to take the product at this price.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $105. I think the product is worth it, and I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $102. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me halfway.",102.0,Alice,7,
