"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to accept $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $950,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000 as a final offer.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.  If this isn't agreeable, I'll have to consider other options. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",975000.0,Bob,6,
