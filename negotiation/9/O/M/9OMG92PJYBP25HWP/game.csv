"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,250, which is a fair compromise. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
