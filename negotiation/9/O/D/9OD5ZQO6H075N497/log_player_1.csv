"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price. $700,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth, and I believe I can secure a better deal."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, recognizing the value this product brings to you.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $775,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $775,000 is closer to my target, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I believe I can get a higher price, so I'll try to negotiate further."
