"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high for Bob. Even though the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, Alice is trying to sell it for $1,200,000, which is 50% more than its value to Bob. Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but also a price he is comfortable paying. This shows good faith while leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is above your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still too high for Bob. He's comfortable paying $850,000, and Alice's $1,050,000 offer is still above that.  It's worth another counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's last offer, showing he's willing to compromise.  $900,000 is still within Bob's budget and hopefully closer to a price point that Alice might be willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value of the product to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but she's still asking for $950,000, which is $50,000 more than Bob is comfortable paying. While there's a possibility she might come down further, at this point it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John for $800,000.  This guarantees a lower price and avoids further negotiation that may not result in a successful outcome."
