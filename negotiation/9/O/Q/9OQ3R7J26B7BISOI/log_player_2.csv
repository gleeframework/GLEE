Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $12,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  It's time to go with the sure thing and buy from John for $10,000."
