# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm not sure if I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, especially since I've seen it for sale from another seller, John, for $1,500,000. I think I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better deal.
