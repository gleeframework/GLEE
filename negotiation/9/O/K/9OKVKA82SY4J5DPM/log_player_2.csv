"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is the lowest so far, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  There's a $300,000 difference between Alice's offer and what Bob is willing to pay, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a good deal.  He's offering $200,000 less than Alice's initial price, which is a substantial discount. This is a bold move, but it shows Bob is serious about getting a good price and is willing to negotiate. The hope is that Alice might be willing to compromise to avoid losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's closer than before. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He has a $150,000 buffer before he needs to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway.  He's raised his offer by $150,000, showing a willingness to compromise.  This offer is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer but higher than his initial counteroffer. The goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both parties and avoids the need to buy from John at a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $100,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer. This is a small difference, and it's getting closer to Bob's ideal price. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John is increasing.  It's better for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that is still within his budget and significantly lower than John's."
