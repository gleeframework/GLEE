"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire it at a price below your valuation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Alice's offer is below your maximum valuation, you can get a better price from John. Rejecting this offer might incentivize Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $8,000."
