"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $165. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to find a solution within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $155? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $155. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of $160. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts, Alice. I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we possibly reach an agreement at $157? I believe this would be a reasonable compromise for both of us.",157.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $160, Bob. I've already made a few concessions, and I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $157 and $160, which would be $158.50. This is my last offer, and I hope you can accept it.",158.5,Alice,7,
