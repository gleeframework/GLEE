"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is in the ballpark, I can't quite agree to that figure given the unique aspects of this product. Would you consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value it brings.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",950000.0,Bob,4,
