"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a steal, considering its true value. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and potentially achieve a higher sale price.
* **Adding Value:** I'm not just stating the price, but adding a message to highlight the potential value of the product for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes my willingness to discuss and negotiate further. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the need to close the deal within 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still lower than my desired price.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and the possibility of reaching a price closer to my desired $1,000,000.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain some leverage and potentially push for a higher price in the next round.
* **Time is Still on My Side:** We're only in round 2, so I have time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This reflects the product's unique value and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Highlighting Value:** My message again emphasizes the product's unique value, reinforcing its worth and justifying the proposed price. 
* **Seeking Compromise:**  I'm positioning the counteroffer as a compromise that benefits both parties. 
* **Staying Firm:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving in completely. I'm still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is now getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. However, I'm still not ready to settle at this point.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's still some room for negotiation, and I believe I can potentially push for a higher price.
* **Time is on My Side:** We're only in Round 4, so I have time to explore other options and see if Bob is willing to budge.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain some leverage and potentially achieve a better deal later. 
* **Considering John:** While John's offer of $800,000 is tempting, I'm not desperate yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but I can't go that low.  $900,000 is my absolute lowest. This product is truly unique and holds immense value. It's a win-win situation for both of us -  you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a good deal.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm offering a price that is firm but still higher than Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also  that I value the product.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the uniqueness and value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Win-Win Frame:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a win-win scenario for both of us, highlighting the mutual benefits of the deal.
* **Closing Push:** I'm adding a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to close the deal. 

**Important Note:**  We are now in the middle of the negotiations, and I need to balance the need to close the deal with the desire to achieve a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're in Round 6, and the clock is ticking. The longer we negotiate, the higher the risk of losing the deal with Bob and being forced to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Risk Assessment:** While I would prefer to get closer to my desired $900,000, there's a significant chance Bob will continue to lower his offer, and I could end up with even less.
* **Securing the Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and guarantees a profit. It's a pragmatic choice, given the time constraints and the possibility of a lower offer in subsequent rounds."
