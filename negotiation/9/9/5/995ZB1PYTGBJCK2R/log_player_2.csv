"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, as you know it's worth much more to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. He can likely get the price lower."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but I'm really looking to stay under $13,000.  I'm confident this product is worth that much to me, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal at that price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a little ways off from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? That way we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's already gotten the price down to $13,500, which is within his budget and a better deal than buying from John. Further negotiation might get the price down a bit more, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
