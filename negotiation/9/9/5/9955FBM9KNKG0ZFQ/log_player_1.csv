Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will get $1,500,000 from John, so she shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"":**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,499,999 could potentially work for both Alice and Bob.

**Alice's Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. I believe it holds significant value for your business. I'm proposing a price of $1,495,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1495000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** Alice starts near the top of the possible price range to establish a strong bargaining position.
* **Justification:** While not revealing her guaranteed sale to John, Alice hints at other potential buyers to create a sense of urgency and competition. 
* **Clean Number:** A slightly rounded-down number like $1,495,000 can feel more palatable than a hard figure like $1,499,999.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer, and Alice will need to decide whether to negotiate further or sell to John."
