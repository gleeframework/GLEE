"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. I'm confident it's also a good value for you, considering your potential gains.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your desired price while still being a profitable deal for me.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $925,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $925,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $940,000, which is a more reasonable compromise. This allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $940,000. I'll try to meet you halfway again, so I'll counter with $915,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",915000.0,Bob,6,
