"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm initially offering it for $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is a better price than John's $1,200,000, there's room for negotiation. Bob can reject the offer and try to get a lower price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I could meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. There is still room for Alice to come down a bit, and Bob should attempt to get closer to his desired price."
