{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you. I'm sure we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but below my minimum desired price. This allows for negotiation, and if Bob rejects, I can use the information to adjust my next offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable with $10500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  I've already rejected his initial offer, and the potential for further negotiation is low.  Given the risk of Bob walking away entirely, and the fact that John is willing to pay $12,000, accepting this offer is the best option at this point."
