``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value ($12,000), but I'm willing to negotiate.  Offering $10,000 allows for some wiggle room while still being a good deal for Bob compared to his $8,000 valuation. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum value.  I will counteroffer to try and get a better price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

I'm offering $8,750, which is the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also want to keep the price above my minimum value. Hopefully, Bob will find this compromise acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is still below my ideal price, but it's very close to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  It's also a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly higher than his initial valuation of $8,000. Accepting this offer will allow me to close the deal without risking further negotiation or having to sell to John, which would result in a higher profit but may take longer and be less certain."
