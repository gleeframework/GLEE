"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $675000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $600000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your increased offer. However, I'm still not willing to go below $650000. I believe the product's value is worth more than that.
