"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and would bring you a lot of value. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal price range. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his personal limit. Bob should try to negotiate further to see if he can get a lower price before having to resort to buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
