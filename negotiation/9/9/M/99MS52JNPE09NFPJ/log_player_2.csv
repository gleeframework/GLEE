"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You can get the product for less than $1,400,000 from John. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. 
* There's potential to get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This offer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* It's a reasonable starting point, considering Alice's value of the product is $1,200,000.
* This counteroffer allows for a potential win-win scenario, where Alice can still make a profit and Bob gets a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $150,000 lower than John's price. 
* This is a good deal for Bob, as it saves him a considerable amount of money.
* While further negotiation is possible, there's a risk that Alice might reject a lower counteroffer and the negotiation could break down.
* Accepting the current offer ensures a successful purchase at a price better than John's."
