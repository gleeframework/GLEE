"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm trying to pique Bob's interest by suggesting he'll appreciate the product.
* **Open-ended question:** This encourages Bob to respond and potentially make a counter-offer. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum price as possible while still securing a sale.  I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses and keep John's offer of $150 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think I can find something similar for less. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While I'm not happy with Bob's offer, it's a good starting point for further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving some room for compromise. My goal is to push Bob closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:**  I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at his expense.
* **Reasonable price:**  $160 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price.

**Strategy:**

This round aims to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to lower my price further or accept John's offer for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not desperate enough to accept an offer that's not profitable.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counter-offer. I'll aim for a price closer to $150, but still be willing to negotiate.  I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $145.  This would allow me to make a fair profit, and it's still a good deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm showing Bob that I'm open to finding a middle ground.
* **Fair profit:**  $145 is still above my minimum and allows me to make a reasonable profit.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the need to reach an agreement to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This offer is a strong compromise, closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum. This round is crucial for determining whether Bob is willing to close the deal or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate, and Bob is unwilling to go higher than $140.
* **John's offer:** John offers a better price of $150, which is closer to my minimum and more profitable.
* **Time constraint:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the chances of Bob increasing his offer significantly are low.

**Strategy:**

It's more advantageous to accept John's offer and secure a sale at a higher price.  It's risky to continue negotiating with Bob, as the time pressure is high, and there's no guarantee he'll budge."
