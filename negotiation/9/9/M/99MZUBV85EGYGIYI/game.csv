"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I value your business, $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  This would give us both a fair outcome.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're able to accept this offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
