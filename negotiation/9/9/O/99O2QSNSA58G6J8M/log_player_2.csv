"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a decent price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a lower counteroffer, potentially saving more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  However, I'm hoping to get a better deal.  Would you be willing to accept $13,000 for the product?  I'm serious about buying it, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $13,500 is less than Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **Better than John's price:**  $13,500 is significantly less than John's price of $15,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go lower. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure a good deal without risking a longer negotiation."
