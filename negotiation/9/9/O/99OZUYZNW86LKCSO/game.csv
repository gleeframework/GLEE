"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  However, $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is still a little out of my range, but I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's close this deal.  How about $10,500?  That's my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer.  While I'm eager to get this product, $10,500 is still just a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250. This represents a significant compromise and would allow us to close this deal now.  What do you think?",10250.0,Bob,6,
