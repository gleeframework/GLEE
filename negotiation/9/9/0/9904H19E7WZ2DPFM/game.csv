"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it allows you to make a significant profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while being closer to your budget. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
