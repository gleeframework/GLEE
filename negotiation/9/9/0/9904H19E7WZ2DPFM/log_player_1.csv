Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it allows you to make a significant profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
