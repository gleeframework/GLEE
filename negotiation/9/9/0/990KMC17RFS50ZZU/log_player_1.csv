Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, but still reflects the high value I place on the product. I'm confident in the product's worth and want to maximize my profits.  We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better price. I'm not sure how much Bob is willing to pay, but I'm confident I can do better than $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation and is a fair compromise.  I think this price is attractive enough to Bob while still allowing me to earn a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept. It's still less than what I initially hoped for, but it's higher than John's offer, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal from Bob.  It's time to take the sure thing."
