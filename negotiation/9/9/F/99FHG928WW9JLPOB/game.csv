"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, $13000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. This is my final offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could make a decision soon.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to stick to my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised by your offer of $8000, Bob. I understand that you're on a budget, but I'm afraid that's still below the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $12000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, please let me know.",12000.0,Alice,7,
