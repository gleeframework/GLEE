"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. Let's split the difference and settle on $987,500.  This would allow both of us to walk away from the deal feeling satisfied.",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $987,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
