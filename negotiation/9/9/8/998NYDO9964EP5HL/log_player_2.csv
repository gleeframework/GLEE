"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $12,000 to him and Alice is offering it for $9,500. This means Bob can potentially save $2,500 if he negotiates further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He knows Alice is willing to sell for at least $8,000, so he starts with a counteroffer of $8,500, which is still a good deal for him and leaves room for some negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,800 is higher than her previous offer of $9,500, and it's still above Bob's desired price. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has rejected Alice's previous offer, and he is willing to pay up to $12,000. He wants to close the deal, but at a price lower than the current offer of $9,800.  A counteroffer of $9,000 is a reasonable compromise, offering a significant saving for Bob while still being above Alice's minimum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,600 is lower than her previous offer of $9,800.  While it's still above Bob's desired price, it's a good deal for him considering he is willing to pay up to $12,000.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $2,400 compared to buying from John."
