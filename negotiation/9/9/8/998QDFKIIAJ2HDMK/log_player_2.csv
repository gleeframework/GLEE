# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, Bob. I think you'll really appreciate its value and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer is way above your budget and even higher than her initial value.  You have a better alternative with John.
