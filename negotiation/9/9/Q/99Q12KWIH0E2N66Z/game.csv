"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $75. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $82 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $80?  That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
