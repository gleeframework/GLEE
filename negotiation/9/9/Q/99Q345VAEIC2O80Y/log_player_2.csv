"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for a price that's significantly below its market value. I understand this product is worth $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $900000. This is a chance for you to acquire it at a great price, and for me to secure a sale well above my minimum requirement. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $900,000, while John is asking for $1,000,000.
* **You still save money:**  Even though the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, you can acquire it for $900,000, saving $100,000."
