"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, and it's still significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I have 8 more rounds, and there's potential for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000. This is still a significant amount, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider while still being closer to my desired value."
