"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $1500000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can we meet in the middle at $1600000?",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at $1700000? It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1600000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1600000. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1650000? It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
