"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still gives you a great deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would that work for you?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down further to $850,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair profit for me. I believe this is a good compromise. Let's close the deal!",850000.0,Alice,5,
