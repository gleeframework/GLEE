Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the waters:** A price of $2,250,000 (150% of your minimum) allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential for a higher profit margin.  
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity,"" ""immense value,"" and ""fair reflection"" to frame the high price as justified.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** You achieve a significant profit beyond your minimum.
* **Bob negotiates:** This opens the door for bargaining, and you can gradually lower the price, staying above your $1,500,000 safety net.
* **Bob rejects:**  You move on to John and secure your guaranteed $1,500,000."
