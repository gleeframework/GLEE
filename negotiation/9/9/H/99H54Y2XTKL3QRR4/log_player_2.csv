"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her value for the product. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation while signaling I'm looking for a significantly lower price. 
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed politely to maintain a good negotiating atmosphere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $100 is still too high. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate a better deal.  We'll counter with a price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  How about $90? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  We're roughly splitting the difference between her last offer ($100) and our previous counteroffer ($85). This shows willingness to move towards a deal.
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is straightforward, emphasizing fairness and keeping the negotiation moving. 
* **Staying Below Our Limit:**  Even if Alice accepts this offer, we're still well below our maximum budget of $120."
