"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, my budget allows me to pay up to $1,100,000 for this item. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this asset.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,175,000. This price acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable return. I believe this represents a fair compromise that benefits both of us. ",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While $1,175,000 is closer to what I'm willing to pay, I still believe we can find a better solution. I propose a price of $1,125,000 for the product. This reflects a compromise that respects both our interests.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $1,125,000 is still a bit below what I can accept. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,150,000. This offer represents a significant concession on my part and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
