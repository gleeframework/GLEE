{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation, as this might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.  However, I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $125 is a fair price, I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $135. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $135, which would be $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$130 is a good price. It's above my minimum and it's a fair compromise.  It's not worth risking losing the sale to John by trying to get a higher price."
