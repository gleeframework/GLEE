"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $175 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is significantly below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $120. This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it.  What do you say?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $95 is closer, it's still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. Let me know if you're interested.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $107.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $100 is an improvement, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,7,
