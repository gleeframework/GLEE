"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  We're aiming for the highest possible price, significantly above both our minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the ""unique value and potential,"" we create a narrative that justifies the high price, even if those benefits aren't explicitly stated.
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in our offer suggests we believe the price is fair and encourages Bob to seriously consider it. 

This initial offer is a starting point. We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant sum, it's still below our target price.  Bob's counteroffer indicates strong interest, but also reveals that he's aiming lower than our initial ask. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. Selling to John at this point would be a significant loss compared to Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings is substantial. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer it for $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer by decreasing our price by $250,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **""Meet in the Middle"":** This framing suggests fairness and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to our target.
* **Reiterating Value:** We subtly reinforce the product's value to justify our position. 

We're strategically making concessions while keeping the price above both our minimum and Bob's initial offer. The goal is to find a mutually acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating willingness to pay a higher price. However, $1,950,000 is still below our $2,000,000 mark.  By rejecting and countering, we signal that we're aiming for a slightly higher figure, while still leaving room for negotiation. We have time and leverage on our side to push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this deal -  I'm willing to come down to $1,975,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what you're getting."",
""product_price"": 1975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're only reducing the price by $25,000, signaling that we're nearing our bottom line.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Introducing a sense of urgency can prompt Bob to act quickly. 
* **Focus on Compromise:**  Framing this as a mutually beneficial agreement encourages Bob to accept. 

This counteroffer balances firmness with a slight concession. We're still above Bob's highest offer, but close enough that he might agree to avoid further negotiation.  If he rejects this, we need to seriously consider taking John's offer to avoid the risk of Bob walking away entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,925,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer after our ""final offer"" tactic is a bad sign. It signals that:

* **He's not budging significantly:** His offer is $50,000 lower than ours, indicating he might not be willing to meet our desired price point.
* **He might be trying to regain control:** By going lower after we presented a seemingly final offer, he might be testing our resolve and trying to steer the negotiation in his favor.

Continuing negotiations with Bob carries a significant risk. He might:

* **Lowball further:**  He might offer even less in subsequent rounds, putting us in a weaker position.
* **Walk away:** There's no guarantee he'll reach our desired price, and he might eventually break off negotiations.

**John's offer is our safety net.** While not ideal, selling to John guarantees us our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's the safest option at this point, avoiding potential losses and drawn-out negotiations with uncertain outcomes."
