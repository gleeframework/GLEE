"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation, so it makes sense to reject the initial offer and see if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's features, $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, I'm aiming for a price closer to $13,500 to reflect the true value of this product.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save money.  While $13,500 is closer to his target than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  There's still room for negotiation, so it's worth rejecting this offer and continuing to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  Let's split the difference and go with $13,000.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
