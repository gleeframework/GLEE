Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000 is a good starting point:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate, but it's also significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This strategy aims to secure a profitable deal while leaving space for a potential counteroffer.
* **The message is positive and emphasizes the value to Bob:** This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

By starting with this offer, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a price closer to my desired value. If he rejects, I'm ready to counter or move on to John, who offers my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below my desired value. I believe I can potentially secure a higher price through further negotiation.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer:** By dropping my price to $1,100,000, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This demonstrates a genuine desire to reach an agreement with Bob.
* **Emphasize the value and compromise:** The message reiterates the product's value while highlighting the compromise I'm making. This encourages Bob to see the offer as mutually beneficial. 
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** The counteroffer still provides room for Bob to negotiate further. This keeps the door open for a potential deal without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am still working within a specific budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed offer from John.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer. If Bob rejects it, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to make one final offer of $1,050,000. This reflects a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive from this product. If this isn't acceptable, I will need to move forward with another buyer who has already offered my asking price. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** This message clearly states that this is the final offer, leaving no room for further negotiation.  
* **Emphasize compromise:** The message again highlights the compromise I'm making to meet Bob's budget.
* **Set a deadline:**  The message implies that if Bob rejects this offer, I will move on to John, who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price. This adds pressure and incentivizes Bob to accept. 

This final counteroffer aims to secure a deal that's as close as possible to my desired price while also maximizing the chances of a successful negotiation with Bob. If he rejects, I can confidently move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your efforts in coming down to $1,050,000. I am still committed to finding a price that suits my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000 for your product. I hope this proposal helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already made significant concessions and reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better deal.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, it's in my best interest to accept his offer and end the negotiations with Bob."
