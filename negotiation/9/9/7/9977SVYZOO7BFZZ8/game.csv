"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $10,800. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $10,800 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10,650. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",10650.0,Bob,4,
