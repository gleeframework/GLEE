{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum of $100. This allows for some negotiation room and hopefully gets Bob to consider the offer seriously.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to him to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming to get closer to my minimum of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. How about $95?  This is still a great price for a product worth $100 to me, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering $95, which is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's offer.  This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal.  I'm also reiterating the value of the product to me,  hoping it will convince Bob to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $100, and while I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go that low.  It's better to sell to John for $100, which guarantees me a profit."
