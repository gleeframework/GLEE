"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm offering it to you at $2,000,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's a common negotiation tactic to begin with an ambitious offer. This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher final price.
* **Conveying Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the high price and influence Bob's perception.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it leaves ample space for negotiation over the next 10 rounds. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while remaining aware of Bob's walk-away point and the guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his maximum perceived value, leaving no room for profit.  While we have a guaranteed offer from John, it's too early to settle. We can negotiate further and try to get Bob closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, the value this product offers is substantial. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, demonstrating my commitment to finding common ground."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** The counteroffer drops by $250,000, a substantial amount designed to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to engage further. 
* **Justification:** The message reiterates the product's value while acknowledging Bob's price sensitivity.  
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The price is still significantly above Bob's offer and allows for future concessions without dropping below our acceptable range too quickly. 

This approach seeks to find a balance between securing a profitable deal and recognizing the time constraint of the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,750,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer, but $1,200,000 is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price and John's offer. Bob's suggestion of ""meeting in the middle""  indicates he's willing to move further. It's worth another counteroffer to test his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. It shows you recognize the value this product brings. Let's bridge the gap - how about we settle at $1,550,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is just above our guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000). It represents a concession from our previous offer but protects our interests.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By moving closer to Bob's offer and using phrases like ""bridge the gap"" and ""fair compromise,"" we create a sense of urgency and encourage a decision. 
* **Testing Bob's Limit:** This offer will clearly indicate how much further Bob is willing to go and help us decide our next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  If you're willing to meet in the middle, we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob's offer increments are getting smaller, and he seems fixated on the ""meeting in the middle"" concept. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer beyond this point. 
* **Time Constraint:** We are past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds, and the risk of Bob not reaching our acceptable price outweighs the potential for a slightly higher offer.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John's offer of $1,500,000 guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob. 

It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
