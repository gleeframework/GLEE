"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $11,000. This is a good starting point as it's still significantly higher than his perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to come up a bit closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm countering with $10,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable price and be willing to close the deal."
