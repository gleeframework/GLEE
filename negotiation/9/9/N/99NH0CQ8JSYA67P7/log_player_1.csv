Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it's also significantly higher than my minimum value of $100. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not eager to sell at that price. I'll try to counter with a higher price to see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125, a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a better price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $115 is only $15 less than my initial offer.  This is close enough to my preferred price that I'm willing to accept it and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
