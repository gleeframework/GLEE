"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and am interested in purchasing it. However, I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I want to work with you.  While $100 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a little. How about we meet in the middle at $115?  This gives you a great price and still allows me to cover my costs.  Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,3,
