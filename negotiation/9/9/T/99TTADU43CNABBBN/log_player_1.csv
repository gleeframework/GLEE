Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a fair price considering its potential, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm not satisfied with his current offer, I want to see if we can reach a middle ground. $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I believe there is still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is far below the value I've placed on it. I'm willing to compromise, but I need something closer to my initial offer. How about $12,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that offers value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but it's the same as what John is offering. Since there's no upside to negotiating further with Bob, I'll sell to John and avoid the risk of further rounds with Bob potentially ending in a lower price."
