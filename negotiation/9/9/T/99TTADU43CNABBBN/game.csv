"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a fair price considering its potential, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9000 is far below the value I've placed on it. I'm willing to compromise, but I need something closer to my initial offer. How about $12000? I'm confident this is a fair price that offers value for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,4,
