Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and framing the offer as fair, highlighting the product's value to Bob.

**Strategy:**

I want to get as close to my minimum price as possible while still being attractive to Bob. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I have a backup buyer (John) who will pay my minimum price, so I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'll aim for a price closer to $1,100,000 in my counteroffer. This will give Bob some room for negotiation but keep the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to the value I need to get.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm still being friendly and emphasizing the value Bob will get, but I'm also firm in my position. I'm proposing a ""middle ground"" that is closer to my goal.
* **Price:** I'm offering $1,050,000, which is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below my ideal. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while hopefully getting me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'll aim for a price close to $1,000,000 in my counteroffer. This will hopefully convince Bob to agree to a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm remaining firm but also showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price.
* **Price:** $1,000,000 is a reasonable compromise and brings me closer to my goal while still allowing some room for negotiation. 

**Strategy:** 
At this point, I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer.  If he rejects it again, I might have to consider selling to John, but I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'd like to propose a final counteroffer of $920,000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $920,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Selling to John is the best option:** Since Bob has stated he's willing to buy from John for $800,000, it's clear he won't go higher. Therefore, selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a much better outcome. 

**Conclusion:** While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, it's clear we're too far apart in our price expectations. Selling to John at this point is the most sensible decision to maximize my profits."
