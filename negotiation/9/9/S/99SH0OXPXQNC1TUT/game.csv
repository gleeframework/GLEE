"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to the value I need to get.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach a final agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'd like to propose a final counteroffer of $920,000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $800,000.",920000.0,Bob,6,
