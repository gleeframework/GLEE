"Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $11500. I believe this price reflects the value you would place on it, given its worth to you is $10000. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
