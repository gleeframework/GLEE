"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  This is my best offer, so let's see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,500 is close, but I need to get at least $11,000 for it to make sense.  This is a very fair offer for a product this good.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
