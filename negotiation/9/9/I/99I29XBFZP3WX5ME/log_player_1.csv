I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  This is a good starting point to see if Bob is genuinely interested and how high he's willing to go.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I don't want to settle for that right away. I'll see if I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer.  I need to gauge how serious Bob is about buying the product at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering $18,000.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

Bob's offer is $1,000 more than John's offer.  It's not the price I was initially hoping for, but it's still a good deal.  I'll accept the offer and finalize the sale with Bob."
