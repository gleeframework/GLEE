"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great start, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $11,000. This is a good price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $11,250. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
