"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $135. I'd be willing to pay $115 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?,115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I want to be fair. However, this product is worth a lot to me, and $115 is too low. My final offer is $125.  This is a very reasonable price for what you're getting.",125.0,Alice,5,
