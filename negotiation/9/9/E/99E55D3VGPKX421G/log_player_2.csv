"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire [Product Name] at a price that represents significant value. While I'm confident this product is worth at least $1200000 to you, I'm willing to let it go for a slightly lower price. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  I'm sure we can come to a mutually agreeable deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is asking for $1,000,000. This means you can still save money by rejecting her offer.
* **You have a backup option.**  You can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, so rejecting Alice's offer doesn't leave you empty-handed.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to save as much money as possible. By rejecting Alice's offer, you put pressure on her to lower her price.  If she wants to make a deal, she will have to come down in price."
