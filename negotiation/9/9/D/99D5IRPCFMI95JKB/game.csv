"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay closer to $1,000,000, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
