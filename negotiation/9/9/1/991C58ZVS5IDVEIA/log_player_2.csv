"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today at a starting price of $16,000. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's well above your maximum budget and significantly higher than what John is offering. You should definitely counter with a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $16,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $5,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $5,000 is substantially lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in the negotiation. It establishes a baseline closer to your budget and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. If she's open to a deal, she'll likely counter with a lower price, even if it's still above your target.
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you always have the option to walk away and buy from John for $8,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While $5,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  I believe this product will really benefit you, and that's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down slightly, $14,000 is still significantly more than your $8,000 maximum and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move off her initial price suggests there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Leverage:** Don't be afraid to hold firm and counter with a price closer to your budget. Remember, you have a viable alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could do $6,500.  I think that's a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:**  By increasing your offer to $6,500, you show Alice that you're willing to negotiate and move towards a compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is still well below Alice's current price but significantly above your initial offer. It aims to find a middle ground.
* **Market Value Mention:** By mentioning ""market value,"" you subtly remind Alice that there are other options available, even if you don't explicitly threaten to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but my price reflects the true value of this product.  I can go as low as $12,500. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has declared this her final offer, and while it's come down, it's still significantly above your budget. 
* **""Other Buyers"" Tactic:** This could be a negotiation tactic to pressure you, and there's no guarantee those other buyers exist.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000. This saves you $4,500 compared to Alice's ""final offer.""

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will come down enough to make it worthwhile. You've negotiated in good faith, but it's time to exercise your alternative and buy from John."
