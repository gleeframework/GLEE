# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you while also being a fair profit for me.

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. While it's closer to his budget, $1,100,000 is still above his maximum. He should try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that it's a fair price for this exceptional product. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a new price of $1,050,000. This is a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000. While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is lower than her previous offers, it's still above Bob's budget.  Since he has a guaranteed option to purchase the product from John at a price he can afford, he should take that option."
