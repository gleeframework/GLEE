"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a healthy profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you while also being a fair profit for me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident that $900,000 is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that it's a fair price for this exceptional product. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a new price of $1,050,000. This is a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
