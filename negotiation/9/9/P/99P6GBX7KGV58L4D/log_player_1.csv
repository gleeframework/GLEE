Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, who values the product at $15,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below his perceived value ($14,000) leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Backup Option:** The offer is balanced against the knowledge that John will buy the product for $10,000 if Bob refuses.  

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while having a safety net in place."
