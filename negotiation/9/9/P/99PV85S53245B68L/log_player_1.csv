"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, giving me some room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John for $150 if the deal with Bob falls through, so I don't want to set the price too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $150 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  He's starting at my minimum, and I have 9 more rounds to try to get a better price.  I'll see if I can convince him to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate, hopefully encouraging Bob to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $160 is closer to my desired price, I still believe there's room to negotiate. I'll see if I can convince him to go higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm going to counter with $170. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about getting a better price while also being flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're nearing the end of our rounds, and while I'd like to get even closer to $170, $165 is a good price and still significantly above my minimum.  I'm not sure I can convince Bob to go higher, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
