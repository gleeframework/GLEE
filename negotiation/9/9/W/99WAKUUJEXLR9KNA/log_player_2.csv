Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm a bit concerned that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,250?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $11,000. I can do $11,200, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.
