"Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm a bit concerned that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price. How about $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $11,000. I can do $11,200, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",11200.0,Alice,5,
