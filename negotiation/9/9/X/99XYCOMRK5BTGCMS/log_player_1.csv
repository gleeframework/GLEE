Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm interested in making a more competitive offer. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this price point strikes a balance, recognizing the product's worth while offering you a fair deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $950,000 is getting closer to a potential deal zone, I'm still leaving a significant amount of money on the table compared to John's offer. I'm willing to push Bob a bit further to see if he'll increase his offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. Let's make this simple - I'm willing to accept $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is very unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer would mean losing out on a substantial $280,000 compared to John's guaranteed purchase. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed deal with John."
