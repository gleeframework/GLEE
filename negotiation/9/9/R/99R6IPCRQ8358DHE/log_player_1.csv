"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($100).  This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential benefit to Bob. This might encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The price is not too far off from Bob's perceived value, leaving room for a potential compromise. 
* **Open-Ended:** I'm not putting pressure on Bob with a hard ""yes or no"" question. I want to see if he's interested in the product and give him a chance to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($100).
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation.  Bob's message indicates he's interested in the product, so there's a chance we can find a price that works for both of us. 
* **Time is on My Side:** We're only in round 2, and I have 8 rounds left to reach an agreement. I don't need to accept a deal that's unfavorable to me. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I want to maximize my profit. There's a possibility I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and encourages Bob to do the same. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone helps keep the negotiation amicable. It also reinforces my willingness to reach a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $95 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving space for potential counteroffers from Bob while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Focus on Value:** I subtly reiterate the value of the product by mentioning a ""good deal."" This encourages Bob to consider the product's worth.

**Next Step:** I'll wait for Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference at $90? I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, I'm considering the potential for future business with Bob.  A successful deal now could lead to more opportunities in the future.
* **Time Factor:** We're already in round 4, and time is running out. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I make a profit and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **John's Offer:** While John offers a guaranteed $100, the risk of losing the deal with Bob and having to negotiate with John later is not worth the extra $10. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer at $90 is the most strategic move at this stage. It ensures I get a reasonable price and avoids unnecessary risks and delays."
