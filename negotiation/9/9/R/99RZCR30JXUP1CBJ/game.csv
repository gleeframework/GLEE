"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and allows me to secure a profitable sale. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? It's a fair price for both of us, allowing you to secure a valuable asset at a competitive rate, and me to gain a good return on my investment.",975000.0,Alice,3,
