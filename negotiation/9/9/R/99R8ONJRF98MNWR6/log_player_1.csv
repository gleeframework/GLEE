"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. $12,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob or sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $12,000 is far below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $15,500? This would still be a great value for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your initial asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see that we're getting closer. However, $13,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy we're making progress. $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $13,500 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I believe I can get closer to my target price in the remaining rounds, and it's still worth the risk of losing the deal with Bob. If it doesn't work out, I can always sell to John for $15,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there! I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and my initial asking price. I'm confident this will be a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13750}
