{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us and allow for a smooth transaction. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice has only moved down $50,000 from her initial offer.  While this is a step in the right direction, it's still too high. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and aim for $1,075,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to push for a lower price, but I'm also showing willingness to compromise.  By offering $1,075,000, I'm meeting Alice halfway, while still keeping the price below my maximum.  This should encourage her to consider accepting my offer."

Alice has come down to $1,085,000, which is only $25,000 above my target price of $1,060,000.  At this point, it's a reasonable price for me and I'm confident that continuing to negotiate may not result in a significant price reduction.  I'm comfortable accepting the offer and finalizing the deal."
