"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product and think it's worth it, but I have to be mindful of my finances. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $16,000?  It's still a great deal for a product that you know is valuable to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14,500? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",14500.0,Bob,4,
