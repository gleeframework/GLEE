Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,800,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe its value to you could be even higher.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can we meet in the middle at $1600000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a lower price, but still higher than what I'd get from John.  I believe I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,700,000? This would still allow you to get a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1700000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1600000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $1650000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again -  let's settle on $1,675,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1675000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1675000 is too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1650000, as I mentioned before. Can we stick with that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting very close to what I'm willing to accept.  I'm worried that if I reject this offer, he might walk away entirely, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal from him in the remaining rounds. It's also worth noting that I'm approaching the point where selling to John might be more appealing. So, I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
