Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I aim to get as close to the product's value to me ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly lower than my absolute bottom line allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate upwards if he's very interested. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"", I aim to encourage Bob to act quickly and accept my offer.
* **Backup Plan:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for my minimum acceptable price."
