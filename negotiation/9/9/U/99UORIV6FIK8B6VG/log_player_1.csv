Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him a reason to consider it, but also leaves room for negotiation if he counters.  It's also below my minimum acceptable price, so I can still get a decent return if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $110. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105?  That's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
