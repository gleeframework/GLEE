"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its market value.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",10500.0,Alice,3,
