"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $135. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're sticking to your budget, Bob, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $132.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",132.5,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in finding a middle ground. Given my budget constraints, I would like to stick with $120 as the price. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product. I hope you can agree to this price.",120.0,Bob,6,
