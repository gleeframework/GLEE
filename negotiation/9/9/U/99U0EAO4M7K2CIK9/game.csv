"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a great compromise and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to make one more compromise - how about we meet at $125? It's still a bit higher than your budget, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
