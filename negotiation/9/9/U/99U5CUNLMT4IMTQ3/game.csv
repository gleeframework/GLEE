"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it still allows you to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
