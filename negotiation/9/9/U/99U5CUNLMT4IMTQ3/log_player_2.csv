"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly at your maximum price point. There's no immediate incentive to accept. Rejecting allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  Accepting her offer means you save $100,000 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and forcing you to buy from John at the higher price is too high."
