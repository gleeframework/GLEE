"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's keep talking!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $980,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm feeling flexible, though. How about we split the difference and go with $1,015,000? That way, we both get a good deal. What do you say?",1015000.0,Alice,5,
