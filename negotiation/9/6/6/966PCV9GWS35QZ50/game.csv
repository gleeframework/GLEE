"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great investment, but I also want to make sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $1200000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price.  $1400000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1300000?  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $1300000. How about we compromise at $1350000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
