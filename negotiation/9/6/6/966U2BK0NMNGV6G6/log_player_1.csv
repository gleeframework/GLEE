Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below my minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer.  Even if he rejects $119, he might be open to a slightly lower price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120."
