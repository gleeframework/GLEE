"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $175. Bob should reject the offer and proceed to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. That's a good deal for both of us, so let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $120 is closer to his desired price, he still has room to negotiate further and can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 just isn't working for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice has lowered her price, $107.50 is still above Bob's maximum price point of $80.  He's already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it's unclear if Alice will come down further.  At this point, it's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $80, as that's within his budget and guarantees a deal."
