# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Alice is very unlikely to go lower than $13,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John."
