"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,400,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's try to find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
