Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. My initial offer is $1,750,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired value for the product. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,400,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm happy to accept it.  It's better than selling to John for the same price, as I'd prefer to keep the negotiation going with Bob."
