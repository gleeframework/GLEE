"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $14000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for cheaper from John.  You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, as she is likely willing to go lower than $14,000 to make a sale."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $12500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13250?  I'm confident this would be a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it is lower than her initial price, you can still get the product for a lower price from John. You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice again.  She has already shown she is willing to negotiate, so you should be able to get her down to a price closer to your budget."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $13,250 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really hoping to keep it under $13,000.  Would you be willing to go down to $12,800?  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12800}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $13000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer, as I'm confident the product is worth more than that.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

While $13,000 is closer to your budget, it's still not ideal. You can get the product from John for $12,000, saving you $1,000. It's better to go with the sure deal and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
