,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, but I think it's a bit above my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $9,000 is significantly below my bottom line. Could you do $11,000?  I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering the value this product offers.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
