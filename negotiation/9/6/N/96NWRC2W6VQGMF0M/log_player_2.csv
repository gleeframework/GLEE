"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $120 is a better price than John's $100, you can do better. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a lower price."
