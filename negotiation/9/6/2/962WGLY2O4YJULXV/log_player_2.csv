"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm offering it to you for $11,500. I think this is a very fair price considering what you gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  By rejecting, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price in the subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet halfway at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's target price. Even though it's a slight improvement from her initial offer, Bob has already rejected a higher price, and it's unlikely he'll settle for a price that's more than his maximum. He has 7 rounds remaining, and there's still room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still too high.  I'm really serious about getting this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,750?  That's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,750 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a bit more. Would you consider $10,900? I'm trying to find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but $10,900 is still slightly above his comfort zone. He has 5 rounds left and can continue to try and negotiate down. There's still room to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, I'm committed to getting this product, but $10,900 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $10,800.  I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 10800}
