"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm asking for $1,600,000 to start negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $1,600,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I believe this product's true value is reflected in a higher price point.  Would you consider $1,450,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do even better. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. Can you consider this offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
