"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
It's better to try negotiating a lower price with Alice first.  Alice's starting offer is significantly above your maximum valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) than Alice's initial price ($9,500). This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still potentially stay well below my $8,000 limit.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message is framed politely and expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,750. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate.  It's worth seeing if we can get closer to $7,000 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with. Could you do $6,800?  At that price, I'm ready to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 6800}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer, but not dramatically. This shows Alice I'm willing to move towards her price, but not without further negotiation.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating ""at that price, I'm ready to make a deal,"" I'm signaling that this is a serious offer and might be my final one before considering John's offer more seriously. 
* **Still Below Valuation:**  This offer keeps me well below my $8,000 maximum, leaving room for a potential final counter from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad to hear that $6,800 is getting closer to your budget. I'm willing to meet you at $7,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

We're getting very close! Alice is now only $800 above our ideal price.  We'll make one more counteroffer before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're almost there!  I can do $7,000 even for this. That's really my limit, but I'm ready to finalize things at that price."", ""product_price"": 7000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This message conveys a sense of urgency and finality. It signals to Alice that this is likely the best offer she'll get from me.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  We're meeting her more than halfway between her previous offer ($7,200) and my last counteroffer ($6,800).
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  By emphasizing my $8,000 alternative with John, I'm subtly reminding Alice that I have other options if we can't reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is your limit, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you at $7,100. This is a small compromise, but I think it's worth it to get a deal done. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

It's time to accept.  Alice is unlikely to come down further, and we've managed to save $900 compared to John's offer.  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush!"
