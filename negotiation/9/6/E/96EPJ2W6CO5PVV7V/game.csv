"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,750. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad to hear that $6,800 is getting closer to your budget. I'm willing to meet you at $7,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is your limit, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you at $7,100. This is a small compromise, but I think it's worth it to get a deal done. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7100.0,Alice,7,
