Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it might be rejected. This sets a high baseline and gives me room to negotiate.  I'm confident the product is worth more to Bob than $800,000, so I'm aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer, potentially leading to a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer to be more appealing to Bob, but still holding firm at a price that's significantly higher than what I'd get from John. I'm aiming for a compromise that allows us both to feel good about the deal."
