"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal than $1,200,000. You have no information on Alice's minimum acceptable price, so there's a possibility of getting a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This establishes a strong negotiating position and forces Alice to reveal more about her willingness to negotiate.  If Alice rejects this offer, I can adjust my subsequent counteroffers based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant reduction from her initial price of $1,200,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and potentially ending the negotiation increases. Accepting her offer at this point secures a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a significantly higher price."
