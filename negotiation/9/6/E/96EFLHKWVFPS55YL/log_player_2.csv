"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob has a better option to buy from John for $800,000, but there's still room for negotiation with Alice.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as close to his maximum budget as possible. Offering $800,000 is a bold move, but it's his best chance of securing the product at a price he's comfortable with.  There's a chance Alice might accept it, or at least counter with a price closer to Bob's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is still within Bob's budget, and it's a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice, securing the product at a reasonable price."
