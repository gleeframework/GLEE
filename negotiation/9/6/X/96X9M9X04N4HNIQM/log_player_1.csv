**Reasoning:**

Bob seems stuck at $7,500 and has not budged significantly from that price point.  While continuing negotiations is possible, it's unlikely Bob will suddenly jump to $8,500 or higher. Accepting his offer means a $2,500 loss compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut losses and secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
