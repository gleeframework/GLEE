"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal, you can potentially save even more money by making a counteroffer.  You know John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, so you have a target price in mind."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer again.  You're still within range of getting the product for less than $1,075,000, which is your goal.  Since you know John will sell for $1,000,000, you have a clear target price to aim for."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer. Let's settle on $1,068,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's the best we can do. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at $1,000,000.  Alice's offer of $1,068,750 is still within your budget and a decent price considering you've already negotiated a significant discount."
