"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and your desired sale price.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than your offer. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the fact that you are clearly motivated to sell.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
