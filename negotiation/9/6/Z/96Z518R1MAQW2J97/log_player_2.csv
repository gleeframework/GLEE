{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $850,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if there's any wiggle room in Alice's price.  $600,000 is a significant discount from her initial offer, but it's still within the range I'm comfortable paying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has moved slightly closer to my counteroffer, but $750,000 is still a bit high. I'll reject and try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $650,000.  This is still a significant discount from Alice's last offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a good deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with Alice's offer. While she's coming down in price, I think we can get closer to my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 675000}
``` 

I'm raising my offer again to $675,000,  showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still want a price closer to my ideal. I'm hoping this will push us towards a deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm going to reject and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 690000}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm increasing my offer by $15,000, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go much higher.  I hope this will be enough to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $695,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $695,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $695,000, which is only $5,000 more than my last offer.  Given that we're down to the last round, it's worth accepting this offer.  While I would have preferred to pay $690,000, saving $805,000 from John's offer is a significant win."
