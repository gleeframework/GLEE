Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to compromise, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $11,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $12,250. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250.

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $12,000, and we have a guaranteed option with John at that price.  We've played the negotiation game well, but it's not worth risking a higher price at this point."
