Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in buying the product for $110. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than nothing, I can do better. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  How about $115? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it allows you to make a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
