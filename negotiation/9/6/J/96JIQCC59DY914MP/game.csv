"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $75?  That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $100. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $100 is still a little too high for me.  I can do $80, which is my final offer. ",80.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'll make one more offer: I'll sell it to you for $110. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",110.0,Alice,7,
