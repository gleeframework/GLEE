"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair price. How about $95?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested, but I can only go up to $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. Considering the value of the product, I can't agree to $85. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. How about we settle at $87?  This would be a good price for both of us.",87.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. How about we set the price at $89? This is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",89.0,Alice,5,
