"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the offer of $9,000.  I'm still a bit away from my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering you the product for $9,250.  This is a fair price, considering the value you'll gain from the product. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a more significant reduction. I'm willing to offer $8,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet at this price.",8750.0,Bob,6,
