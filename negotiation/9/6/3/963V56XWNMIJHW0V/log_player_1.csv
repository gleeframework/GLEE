""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,400,000. I know how valuable it could be for you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible without going over.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some wiggle room in case Bob tries to negotiate a slightly lower price.
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:** Offering a price too close to John's offer ($1,200,000) might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could lead to him walking away.

By starting high but still within a reasonable range, we increase the chances of securing a deal with Bob at a price that significantly benefits us."
