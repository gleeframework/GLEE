"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 isn't quite there yet. How about $13,250? It's a small increase, but it gets us closer to a deal. We're both invested in finding a solution that works for both of us, and I'm confident this price is fair for the product's value to you.",13250.0,Alice,7,
