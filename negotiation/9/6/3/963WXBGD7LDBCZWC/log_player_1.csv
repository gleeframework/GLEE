Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $100. It's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Knowing your worth:** You know John will buy it for $80, so you have a safety net.  This allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob.
* **Leaving Bob room to accept:** While $100 is more than Bob values the product at, it's not an outrageous markup. There's a chance he might accept outright."
