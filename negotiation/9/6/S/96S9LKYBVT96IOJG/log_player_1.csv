"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more so than mine. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a strong offer that leans towards your ideal outcome. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Acknowledging Value:** By stating that the product might be worth even more to Bob, we are subtly justifying the high price and piquing his interest. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message emphasizes that this is an ""initial proposal,"" clearly signaling that you are open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This aligns more closely with my assessment of the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob's counteroffer was a significant jump down, indicating he's willing to move on price.  We have room to negotiate further and aim for a higher price closer to his perceived value of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  It seems we both agree this product has significant value. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,275,000. This reflects the product's potential while acknowledging your perspective on its current value."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** We start by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and finding common ground (the product's value). This helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Strategic Concession:** We're coming down in smaller increments ($75,000) from our initial offer, signaling that we're willing to negotiate but still value the product highly.
* **Justification:** We're still anchoring the price close to our initial offer by reiterating the product's potential,  justifying the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I understand the value you see in the product, I would like to counter with an offer of $1,250,000. This price better aligns with my assessment of its worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,250,000 is a very good offer, representing a significant profit above our minimum of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Pattern:** Bob's concessions are getting smaller ($200,000 then $50,000), suggesting he's nearing his maximum price.
* **Time Value:** We still have several rounds left, but there's a risk that pushing Bob too hard could make him walk away. Accepting now secures a great deal."
