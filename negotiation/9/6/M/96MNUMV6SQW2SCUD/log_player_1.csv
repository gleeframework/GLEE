Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $8,500 is still below my minimum, and I think I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's still a great price for you, and it gives me a little closer to what I'm hoping for. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8200 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to accept and get something rather than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find some middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles.  I really want to make this work, but $8,200 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $8,750. That's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough one.  While Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum, I'm starting to feel like I'm not going to get much more from him. It's been several rounds and we're not closing the gap. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $8,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially losing even more time and not getting any closer to a deal."
