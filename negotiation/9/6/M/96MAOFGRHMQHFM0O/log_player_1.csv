Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob. Since we know John will buy it for $10,000, that's our absolute minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing above the $10,000 mark. 
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,""  we might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially accept the offer before thinking too much about it.

**Important Note:** While this strategy aims to maximize profit, there's a chance Bob might find the price too high and reject it outright.  However, the risk is calculated since there's a guaranteed buyer at $10,000."
