"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I really like the product, $9000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $8200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $8200 is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still a little hesitant. I'm willing to pay $8000, which is the maximum I can afford. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you at $8100, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,5,
