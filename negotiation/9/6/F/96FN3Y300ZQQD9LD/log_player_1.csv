I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will likely counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to gauge his interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer meets my minimum value, it doesn't leave me any room for profit. I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $1,350,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still allows me to earn a profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price, especially since it's higher than his initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and closer to my desired price point.  I'm going to accept it."
