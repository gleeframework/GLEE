"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $92. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $92. How about we split the difference and go with $88? I'm confident we can close the deal at that price.",88.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $88. I'm offering the product to you for $90. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",90.0,Alice,5,
