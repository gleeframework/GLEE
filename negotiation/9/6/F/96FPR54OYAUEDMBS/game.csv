,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. How about $950,000? This gives you a good price and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a middle ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $950,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting a good deal.  Let's try $925,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's closer to your offer.  I'm confident we can find common ground.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for staying with me on this.  $925,000 is getting close, but I need to be around $900,000. Would you consider $890,000? I think that's a very fair offer.",890000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's split the difference. How about $905,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.  Let's make it happen.",905000.0,Alice,7,
