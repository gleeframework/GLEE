This is a good deal for you, Bob. Here's why:

* **You're saving money:**  You're getting the product for $95,000 less than John's offer.
* **Alice is motivated:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and meet you closer to your price range.
* **Limited time:** You have limited rounds, and continuing to push for a lower price might make Alice less willing to negotiate. 

While you might be able to get it slightly lower, the risk of losing the deal and having to go with John's offer is probably not worth it at this point."
