"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This allows me to stay within my financial limits while still acquiring the product. Please let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I still need to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $960,000.
