,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, how about $10,500? This would still leave you with a good deal considering the product's value. Let's find a way to make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,500? This would allow me to make a fair profit and hopefully, it's a price you can work with.",9500.0,Alice,5,
