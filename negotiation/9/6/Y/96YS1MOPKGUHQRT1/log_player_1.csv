"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a unique piece with a lot of value, and I believe this price reflects that. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000. I will try to negotiate with Bob in the next round to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, how about $10,500? This would still leave you with a good deal considering the product's value. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for countering. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, how about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not quite there. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by counter-offering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,500? This would allow me to make a fair profit and hopefully, it's a price you can work with."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're really close.  I can do $9,250 to make this work. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although $9,250 is still slightly below my minimum price, it's getting very close. I've had a few rounds of negotiation with Bob and it's possible he won't budge further.  Accepting his offer is the best option to secure a sale and avoid further risk of losing the deal."
