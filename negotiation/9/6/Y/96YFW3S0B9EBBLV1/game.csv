"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $925,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, and we can both walk away happy with the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're continuing to work together. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $925,000 yet. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I understand your position, but $980,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",950000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're still negotiating. However, I'm not willing to go below $990,000. I think this is the minimum price I can accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,9,
