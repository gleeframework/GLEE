"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I can't accept $850,000. It's significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $900,000.  This price is fair and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I still think $900,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $875,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
