"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value you'll get from owning this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly better than buying from John.**  You'd save $550,000 by accepting.
* **Even though you value the product at $1,500,000, you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000.**  Alice's offer is well within that range."
