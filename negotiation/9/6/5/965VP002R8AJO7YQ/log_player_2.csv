"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $9,000 is a tempting offer, the value this product brings is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget.
