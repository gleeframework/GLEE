"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to go with your backup plan and buy from John for $8,000."
