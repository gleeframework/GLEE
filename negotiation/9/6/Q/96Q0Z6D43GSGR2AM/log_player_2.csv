You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above your maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum price. This is a strong opening counteroffer as it directly communicates my budget and creates immediate pressure on Alice to either accept or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,000,000 is still above my budget.  It's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to my desired price.  Therefore, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John at $800,000, ensuring I stay within my budget and avoid further negotiations."
