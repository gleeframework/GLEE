Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This is a high starting offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also reflects the fact that Bob is willing to pay a significantly higher price than my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm not willing to sell to John yet as $13,500 is closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,750. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I believe it's a fair price that still allows me to earn a good profit while giving Bob a chance to get a better deal than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's not that far from my minimum, I'm hoping to get a slightly better price.  I'm not willing to sell to John yet, but I'm running out of room for negotiation. If the next round doesn't get me a good price, I'll probably have to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13400}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm dropping the price a bit more, but I'm not willing to go lower than this. If Bob rejects it, I'll have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  I'm going to sell to John. While it's not the ideal price, it's still better than risking further negotiation with Bob."
