"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my potential profit.  Since Bob values the product at $80, he may be willing to negotiate. I'll be ready to adjust if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $85.  This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, Bob will see that it's a fair price considering his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob is clearly not willing to go higher than $75. It's better to accept his offer and get $75 than risk another rejection and potentially end up selling to John for $80."
