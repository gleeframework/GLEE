"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $1,150,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,150,000 still falls short of what I need to accept.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $1,250,000. This is my best possible price. If you're serious about acquiring the product, I urge you to consider this offer. ",1250000.0,Alice,5,
