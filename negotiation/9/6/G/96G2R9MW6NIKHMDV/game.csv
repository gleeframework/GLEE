"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, considering it's worth $100 to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's see if we can finalize this.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet at $102? It's still a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",102.0,Alice,5,
