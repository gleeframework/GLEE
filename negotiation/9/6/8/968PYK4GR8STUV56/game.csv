"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this work.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $725,000 is still too low. How about we split the difference at $800,000?  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find the product extremely valuable. Let's finalize this deal!",800000.0,Alice,5,
