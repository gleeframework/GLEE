Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the asset, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I still think $900,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to that number. How about we discuss $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Let's keep negotiating. Bob is showing willingness to move closer to my price point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $1 million."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. It seems we both see the value in this asset. To meet you closer to your number, how about we settle on $975,000?  I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be closer to $950,000. How about we discuss $960,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly anchored around $950,000 and  moving up in smaller increments. Accepting $960,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling."
