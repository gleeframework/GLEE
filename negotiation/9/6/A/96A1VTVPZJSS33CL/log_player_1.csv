{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:**  $115 is more than $100, so Bob has an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  $115 is below your minimum of $120, giving you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  Bob understands exactly what's being offered. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, you're establishing a strong starting position and creating an opportunity for Bob to negotiate. This approach is likely to lead to a successful transaction with a price closer to your desired $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, selling for $100 would be below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'd be better off rejecting his offer and trying to negotiate a higher price. I have the option to sell to John for $120, so I don't need to settle for a lower price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to continue negotiating and that $100 is not acceptable. This should encourage Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $100 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This would still be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to compromise while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Justification:** I've provided a reason for my price, appealing to the ""good deal"" aspect for both parties. 
* **Clear Next Step:**  I'm clearly asking for Bob's response, keeping the negotiation moving forward.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that's both reasonable for Bob and profitable for me. It's a strategic move that keeps the negotiations open and encourages a potential agreement."
