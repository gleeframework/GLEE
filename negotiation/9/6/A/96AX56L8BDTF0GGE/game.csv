"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,500. It's the best I can do at this point.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  To be honest, $12,000 is the very most I can afford.  If you're able to do that, I'm ready to close the deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is your absolute maximum, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already gone quite low, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and my original offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,000. It's the best I can do at this point.",13000.0,Alice,7,
