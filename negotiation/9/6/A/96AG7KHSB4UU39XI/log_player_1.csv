Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $800,000 (from John's offer)
* **Bob's maximum willingness to pay:** $1,000,000
* **Negotiation space:**  $200,000 
* **Optimal Offer:** Offering $950,000 gives me a good profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider. It leaves room for a potential negotiation, but also secures a price significantly higher than my minimum."
