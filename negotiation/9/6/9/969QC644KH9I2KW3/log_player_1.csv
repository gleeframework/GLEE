"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with an ambitious offer significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high initial price without revealing specific details. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By calling it a ""starting point,"" we signal our willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:** Set a high reference point in Bob's mind.
2. **Gather Information:**  Observe Bob's reaction to assess his willingness to pay.
3. **Maximize Potential Profit:** Aim for a price as close to $1,600,000 as possible while remaining open to a deal that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is a significant increase from his initial perceived value, it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. We have room to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable outcome.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, we signal that we're serious about the product's value and are willing to walk away from a deal that doesn't meet our needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is considerably below my bottom line.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down significantly. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:**  We've made a substantial concession from our initial offer, signaling flexibility and a desire to reach a deal. 
* **Justification:** The phrase ""considerably below my bottom line"" emphasizes that we're making a sacrifice while avoiding revealing our absolute minimum price.
* **Middle Ground:** Proposing $1,350,000 positions the offer as a compromise, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with movement on his end. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maintain Value:** We're still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's offer and above our minimum.
2. **Encourage Reciprocity:** Our concession prompts Bob to make a meaningful counteroffer.
3. **Progress Negotiations:** We're moving closer to a potential agreement while retaining leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is now significantly above our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While we could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, the risk of Bob walking away increases. 

Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids:

* **Potential Stalemate:** Further negotiation might lead to smaller concessions and a prolonged process.
* **Losing the Deal:** Bob could decide the price is no longer worthwhile and withdraw.

This acceptance prioritizes a highly favorable outcome over the pursuit of a potentially marginally better, but less certain, deal."
