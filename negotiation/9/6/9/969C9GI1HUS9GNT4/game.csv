"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I can offer.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like your persistence! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,750. I can do $13,000, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to my limit, how about $12,000 even? This is a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I think we're getting close! However, I was hoping to get a bit more out of this deal. I can do $12,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's a great price for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,7,
