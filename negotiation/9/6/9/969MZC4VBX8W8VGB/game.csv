"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $10,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,750 is getting closer to your target, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
