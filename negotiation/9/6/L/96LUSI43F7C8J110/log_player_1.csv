{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $15,000. I believe it's a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly beneficial. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but not outrageous. It allows for some negotiation space, while also signaling the value I place on the product.  I'll be prepared to adjust the price based on Bob's response and my assessment of his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than the initial offer I made. I believe I can get a better price from Bob, and I'm willing to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm offering a compromise, meeting Bob halfway.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer."
