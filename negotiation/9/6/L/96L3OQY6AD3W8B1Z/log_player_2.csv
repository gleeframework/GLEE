"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer at this point. You have no information about Alice's minimum acceptable price. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price is a good strategy. This sets a lower bound and allows for more negotiation room.  It's also possible that Alice is willing to sell for a lower price, and this counteroffer will initiate that process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your desired price point. There's still room to negotiate further. Rejecting and counter-offering keeps the negotiation process going and potentially leads to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by reducing her price.  Increasing your counteroffer to $1,200,000 shows that you're serious about purchasing the product while still leaving room for further negotiation. This counteroffer is a reasonable midpoint between your previous offer and Alice's current offer."
