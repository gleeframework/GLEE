"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price is fair considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000. I understand the value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise, and it still leaves you a substantial margin for profit.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for both of us to make a profit.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,012,500? It's a fair compromise, and it keeps us both within a reasonable margin.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
