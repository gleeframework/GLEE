# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what the product is worth to her. This means there's room for negotiation and potential savings.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to consider the value I've placed on the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,225,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, while also showing some flexibility on my part.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has shown some flexibility, her counteroffer is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable paying. There's still some wiggle room to negotiate a lower price, so I'll reject her offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."

This is a fair price that acknowledges the value we both see, and hopefully, it's a starting point we can both work with."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and gets me closer to my target.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my target price, and her offer is still significantly lower than what John is offering.  At this point, it's in my best interest to accept the offer and secure the product for a good price.  There's a good chance I could continue negotiating, but the risk of Alice walking away or me getting a worse deal from John outweighs the potential savings."
