"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and I'm confident he'll see the value of the product at that price.  If he rejects, we'll see what he's willing to offer.  I'm keeping John in mind as my safety net if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I won't settle for less than what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm coming down to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum price and hopefully a more acceptable price for Bob. I'm aiming for a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still too low. I'm not willing to settle for less than what the product is worth to me, even with only 6 rounds left. I'll counteroffer again, hoping we can reach an agreement before I have to resort to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's a reasonable price for both of us. It's still above my minimum price, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair deal. If not, I'll have to start seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum price.  I don't have much room to negotiate with only four rounds left.  I'm going to sell to John to ensure I get my minimum price."
