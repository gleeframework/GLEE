"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,500 is below my minimum value, and I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what it's worth to me. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it's still a price that I'm comfortable with. I believe this offer is fair and likely to be accepted by Bob."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm counteroffering with $10,500.  This is a small increase from my last offer and is still a reasonable price that I think Bob might accept. I'm hoping to reach a deal with Bob without having to sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
