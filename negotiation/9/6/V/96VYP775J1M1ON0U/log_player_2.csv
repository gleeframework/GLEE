# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

You can do better than $110. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$107.50 is a good price, and it's still within your budget. There's a chance you could negotiate lower, but it's not guaranteed.  It's best to secure the deal at this price."
