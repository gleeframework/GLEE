"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a special opportunity tailored for valued individuals like yourself, considering its immense worth of $12,000 to you. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $14,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
