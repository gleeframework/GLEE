Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin if you sell to Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high enough to capture a significant portion of that profit margin, but not so high that Bob would rather walk away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for your operations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This represents a fair deal considering its potential impact on your business."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You acknowledge the value to Bob, building a positive foundation.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves you with a $150,000 profit above your fallback, and Bob with a $50,000 gain compared to his alternative.
* **Justification:** By framing the price as ""fair"" and highlighting the ""potential impact,"" you encourage Bob to accept.

**Important Note:** This is a single offer. Depending on Bob's personality and negotiation style, you might need to adjust your strategy in subsequent rounds."
