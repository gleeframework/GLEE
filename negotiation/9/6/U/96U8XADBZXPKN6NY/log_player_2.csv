"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is within his budget, it's not the best deal. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is great, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  He's offering $850,000, which is still above his maximum budget, but it leaves room for further negotiation.  This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $875,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise. It's within Bob's budget and closer to his initial counteroffer.  While he could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or the deal falling through entirely is higher. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product and saves a significant amount compared to Alice's initial offer."
