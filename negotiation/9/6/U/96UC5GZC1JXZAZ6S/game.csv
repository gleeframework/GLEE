"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to at least get $900,000 for the product. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value it brings. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit shy of your target. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but that's the highest I can go. Can we meet in the middle at $925,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to at least receive $900,000 for the product.  This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get out of it.  Let's try to make this work.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose $825,000 as a compromise. Can we make a deal at this price?",825000.0,Bob,6,
