"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a solution that works for both of us. To offer more flexibility, I am proposing a payment plan option for the product. Instead of paying the full amount upfront, you can pay $120 now and the remaining $20 within two months. This way, you can secure the product at a price slightly above your initial proposal, while spreading out the cost over time.",120.0,Alice,3,
