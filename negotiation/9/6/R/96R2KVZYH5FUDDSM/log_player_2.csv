"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is starting at $1,300,000.  There's room for negotiation.
* **Rejection allows for counter-offers.** By rejecting, you can attempt to get a better price in subsequent rounds. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** This option is only desirable if you fail to reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential,  $1,300,000 is a bit high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price, demonstrating your serious intent to negotiate.  
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** $1,100,000 is still above Alice's minimum value, giving her incentive to counter.
* **Sets a clear target:** This counteroffer establishes your upper limit, making it easier to track progress in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 represents a fair price considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above your desired price.**  While her offer is lower than the initial price, it's still higher than your target of $1,100,000. 
* **Further negotiation is likely.** Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, so there's potential to get closer to your target price.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.**  This option remains only if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,225,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This shows I'm serious about buying, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate increase:** This counteroffer is a smaller increase than the previous round, indicating a more measured approach. 
* **Testing the waters:**  It's a test to see if Alice is willing to meet you halfway or if she's more committed to a price closer to her last offer.
* **Staying within budget:** This offer remains comfortably within your budget, keeping the deal viable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm aiming for a deal that works for both of us.  How about we meet halfway at $1,187,500?  This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,187,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,187,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer, but still not there yet.**  $1,187,500 is closer to your target price of $1,100,000, but it's still slightly above your comfort zone.
* **More room for negotiation.** Since both of you are moving closer, there's still a reasonable chance to reach a price that works for both parties. 
* **Buying from John remains a last resort.** The negotiation is progressing well, and you have a chance to secure a better price than what John is offering."
