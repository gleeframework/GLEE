This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a strong incentive to accept.  It also opens the conversation with a positive and collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my target."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the full potential of this product.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I believe I can still push for a higher price.  I'm not ready to settle for the $1,000,000 offer from John just yet."

Bob's last offer is too low. I've made multiple concessions, and it seems like we're at an impasse. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum.  I'll accept John's offer to ensure I receive a reasonable price for my product."
