"Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000, a price that reflects its worth while giving you a significant opportunity for profit. Let's discuss this further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the full potential of this product.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again?  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a win for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,250,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
