"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed and crafted to meet your needs. It's a true testament to quality and value, and I believe it's worth every penny of its $100 price tag. Given its exceptional worth, I am extending this exclusive offer to you at the same price. Don't miss out on this opportunity to own something truly special. If you're interested, please let me know so we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay $100 for the product from John, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer at the same price. By rejecting, you maintain the option to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice later or stick with John's offer."
