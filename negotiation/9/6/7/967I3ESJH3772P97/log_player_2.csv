# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that's significantly below its market value.  While I value it at over $1.5 million, I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a fantastic deal for you, as you've indicated it's worth $800,000 to you.  Think about the potential return on investment here.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
