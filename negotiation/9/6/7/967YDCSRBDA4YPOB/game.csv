"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your budget, I'm not able to go down to $10,000 at this point.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives you a good deal as well.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
