{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a good deal. He is offering $12,000, which is still significantly lower than Alice's asking price but higher than Alice's minimum value. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product while still aiming for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
