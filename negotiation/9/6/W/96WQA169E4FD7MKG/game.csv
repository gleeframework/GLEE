"Thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the suggestion, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $120 or less. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're on a tight budget, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $140, that's my minimum. But I'm willing to throw in a free accessory with the purchase if you're willing to meet me at that price.",140.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my request, but I'm still hoping to stay within my budget of $130 or less. I'm not sure if the free accessory justifies the additional $10. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between?",130.0,Bob,8,
