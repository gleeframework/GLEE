Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've researched and the market demand. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a strong reluctance to meet near your minimum acceptable price.  He's consistently aiming for a price significantly below your valuation. At this point, continuing negotiations risks losing more potential profit without a guarantee of reaching an agreement. 

It's in your best interest to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, rather than risk a lower final offer from Bob or a failed negotiation."
