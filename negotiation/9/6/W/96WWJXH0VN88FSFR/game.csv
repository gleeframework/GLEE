"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $120. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $145. This is a good price considering its value to you is $120. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and settle on $132.50?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest offer. I'll sell the product to you for $140. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $120. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
