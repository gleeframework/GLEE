{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a fantastic deal and I know you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. By being friendly and highlighting the value of the product, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to negotiate rather than outright reject.  I'll be prepared to counter if he does, but also know I have John as a backup if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $10,000.  While I could sell to John for $10,000, I'm going to try and counter Bob. There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price, and even if not, I can always fall back on John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,800 is my absolute bottom line.  This is a high-quality product, and I believe it's worth the investment.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500 again. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has stuck to his original offer of $9,500, which is below my minimum.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee he'll budge, and I'm already at risk of wasting time. It's time to secure the guaranteed sale to John for $10,000."
