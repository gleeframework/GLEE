"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value to me. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm proposing a new price of $950000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this amazing product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875000, which is still a good deal considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $875000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $925000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this amazing product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
