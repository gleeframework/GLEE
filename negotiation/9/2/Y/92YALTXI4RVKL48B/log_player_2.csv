"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10500. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Bob can get the product for $8,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
