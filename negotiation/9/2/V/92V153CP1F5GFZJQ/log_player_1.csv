Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob while still ensuring a significant profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly."
