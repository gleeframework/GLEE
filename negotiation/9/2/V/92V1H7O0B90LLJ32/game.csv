Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get your hands on this fantastic item. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?,120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I'll give you a deal for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate a bit.  How about we make this our final offer - I'll do $98 and we can get this deal done. ",98.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm not willing to give up on this deal just yet. I'll meet you at $102, and that's my final offer. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,7,
