,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your position, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. Let's meet in the middle, what do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95, which is the maximum I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $100 for a final offer. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
