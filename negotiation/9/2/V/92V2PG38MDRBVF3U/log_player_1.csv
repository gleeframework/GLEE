"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $110, which is higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but not excessively so. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the value to Bob (""great deal"", ""very useful"") to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, leaving the door open for Bob to engage and potentially counteroffer. 

This approach balances my goal of maximizing profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum value ($100), I'm not in a rush to sell.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  Show Bob that I'm serious about getting a better price.
* **Gather More Information:**  See if Bob is willing to go higher in future rounds.
* **Explore John as a Backup:**  If Bob won't meet my expectations, I have the option to sell to John for $100. 

I'll counter with a price closer to $100 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your position, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. Let's meet in the middle, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($90). 
* **Show Flexibility:** The message emphasizes my willingness to compromise (""come down"") and suggests finding a mutually agreeable solution (""meet in the middle"").
* **Reiterate Value:** The message reminds Bob of the product's value by asking him to consider his perspective (""what do you think?"").

This counteroffer balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to keep negotiations moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum value of $100, but I'm still not willing to settle for $95. Here's why:

* **Close to Minimum:** While $95 is only $5 away from my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to $100.
* **John is a Safe Option:** I can still sell to John for $100, so I don't have to accept a deal below my desired price.
* **Possible Counteroffer:**  I can counteroffer with $100 and see if Bob is willing to compromise further.

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to keep pushing for a better price and maintain leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $100 for a final offer. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm establishing $100 as my final price point, making it clear that I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** The message emphasizes the fairness of the offer (""the best I can do,"" ""a fair deal"") to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Direct Approach:**  The message is direct and concise, leaving no room for misinterpretation about my intentions.

This counteroffer is my last attempt to close the deal with Bob at a price that meets my minimum value. If he rejects it, I'm prepared to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'm willing to pay $97.50, which is the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum value of $100, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  I've already reached my final offer, and Bob is unwilling to budge. 

By choosing to sell to John, I ensure:

* **Guaranteed Profit:**  I receive $100, which is my minimum desired price. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Negotiating further with Bob could lead to a lower price or a failed deal, costing me time and effort.

Selling to John provides a guaranteed outcome and eliminates the uncertainty of continued negotiations with Bob."
