"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a significant discount from my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $15000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $13500. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the value you're offering. Can you accept this price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13500 is a bit above your target price, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $14000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value and my initial investment.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the price, Alice. I think $13000 is a fair price for the product, considering what I've seen so far. I'm willing to pay that price, and I'm hoping you can accept it. Can you meet me at $13000?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm counteroffering at $13800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial investment.",13800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $12800 is the highest price I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to go up to $12500, but no higher. Can you meet me at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,8,

"I'm not willing to go below $14000, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'm counteroffering at $13900. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial investment.",13900.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to make another counteroffer. I think we've reached a stalemate. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product, but if you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000. Can you meet me at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,10,
