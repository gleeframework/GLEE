"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is under your $15,000 limit, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $8,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, and Alice might come back with a lower price. If not, you can always buy from John for $15,000, which is still within your budget."
