"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my target as possible. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product, considering its value to you is $800000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}"
