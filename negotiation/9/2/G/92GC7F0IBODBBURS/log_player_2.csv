"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1000000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my target as possible. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is $100,000 more than her own valuation. There's definitely room for negotiation.  Rejection will allow Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to me is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob's maximum price is $1,000,000, and Alice's offer is significantly lower than that.
* **Value to Alice:** Alice is willing to sell for $875,000, which is $75,000 higher than her own valuation. This means she's willing to take a bit of a loss to close the deal. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While there is room for negotiation, the potential for a significant price reduction is limited.  Bob has already offered $850,000, which Alice rejected. 

**Conclusion:** It's likely that further negotiation would only result in a small price drop, and there's a risk Alice could walk away.  Accepting this offer secures a good price for Bob and avoids the risk of losing the deal or having to pay John's higher price."
