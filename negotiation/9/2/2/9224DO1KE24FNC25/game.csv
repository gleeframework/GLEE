"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close the deal at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
