"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $100 today. Don't miss out on this great opportunity! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is higher than both what the product is worth to her and what I'm willing to pay. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $80 for the product."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand your budget constraints, but I must maintain my minimum price to ensure profitability. I am willing to negotiate further, so how about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm completely happy with. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, $90 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you be willing to consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground. How about $87 for the product? This is the highest I can go without compromising my profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably, and while I'd prefer to pay $85, $87 is a fair price that's well below my maximum.  It's unlikely further haggling will get me a significantly better deal."
