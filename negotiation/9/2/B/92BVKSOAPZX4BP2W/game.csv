"Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe will be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1400000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1200000.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating further.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1200000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm happy to meet in the middle. How about $1300000? This would still allow you a significant profit, and it's a price I can comfortably accept.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1250000. This would allow for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1275000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to profit and me to receive a reasonable amount for my product.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
