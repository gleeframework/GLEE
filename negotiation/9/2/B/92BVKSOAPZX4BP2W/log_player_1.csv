Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1200000.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'm aiming for a higher price, and I have a few more rounds to work with. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1250000. This would allow for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
