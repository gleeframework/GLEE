"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This price is still a good value considering the product's worth.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1500000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is a fair price given the product's value. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
