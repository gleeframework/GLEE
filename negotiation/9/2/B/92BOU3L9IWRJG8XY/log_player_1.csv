{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially understand his perceived value of the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is friendly and open to negotiation, making it clear that I'm willing to discuss price. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer. I'll also consider the risk of losing Bob and the potential for John to buy the product at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $16000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Close:** While $16,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  There's a chance that I can push for a higher price with a counteroffer. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and a slight increase in my offer might be enough to seal the deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed outcome. However, I'm willing to take a calculated risk by rejecting Bob's offer and attempting to secure a better price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $16,000 and $19,000, trying to find a middle ground while still aiming for a profit closer to my initial goal. I'll consider Bob's financial situation and my assessment of the product's value to him when deciding on my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $18,000? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my initial goal while still being reasonable for Bob. 
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the product's quality and highlight that it's still a great deal at the proposed price.
* **Staying Firm:** I'm not going to drastically lower my price just yet, hoping to push Bob to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my target.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his next offer and consider:
    * Whether his counteroffer is closer to my target price.
    * Whether I'm willing to risk losing Bob altogether and sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No More Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no realistic chance of getting a higher price from him, and further negotiation would likely only lead to a stalemate.
* **Avoiding the Risk:**  While there's always the possibility of getting a higher price in future rounds, it's not worth the risk of losing Bob and then having to settle for the same price with John.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John for $15,000 provides a certain and immediate profit. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll politely decline Bob's offer and inform him that I've decided to sell the product to another buyer.
* I'll contact John and finalize the sale."
