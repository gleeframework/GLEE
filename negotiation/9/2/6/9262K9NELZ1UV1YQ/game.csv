"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own a truly valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to me is at least $12000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $13500. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to me. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to go down to $13000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a great opportunity for you to own a truly unique product, and I think it's worth the investment. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11800 for the product. Can you consider that?",11800.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11800. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $12800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob, and I'm not sure how much more I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $12500. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your concession, but $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000.",11000.0,Bob,10,
