"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it gives me a good price as well. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $6,000 for it."", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500?  That would give you a good price and leave me some room to make a profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to John's price, I'm still aiming to get as close to my $6,000 offer as possible. There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a little steep.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 7250
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. $7,250 is closer, but I need to make sure I get a good price for this product. Let's split the difference - how about $7,875? It's a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $7,875 is only slightly above John's price of $8,000.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, and there's a risk Alice might not budge much further. It's a good deal considering the potential time and effort saved by not going with John."
