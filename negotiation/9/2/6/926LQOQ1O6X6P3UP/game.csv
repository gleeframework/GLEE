"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it gives me a good price as well. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500?  That would give you a good price and leave me some room to make a profit.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a little steep.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That feels like a fair deal to me.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. $7,250 is closer, but I need to make sure I get a good price for this product. Let's split the difference - how about $7,875? It's a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you say?",7875.0,Alice,5,
