"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $100 right now. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,135.0
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $150, which is $125. Would you be willing to go up to $125?",125.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $100.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider my other options.",100.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $100. I'm willing to meet you at $130, which is a bit above your last offer. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",130.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm really hoping we can find a way to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $115?",115.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,127.5
"I see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $130, which would be $122.50. Is that a price you'd be willing to consider?",122.5,Alice,7,,
