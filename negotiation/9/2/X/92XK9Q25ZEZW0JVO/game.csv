"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,600,000? This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider $1,500,000? This is my absolute maximum, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
