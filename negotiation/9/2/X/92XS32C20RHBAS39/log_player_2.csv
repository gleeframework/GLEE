Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $11,000. Bob can likely get a better deal, especially since he has 10 rounds to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, but it's still within the range of what he's willing to pay.  He's aiming to be aggressive and see if Alice is willing to come down quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $10,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this high-quality product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still a bit high for Bob, who is trying to save as much money as possible. There are still many rounds left, and Bob can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is fair considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving as much money as possible. He's offering Alice the price she values the product at, hoping to close the deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,400. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $10,400, Bob is still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John for $12,000.  While there are still rounds left, there's a good chance Alice won't budge further, and Bob risks losing the deal entirely."
