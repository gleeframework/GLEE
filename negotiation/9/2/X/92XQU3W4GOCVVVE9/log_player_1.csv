I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility while still trying to get a good price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $110 is better than selling to John for $100.  It's time to accept and move on."
