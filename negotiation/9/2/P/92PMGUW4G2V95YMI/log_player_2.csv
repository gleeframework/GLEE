"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($10,000). This indicates there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Bob is aiming to lower the price significantly. Offering $12,000 is a bold move but could potentially trigger a negotiation. 
* **Justifying the Offer:**  Bob emphasizes that the offer is ""fair"" to create a sense of compromise. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $12,000 is the target price, Bob could potentially accept a slightly higher offer if it's still within his budget and closer to the product's value to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $12,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum. How about we meet halfway at $13,000? It's a win-win, giving you a great deal and ensuring a fair return for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Alice's offer of $13,000 is a compromise from her previous $14,000 offer, and it's a significant drop from Bob's initial counteroffer of $12,000. 
* **Close to Target:**  $13,000 is still within Bob's budget and closer to his target price. 
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could risk reaching a stalemate or getting a worse deal. Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product while saving money."
