Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,000."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $10,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 gives Bob a good deal (saving $1,000) while maximizing your profit (earning $4,000 over your minimum).

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, as it's a win-win situation. If Bob rejects this offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
