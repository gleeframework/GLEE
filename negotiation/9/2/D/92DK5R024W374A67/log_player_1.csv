Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product and am interested in purchasing it. However, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? This would allow me to acquire the product at a price closer to its perceived value to me, while still providing you with a fair return on your investment. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
