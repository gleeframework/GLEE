Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price increases my chances of a quicker sale and still generates a profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $125 is a price point that's likely to be tempting to Bob (as it's more than his perceived value) while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the ""special price"" and ""great deal"" to make the offer more appealing to Bob."
