{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $14,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. It shows you're open to discussion while still aiming high.
* **Considering Bob's Valuation:**  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable or scarce.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always propose a lower price, gradually moving closer to her minimum acceptable price of $10,000."
