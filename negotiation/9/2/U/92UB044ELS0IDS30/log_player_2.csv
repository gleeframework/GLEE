Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $90? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, and I'm willing to try to meet you halfway again. How about we compromise at $85? It's still a bit above your original offer, but I'm willing to make a sacrifice to keep the deal going. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

While I could try to haggle Alice down another $5, there's no guarantee she'll go lower. Accepting the $85 offer ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with, even if it's slightly above John's price."
