"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to create a positive impression."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for less than what I need."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $100? That's still a good price for the product and gives us both some room to be happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's offer. I'm also reaffirming my willingness to negotiate and highlighting the benefits of the deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $92 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price and I think I can do better.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work. I'm going to drop my price to $98.  That's a big step for me, so I'm hoping you'll see it as a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 98} 
```

I'm taking a bigger step this time by dropping my price closer to Bob's offer. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting this is my final offer. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Let's see if we can get even closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation and while Bob is getting closer to my minimum, we're still too far apart.  I don't want to risk going through more rounds and ending up with a deal that's not worth it.  It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John."
