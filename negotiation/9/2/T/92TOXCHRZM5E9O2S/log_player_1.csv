Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm Alice and I have a unique product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1,900,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and prove to be a worthwhile investment.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's strategic to aim higher with Bob.  Starting at $1,900,000 gives you significant room for negotiation while still being within a potentially acceptable range for a product worth $1,500,000 to him. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, subtly justifying the high price.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open to discussion and hearing Bob's perspective, making it more likely he'll engage in a negotiation rather than immediately rejecting the offer. 

By starting high and engaging Bob in a positive manner, you increase your chances of securing a price significantly higher than your guaranteed sale price."
