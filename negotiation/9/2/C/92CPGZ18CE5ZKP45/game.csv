"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $10,000.  This reflects a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value to me is considerably higher. I could consider letting it go for $15,000.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $12,000, which is a more reasonable compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.",12000.0,Bob,4,
