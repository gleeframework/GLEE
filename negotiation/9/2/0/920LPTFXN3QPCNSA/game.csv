"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a real game-changer, and I believe it can be very valuable for your business. My initial price is $2,000,000.  This reflects the product's unique qualities and potential.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the initial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is certainly lower than my initial offer, it's not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000, but I'm confident this product will generate significant value for you.  Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can find common ground.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
