"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating at that price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,000,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This offer reflects a significant discount while still acknowledging the true worth of what I'm offering.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to my range, I can only offer $850,000. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to look at other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
