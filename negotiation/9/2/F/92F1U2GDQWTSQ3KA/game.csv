"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I was thinking more along the lines of $165. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to make a profit on this sale.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise, but I need at least $160 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",160.0,Alice,5,
