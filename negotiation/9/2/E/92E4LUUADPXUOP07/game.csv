"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1 million. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is still a great deal for you and a significant saving for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
