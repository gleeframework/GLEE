"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 feels fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than mine ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is designed to be polite but firm, gauging Bob's initial reaction and willingness to engage in a potentially high-value deal. 
* **Backup Plan (John):**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup option, ensuring I don't settle for anything less than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant profit, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask and closer to the middle ground between our valuations. I believe there's room for Bob to go higher, especially since he rejected my offer outright instead of countering with a smaller decrease. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is too low considering the value this product brings. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer aims for a compromise by suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between our previous offers. This demonstrates a willingness to move but holds firm on a price above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to reinforce its worth and justify the higher price point. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward, giving Bob a chance to reconsider and potentially offer a higher figure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer, but I believe there's still some wiggle room. While $1,100,000 is a good profit, I want to test his willingness to go higher. By rejecting this offer and countering again, I signal that I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be closer to $1,200,000 for a deal to make sense on my end. How about $1,175,000?  This seems like a fair price considering the value you're getting."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this round ($25,000 instead of $100,000) to show I'm getting closer to my limit while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value to Bob, I'm subtly anchoring the higher price in his mind.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will reveal if Bob is genuinely committed to the purchase and willing to meet me closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still interested.  Would you consider $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,125,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob explicitly stated he's ""close to his limit."" Pushing further risks losing the deal entirely. 
* **Time Value:**  We've negotiated well, and I'd rather secure a great price now than risk the deal falling through in later rounds. It's better to walk away with a strong win."
