"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is too low considering the value this product brings. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be closer to $1,200,000 for a deal to make sense on my end. How about $1,175,000?  This seems like a fair price considering the value you're getting.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
