"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $2,000,000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a high price of $2,000,000. This sets the tone for the negotiation and allows for some room to lower the price if needed.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  By using the phrase ""Let me know what you think,"" I'm acknowledging the possibility of a counteroffer and opening a dialogue.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Unknown Value:** I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product, so I'm aiming for a high initial price.
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,500,000, but I want to see if I can get more from Bob. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and try to maximize my profit while keeping the possibility of selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1700000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob has offered $1,700,000. This is significantly less than my initial asking price, but it's still above John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. Since I have 10 rounds, rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John would guarantee a profit, it's a less desirable outcome. I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to round 3 and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,700,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for something closer to my original offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This reflects the unique value of this product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm aiming to meet Bob halfway.  This demonstrates flexibility while still showing that I'm committed to getting a price closer to my original goal.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob about the ""unique value"" of the product to reinforce its worth.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and encourages further negotiation, while also setting clear expectations for a fair deal.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as a safety net.
* **Risk Assessment:**  I'm taking a calculated risk by not accepting Bob's offer. My goal is to find a price that maximizes my profit, but I'm prepared to walk away if Bob's final offer is too low.
* **Negotiation Dynamic:**  I'm aiming for a win-win scenario by finding a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1750000. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is closer to my desired price than his previous offer. 
* **Midpoint:** This offer is a reasonable midpoint between my last counteroffer of $1,850,000 and Bob's previous offer of $1,700,000.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds remaining, accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit of $250,000 above John's offer. 
* **Risk Assessment:** While I might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, continuing the negotiation is a risk. Bob might not budge further, and I might end up losing a sale and settling for John's offer.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most prudent decision at this stage. It secures a profitable sale while minimizing the risk of a stalemate or a worse outcome."
