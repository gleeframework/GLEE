"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product for $1,550,000. It's a unique asset that holds tremendous value for you, and I believe this price reflects its potential.  Let me know your thoughts.  If you decline, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is bluffing. She claims to have another buyer at $1,500,000 (her own product's value to her), but it's unlikely someone else would offer that much if you, a potential buyer, are already in negotiations. Rejecting her offer might lead her to propose a better price, or you can always buy from John at your desired maximum price."
