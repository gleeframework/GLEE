Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob, making it seem like a good deal for him. 
* **John as a backup:** I'm aware I can sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  A $1,000,000 sale would be a good outcome.
* **Open the door for negotiation:**  I'm signaling flexibility without being desperate.
* **Keep John's offer in mind:**  It serves as a safety net and allows me to set a higher starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:**  $900,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **I have a better option with John:**  I can sell to John for a higher price, making Bob's offer unattractive.
* **I can counteroffer:** Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and have a chance to negotiate a better price. Selling to John is always a possibility if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I can accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, reflecting the value of the product to you. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with a price of $950,000, which is higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my starting price. 
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value to Bob and making it clear this is my final offer.
* **Bridging the gap:** This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions and encourages Bob to accept. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not accepting his offer outright, as I still have the option to sell to John for a higher price. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  $950,000 is a decent outcome, closer to my desired value.
* **Increase the chances of a deal:**  A counteroffer shows willingness to compromise and makes it more likely that Bob will accept.
* **Limit further negotiations:**  Framing this as my final offer puts pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $920,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful:** Bob has consistently offered lower prices, and I've already made a concession. 
* **John offers a much higher price:** Selling to John guarantees me a significant profit, exceeding my minimum value and eliminating the need for further negotiation with Bob.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower price or a dead end is not worth the potential profit I can secure by selling to John."
