"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I'm hoping to gauge his initial interest and see if he's willing to play the negotiation game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is better than my minimum value, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but still allow me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is closer to my desired price than my minimum value.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer and me ending up with the $10,000 from John is too high.  I'll take the $13,500 and secure the sale."
