"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room for negotiation to try and get a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to her perceived value, there's still room for negotiation. Offering $10,500 is still a significant markup from her perspective. We can try pushing a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $9,750?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
``` 

This counteroffer splits the difference between the previous two offers, demonstrating willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit above $9,750. I can do $10,200. That's as low as I can go, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling this is her final offer and she's made a significant move from her initial price. Accepting $10,200 secures the product at a price well below your maximum and risks pushing Alice away if you counter again."
