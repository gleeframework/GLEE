"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems great, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but $7,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget. Although it's getting closer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He has a backup option with John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $8,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,250. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  He's already had several rounds of negotiation and is getting close to his limit.  While there's a possibility of getting a better price with more rounds, there's also a risk that Alice will stick to her price or the deal will fall apart. Given that John is willing to sell the product for $8,000, which is within Bob's budget, it makes sense for Bob to accept John's offer and secure the product."
