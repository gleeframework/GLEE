{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $1,100,000 is still too high for Bob's budget."

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a price close to Bob's maximum budget, leaving room for some potential compromise."

While $975,000 is tempting, it's still more than what Bob is willing to pay.  There's a chance Alice will come down further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While the price is tempting, it's important to remember that Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. It's worth one more round of negotiation to see if Alice will budge further.  There's a chance she's willing to come down closer to $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 960000}

This counteroffer is a compromise, slightly higher than Bob's previous offer but still lower than Alice's. It shows a willingness to meet halfway and could potentially lead to a deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

With only one round left, it's unlikely Alice will drop her price to a point where it's more beneficial for Bob than buying from John.  It's better to secure the product for a known and acceptable price rather than risk failing to reach an agreement with Alice."
