Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,225,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, and although it is closer, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John is offering a price that is within Bob's budget and guarantees a deal."
