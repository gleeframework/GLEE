"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,300,000 is slightly out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price given the potential savings for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're not willing to go as low as $1,150,000.
