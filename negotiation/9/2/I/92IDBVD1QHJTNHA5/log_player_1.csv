Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and more likely to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob to make him more interested.
* **Flexibility:** This initial offer leaves me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.

I'm also keeping in mind the value of my product ($120) and John's willingness to pay that price.  If Bob rejects my offer, I can always sell to John, which gives me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $120.  
* **I have a better option with John.**  I can immediately sell the product to John for $120, which is significantly better than Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation can continue.** While I'm not happy with Bob's initial offer, I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and proceed with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm not able to go that low at this time.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $90? This is still a great price for a product you'll find very valuable."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price of $90, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive and Persuasive Tone:** I'm using positive language to maintain a good rapport with Bob while also highlighting the value of the product.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm still leaving room for further negotiation, which is crucial in case Bob is still hesitant.
* **Balancing Value and Profit:** $90 is a fair compromise that allows me to earn more than Bob's initial offer but still potentially close the deal.

This counteroffer allows me to keep negotiating while still maintaining a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $120.
* **I have a guaranteed better option with John.**  I can immediately sell the product to John for $120, which is significantly better than Bob's offer.
* **The negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result.** Bob's counteroffers are consistently below my minimum price, and further negotiation is unlikely to change his mind significantly.

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this ensures I get the best possible deal and avoids further time-consuming negotiation."
