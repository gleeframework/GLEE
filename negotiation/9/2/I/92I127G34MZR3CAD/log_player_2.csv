"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $2,200,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high. It's above my budget and significantly more than what the product is worth to me.  I'll reject and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is too high for me.  Considering my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Counter:** My counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for potential concessions.
* **Fairness:** I've presented this counteroffer as a ""fair price that benefits both of us."" This emphasizes that I'm not just trying to get the lowest price but seeking a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Room for Negotiation:** $1,200,000 is still above my maximum budget, but it gives me room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above my budget and what I believe the product is worth.  I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further.  The fact that she called it her ""final offer"" is a bit of a negotiating tactic, but I'm not giving in yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer by a significant amount ($200,000), showing I'm serious about negotiating but not rushing to accept her price.
* **Fairness Argument:** I continue to emphasize a ""fair price"" and finding a ""middle ground."" This avoids sounding overly aggressive and keeps the negotiation friendly.
* **Budget Constraint:** I reiterate my budget limitations to remind Alice that I have a realistic ceiling.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end by suggesting we find a ""middle ground"" to show a willingness to continue negotiating."
