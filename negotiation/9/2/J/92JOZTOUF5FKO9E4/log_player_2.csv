"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer. He has room to negotiate because he's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's bottom line is $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he'd prefer a lower price, Alice's counteroffer of $11,250 is still within his budget and a better deal than buying from John for $12,000."
