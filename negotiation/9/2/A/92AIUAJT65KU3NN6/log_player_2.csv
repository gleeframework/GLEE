"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, you can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  You have a clear target price of $1,000,000, and you know Alice is motivated to sell. There's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm not sure $1,100,000 is within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $1,050,000. This price still allows you a significant gain and leaves me closer to my desired value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is only $50,000 more than your target price of $1,000,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance Alice might stick to her offer.  At this point, accepting her offer is a safe and reasonable choice, as you're getting a good price and avoiding further negotiation."
