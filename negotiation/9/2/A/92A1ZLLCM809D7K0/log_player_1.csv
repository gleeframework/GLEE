{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I am hoping to maximize my profit, but also acknowledging that Bob has a higher valuation for the product.  This opens the door for a potential counteroffer, which will give me more information about his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still far from my ideal price. I believe there's more room to negotiate with Bob.  I'll try to bridge the gap with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, $9,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,500? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, Bob's counteroffer of $9,800 is a significant improvement over his previous offer and is a better deal than selling to John.  It's time to secure the sale and move on."
