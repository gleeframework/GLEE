Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $19,000, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to start the negotiation higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $19,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing on a price higher than your minimum.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is designed to be polite but firm while gauging Bob's level of interest. His response will help you determine if you need to adjust your price during the negotiation.

**Important Note:**  While you have a fallback option with John, pushing Bob too hard with an unreasonable price might make him walk away entirely. This strategy aims to balance risk and potential reward."
