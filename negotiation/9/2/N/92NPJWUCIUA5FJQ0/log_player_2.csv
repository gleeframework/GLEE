"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $125.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $125 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We're starting with a strong counteroffer that's also Alice's valuation of the product. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $150 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $110?  That's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we still have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can get her closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

We're proposing a compromise that's still favorable to us while showing Alice we're willing to meet her halfway. This keeps the negotiation moving and increases the chances of a deal."
