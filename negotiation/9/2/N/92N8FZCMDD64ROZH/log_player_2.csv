{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $900,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and uniqueness of the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than your ideal price.  You can likely get it down further with a counteroffer.  The goal is to save as much money as possible, so it's worth continuing the negotiation."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go below $850000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $825000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is still above your ideal price of $800,000.  While you could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that Alice is unwilling to go lower.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $800,000, it makes sense to buy from him.  This ensures you get the product at your maximum price point and avoids further negotiation."
