Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation but below your minimum:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This helps keep the negotiation focused and efficient.
* **It includes a positive message:** This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider your offer. 

Keep in mind,  you can adjust the price and message based on Bob's response and how the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price, especially since you have John as a backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This counteroffer offers a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to negotiate but still want a fair price.
* **It's below your initial offer:** This shows flexibility and makes you seem more agreeable.
* **It includes a positive message:** This keeps the conversation friendly and encourages Bob to consider your offer. 

Remember, you can adjust the price and message based on Bob's reaction in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can only go up to $92. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $92 is close to your minimum price, it's still below the $120 you can get from John.  Selling to John guarantees the best outcome for you in this situation, ensuring you get your desired price and avoid further negotiations."
