"Hello Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. After careful consideration, we have decided to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a special opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at an attractive price.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you and my own financial constraints.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of this, we would like to counter with an offer of $900,000 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while providing you with a competitive price. We hope this proposal meets your expectations.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm happy to pay $875,000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you a comfortable profit and me staying within my budget.  What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We've carefully considered your proposal and would like to counter with $890,000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between our profit margins and your budget constraints. We believe this offer will be acceptable to both parties.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! While I appreciate your compromise, $890,000 is still a little outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $880,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allows for a successful transaction. Let's finalize this deal.",880000.0,Bob,6,
