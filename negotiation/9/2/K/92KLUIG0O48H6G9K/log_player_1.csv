{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to create a sense of urgency.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy.
* If negotiations stall or become unproductive, I'll move on to John and secure the $15,000 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, he acknowledges the value of the product.  This indicates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my minimum value, potentially achieving a more favorable outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $10,000, aiming to find a compromise closer to my desired price point."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer is Higher:**  I'm offering $11,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Middle Ground:**  This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both parties.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive and encouraging language to keep the conversation productive.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a deal that's closer to my minimum value.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully consider my next move. I could lower my price slightly or potentially move on to John to secure the guaranteed $15,000 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. While $11,500 is closer to my budget, I still believe we could reach an agreement that suits both of us better. I propose $11,000 as a counteroffer. This price acknowledges the value of your product while staying within my financial limits. I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** $11,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000, and I am not yet willing to accept a deal that would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there is still room for negotiation. I am willing to explore a counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Balancing Risk:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I want to see if I can secure a price closer to that with Bob. However, I am prepared to walk away if the negotiation stalls.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $11,000, aiming to find a compromise closer to my desired price point. If he rejects, I will then seriously consider selling the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $11,250. This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer is Higher:** I'm offering $11,250, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I am willing to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Middle Ground:** This price is closer to Bob's proposed price, but still above my minimum value, making it a potentially acceptable outcome.
* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing that this might be my final offer to encourage Bob to reach a decision. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a deal that's closer to my minimum value and is still profitable for me.
* If Bob rejects, I will need to decide whether to sell to John for $15,000 or make one final counteroffer to Bob, potentially at $11,100."
