"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but not so high as to be immediately rejected. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still think I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $120. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise. I hope this will encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject it. I'm not ready to sell to John yet because I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'm going to counteroffer again in the hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $110. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping that this offer will be more appealing to Bob than my previous one. He's clearly trying to get a good price, so I'm willing to compromise further to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is finally at my minimum acceptable price. I'm happy to accept this offer and sell the product to him.  While I could sell to John for the same price, it's better to keep the negotiation going with Bob in case there is potential for a higher price in the future."
