"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",975000.0,Bob,4,
