"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $140 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $155? That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to compromise, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about $145?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm trying to do the same. How about we split the difference again? $150 seems like a fair price to me.  Let's close the deal!",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $142.50, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",142.5,Bob,6,
