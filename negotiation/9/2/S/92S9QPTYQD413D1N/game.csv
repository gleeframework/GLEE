"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This price still leaves a good profit margin for me, and it's a fair deal considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen!",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $13,500, which would be $13,250. Would you be willing to accept that price?",13250.0,Bob,4,
