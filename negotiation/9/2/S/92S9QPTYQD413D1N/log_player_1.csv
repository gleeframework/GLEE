{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth so much to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is close to my ideal price but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob, making it seem like a good deal for him.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If the counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counter-counteroffer. However, I'll always be aware of John's offer of $10,000 as my fallback option.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my ideal price, but still above my minimum.** While $12,000 is a decent profit, I believe I can do better.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  Bob has shown interest in the product and is willing to negotiate. This indicates there's potential for a higher price.
* **Counter-offer strategy:**  I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us.

**My next counter-offer will be $13,500, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a comfortable profit margin.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This price still leaves a good profit margin for me, and it's a fair deal considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This shows that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize the fair deal and good profit margin for both of us, making it sound like a win-win situation. 
* **Urgency and finality:**  The message ends with ""Let's make this happen!"" to encourage a quick decision and potentially close the deal.

**This counteroffer represents a balanced approach between maximizing my profit and securing a deal with Bob. It also positions me to either accept Bob's potential counteroffer or proceed to John if necessary.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $13,500, which would be $13,250. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my ideal price:**  Bob's offer of $13,250 is very close to my desired price point of $13,500.
* **Risk of losing a good deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price or even a stalemate. Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, so this offer seems like a good deal.
* **Time and effort:**  Negotiating further could be time-consuming and ultimately not worth the potential gain of a few hundred dollars. 

**Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice, as it ensures a profitable sale with minimal risk.**"
