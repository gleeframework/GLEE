"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's potential value, I'm not comfortable with $800000 at this stage. To start, I'd like to offer $600000. This price reflects my initial assessment of the product's worth, and I'm open to further discussion based on your feedback.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $700000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique product. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to move closer to your offer. However, $700000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $650000, which represents a fair compromise considering both our desired price points. I'm confident that this price reflects the product's value while allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm offering it to you for $675000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique product. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
