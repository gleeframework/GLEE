Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```
