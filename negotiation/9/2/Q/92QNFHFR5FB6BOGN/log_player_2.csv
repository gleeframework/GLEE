Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

At this point, Alice has come down significantly, and further haggling might push her away from a deal. Accepting at $825,000 represents a good balance between saving money and securing the product."
