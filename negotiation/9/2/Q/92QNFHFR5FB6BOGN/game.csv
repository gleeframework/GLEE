"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,
