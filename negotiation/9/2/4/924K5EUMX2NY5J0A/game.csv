"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $90 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but would you be willing to come down to $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $82.50 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $80? That's a good compromise, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase.",80.0,Bob,4,
