Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll get closer to your desired profit margin.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's value, you're subtly justifying the higher price without explicitly stating it's worth more to Bob.
* **Time Pressure:**  By stating you'll list it publicly, you create a subtle sense of urgency, prompting Bob to decide faster.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, starting the negotiation process.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a fair opportunity to purchase a product he values."
