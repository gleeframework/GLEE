"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your business. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. I've done my research and believe a fair price for this product is closer to $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the price of $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product and the unique benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,800,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise while still recognizing the significant value this product brings.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to maximize your return, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it and allows us both to walk away happy. ",1500000.0,Bob,4,
