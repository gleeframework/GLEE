Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the price of $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product and the unique benefits it offers. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,800,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise while still recognizing the significant value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to maximize your return, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it and allows us both to walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 1500000}
