"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. I believe this price is still a fair reflection of its value, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1100000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. Let's meet in the middle at $1125000. This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to reach a fair outcome. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a middle ground, but $1115000 is unfortunately still too low for me.

This price is a small compromise from my previous offer, and it's a number I feel comfortable with.  What do you say?",1117500.0,Alice,7,
