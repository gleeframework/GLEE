"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly above my minimum but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate down. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not afraid to walk away if he's too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is more than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $100 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is a good price and closer to my desired amount, I'm still hoping to squeeze out a little more.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I'm willing to go down to $108. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to get a great deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $108 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $102? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $102 is a good deal and I'm running out of time. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
