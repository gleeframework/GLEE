At this point, Alice has come down considerably, and we're getting close to the halfway point between your initial offer and her initial asking price.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and you risk her accepting a better offer from someone else if you push too hard.  $910,000 is a reasonable price, saving you a significant amount compared to John's offer."
