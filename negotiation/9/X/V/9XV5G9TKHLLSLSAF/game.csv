"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $14000 might be a stretch, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, considering its true value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8000. It's the maximum I can afford for this product. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
