Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed offer from John, my goal is to get the highest price possible.  Offering it to Bob first gives me a chance to exceed John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Bob values the product at $800,000.  By offering it at $950,000, I'm:
    * Leaving room for negotiation.
    * Positioning the price as a premium, reflecting the product's value.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  I know if Bob rejects this offer, I have a secure fallback with John at $1,000,000."
