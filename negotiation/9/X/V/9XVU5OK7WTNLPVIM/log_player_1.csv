Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate. I'll be watching Bob's response closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is still a good deal for Bob since he values the product at $800,000. I'm hoping to strike a compromise and close the deal without needing to go through further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally met my minimum price. I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal. While I was hoping for a bit more, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I'm confident that I can find other opportunities in the future to potentially earn a higher price."
