"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
