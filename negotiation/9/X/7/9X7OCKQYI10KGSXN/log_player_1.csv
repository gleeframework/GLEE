Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's better to keep negotiating with Bob to try and get closer to my desired price. $1,350,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but it's a good starting point for the next round."

I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,400,000.  While $1,360,000 is tempting, I'm not ready to give up on a better deal. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."
