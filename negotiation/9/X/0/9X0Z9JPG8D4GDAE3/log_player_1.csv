Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,400,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer the product for slightly less and still make a substantial profit, aiming high initially allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Understanding Value:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so our offer sits comfortably below that, ensuring he recognizes the potential gain.
* **Alternative Option:**  It's important not to price ourselves out completely, as we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000. This knowledge allows us to be assertive in our initial ask."
