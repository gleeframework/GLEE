Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. 
* **Potential Profit for Bob:**  Bob could make a profit of $300,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000) if he buys at your minimum.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of that potential $300,000 profit for yourself, knowing you have John as a safety net. However, being too greedy could make Bob walk away.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a potential $100,000 profit, which is still a significant incentive for him.
* **Confident Language:** The message avoids sounding desperate and emphasizes the product's value.
* **No Mention of John:**  You don't want to reveal your backup plan unless Bob explicitly rejects your initial offer.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You can then decide if you want to come down slightly or hold firm at $1,400,000."
