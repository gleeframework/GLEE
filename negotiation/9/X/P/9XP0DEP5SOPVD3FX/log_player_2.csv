"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Alice's value ($1,400,000 vs. $1,200,000).** This means Alice is willing to make a profit.
* **You can get the product for a lower price from John ($1,500,000).**  While this is your upper limit, it's still better than Alice's offer. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you have the opportunity to potentially negotiate a lower price with John or find an even better deal elsewhere."
