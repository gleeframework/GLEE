"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my desired price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $800,000, I still believe there's room for negotiation with Bob. I'm confident that I can get a higher price than his initial counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. It's a reasonable compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on the value of the product."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not yet ready to settle for that amount. I believe there's still a possibility to negotiate a higher price, and I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 875000}

I'm making another slight concession by lowering my price to $875,000.

This is a good compromise point, and I'm confident that Bob will find it more appealing than his previous counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's only $10,000 lower than my last offer, I'm confident that I can still squeeze out a bit more from Bob.  We're close to a deal, and I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 865000} 
```

I'm making a small counteroffer, just $5,000 higher than Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to meet him halfway, but I'm still not willing to go lower than that. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful that Bob will accept it."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

With only 3 rounds left, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's the highest price he's offered and is closer to my desired value than selling to John.  There's always the chance Bob will counteroffer higher in the next round, but I'm taking the risk of settling now to secure a decent profit."
