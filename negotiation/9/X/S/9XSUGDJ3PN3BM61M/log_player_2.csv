"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's still a lot of room for negotiation, and you have multiple rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Given my budget, I'd be happy to offer $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range. It shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not going to accept an unreasonable price. I'm aiming to start the negotiation at a price that's closer to my budget, and hope to reach a compromise in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not that low. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $11,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm close to my target price, but I'd prefer to see if I can push for a lower price.  I'm going to make another counteroffer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground with Alice. $10,500 is a reasonable compromise that's closer to my budget, but still acknowledges the value of the product. By proposing a specific price and highlighting the fairness of the deal, I'm hoping to make it more attractive for Alice to accept."
