{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120.  It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $150 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer allows for a good profit margin for you, while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider, given his perceived value of the product.  It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than $80 from John, it's still below your minimum desired price of $80. You can likely get closer to your target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $110?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $95? That's my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $95 is still below your initial desired price, it's higher than what John is offering and is a good compromise. It also ensures that you avoid potentially further lowering the price if you reject and counteroffer again.  Bob has also stated that he's unwilling to go lower, which suggests accepting his offer might be the best course of action."
