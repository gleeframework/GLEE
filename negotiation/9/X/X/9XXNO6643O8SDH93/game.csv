"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $112. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"I understand that $108 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115. This is my final offer. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's close this deal. ",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $112, Bob. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're willing to meet me at $112, I'm willing to sell it to you. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",112.0,Alice,7,
