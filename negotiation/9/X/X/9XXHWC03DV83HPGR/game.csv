"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product but I'm only able to go up to $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I'm still a bit short of my desired profit. I'm going to throw in a sweetener - I'll include a one-year warranty on the product, which is a $50,000 value. So, my revised offer is $950,000 for the product, plus the warranty. This is my final offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,,
