Alice's offer is still higher than my budget. While it is a step in the right direction, I will try to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I'm still a bit short of my desired profit. I'm going to throw in a sweetener - I'll include a one-year warranty on the product, which is a $50,000 value. So, my revised offer is $950,000 for the product, plus the warranty. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Alice's offer is tempting with the added warranty, it's still above my budget. I'm confident that I can get the product from John for a lower price and still be within my budget."
