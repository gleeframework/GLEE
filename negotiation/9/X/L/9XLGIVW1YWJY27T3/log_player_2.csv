Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal for me. What do you think?

While $12,500 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
