"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit high, but $5,000 is quite low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $7,000 is getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
