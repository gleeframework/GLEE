Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it is:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** Bob is only willing to pay $800,000, so I am starting with a price that gives him room to negotiate. 
* **Lower than my minimum acceptable price:** I need to get at least $1,200,000, so I have room to negotiate downwards if necessary.

By starting with a higher price, I can attempt to get closer to my ideal price while still keeping the negotiation open. I can always lower my price if necessary, but it's important to start strong."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I believe I can get closer to my goal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not giving away too much. I believe Bob is more likely to accept this offer than the previous one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob is proving to be a tough negotiator, and I'm not confident I can get much higher than his current offer of $900,000.  This is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John, who is guaranteed to pay my minimum price."
