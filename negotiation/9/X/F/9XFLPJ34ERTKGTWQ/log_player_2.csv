"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product for a price of $18,000. I think it's a great value considering its worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price and even above her own valuation of the product. It makes no sense to negotiate with her when you have a guaranteed option with John for $8,000."
