"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm willing to let it go for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a better price than John's $100, you can potentially get it for even cheaper. You know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $95 to $90, which is closer to your desired price point.  While you might be able to get it down further, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price is too high. Accepting the offer at $90 is a good compromise and allows you to buy the product for less than John's price."
