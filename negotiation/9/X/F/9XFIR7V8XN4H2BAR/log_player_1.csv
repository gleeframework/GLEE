"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm aiming for a good profit, but also want to see if Bob is genuinely interested.  If he rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is a decent amount, I'm holding out for a higher price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that by meeting him halfway, I can entice him to agree to a price that's closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm not desperate yet. I'm hoping to squeeze out just a bit more profit in the remaining rounds. If his next offer doesn't improve significantly, I'll be more open to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,450,000. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but I'm hoping it shows him that I'm serious about getting a better price. We're getting close to the halfway point in negotiations, and I need to start closing the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can get a little bit more. It's risky, but with only four rounds left, I'm hoping Bob will be willing to budge a bit more. If his next offer is similar, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,350,000.  This is a significant concession, and I'm hoping it will encourage Bob to come back with a better offer.  However, I'm getting close to my minimum, and if Bob rejects this, I'll likely accept John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer is now my minimum. However, I'm not confident that I can get him to increase his offer in the next round. To avoid the risk of ending up with my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
