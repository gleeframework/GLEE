"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price. He should counteroffer in the next round to see if he can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his target price, he can still get the product from John for a lower price. He should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However,  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,015,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice is coming down in price, she's still asking more than what Bob can get from John.  At this point, it's not clear that Alice is willing to go any lower, and Bob doesn't want to risk more rounds of negotiations.  He can get the product for a lower price from John, so it's the best choice at this time."
