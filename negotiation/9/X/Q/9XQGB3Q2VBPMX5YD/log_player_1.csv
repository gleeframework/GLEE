Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:** Offering a price too close to your minimum ($10,000) would leave money on the table.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob while maximizing profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
