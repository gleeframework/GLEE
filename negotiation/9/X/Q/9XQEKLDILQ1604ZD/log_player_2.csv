"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still worth exploring if you can get a better deal.  There's no harm in seeing if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This might seem high, but it's a good starting point to see how flexible Alice is on price. If she rejects this, we'll adjust our counteroffer accordingly in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly from her initial offer, but we're still within range of getting a better price.  There's no reason to accept yet, as we've already demonstrated our willingness to negotiate and have a few more rounds to try and get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're slowly closing the gap. I'm increasing my offer by $5, showing good faith while still pushing for a price closer to my target. If Alice accepts, we win. If she rejects, we'll continue to inch closer to her price in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is a decent price and within my budget. I'm happy to accept this offer and save $40 compared to buying from John.  While I could try to get a lower price, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal and having to buy at John's higher price."
