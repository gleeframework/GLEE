# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, we would like to counter your offer with a price of $900,000. This price still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while acknowledging the value the product holds for you. We hope this aligns better with your expectations and look forward to your feedback.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. After reviewing our costs and potential market conditions, we are willing to consider a price of $875,000 for the product. This allows us to maintain a satisfactory profit margin while acknowledging your valuation of the product. We believe this offer strikes a good balance between our interests and yours. Please let us know if this proposal is acceptable.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000. This is still above my ideal price of $850,000, but it's a significant improvement. 

* **Further negotiation:**  There is a chance I could get her down to $850,000, but it's risky. It could lead to further rejections, delaying the purchase.
* **Buying from John:** The risk of further negotiation is higher than the potential savings. John's price of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than Alice's current offer.

Therefore, it's better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a good price, rather than risking a protracted negotiation or a higher cost from John."
