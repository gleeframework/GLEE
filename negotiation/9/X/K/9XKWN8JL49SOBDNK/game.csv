"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and your profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, we would like to counter your offer with a price of $900,000. This price still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while acknowledging the value the product holds for you. We hope this aligns better with your expectations and look forward to your feedback.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000.  This price is fair to both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's try to find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,4,
