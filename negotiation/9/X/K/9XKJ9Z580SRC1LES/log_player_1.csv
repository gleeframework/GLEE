"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to capture a significant portion of the potential value Bob might see in the product.  It's a bold move, but I'm confident in the product's worth. We'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$600,000 is far too low. While I need to be careful about the number of rounds, I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,200,000. This is a significant concession, but it keeps the negotiation moving forward.  I'm hoping this price is appealing enough to Bob, while still allowing me to get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I need to make a decision soon, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm dropping the price again to $1,000,000. This is my bottom line.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John. I've already given Bob significant concessions and I'm confident I can get this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time. While I'm hoping for a better price, Bob's offers are still too low. It's time to secure the deal with John and guarantee a sale at $1,000,000."
