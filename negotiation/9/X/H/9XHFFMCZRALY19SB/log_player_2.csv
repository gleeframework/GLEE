Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. How about $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still higher than her value of the product ($80).  This shows I'm serious about negotiating but also leaves some room for a compromise."

Round 3
Alice's offer:

While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still higher than my target price. I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit higher than what I'm looking to spend.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? "", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to continue to nudge the price down while leaving room for compromise.  $87.50 is a fair midpoint between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and hopefully encourages Alice to make a final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground here. Considering your feedback, I'm proposing a price of $89 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it will work well for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $89 is very close to my desired price point.  At this point, I'm confident that I won't get a better deal through further negotiation, and it's worth accepting this offer to avoid the risk of losing the deal."
