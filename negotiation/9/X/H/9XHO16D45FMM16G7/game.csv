"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some flexibility. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original prices.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $775,000 is still a bit below what I can realistically accept.  Let's try $800,000 - this is a fair price, given the value of the product. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with.",800000.0,Alice,5,
