You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

You can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. You have room to negotiate since you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 and Alice is willing to sell for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation if she rejects it."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still within your budget and represents a good deal.  You are saving $250,000 compared to buying from John.  While you might be able to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and you having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential for further savings."
