Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but also leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, I believe he is likely to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough to make a good profit. I'm confident I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also leaves room for a small profit margin.  I believe Bob will be more likely to accept this offer, as it's closer to his desired price."
