"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to part with it for.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering the value we both see in this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. How about $1,100,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to part with it for.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
