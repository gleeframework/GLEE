Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I won't accept it. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is still a good price for me, and it's closer to my initial offer, showing some flexibility. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price to $160. This shows I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise that Bob will accept."
