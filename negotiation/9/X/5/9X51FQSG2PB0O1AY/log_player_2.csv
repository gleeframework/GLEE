"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still quite high. Since I'm aiming to save as much as possible, I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $750,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is better than her initial offer, but it's still too high for me. I'm willing to continue negotiating and try to get the price down further."
