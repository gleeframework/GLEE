Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's something I believe you'll find very valuable. My starting price is $950,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $750000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold, and I want to see if I can secure a higher price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $750,000 is below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $875000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm prepared to offer $825000.  This is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
This is a good deal for me. I'm getting $25,000 more than what John would pay, and it's just above my minimum threshold. It's worth securing the deal with Bob, as it reduces my risk of missing out on a higher price."
