Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By stating I'm open to negotiation, I show flexibility and encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Building Interest:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential fit for Bob to make the offer more appealing. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget while still leaving room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the details you've provided. Given my budget constraints, I am proposing an offer of $8000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting his offer guarantees me the minimum profit I'm comfortable with. While there's always the possibility of a higher offer, it's not guaranteed.  There's also a risk of further negotiation with Bob, which could lead to a lower price or a protracted negotiation process.  By accepting his offer, I secure the deal quickly and avoid potential complications."
