"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll be willing to pay a premium for it. My initial offer is $25000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is far above your budget.  It makes sense to reject and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the exclusivity you mentioned, $25,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, and I'm thinking more along the lines of $22000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and exclusivity. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $22,000 is still above your budget.  It's better to continue negotiating and see if you can get a better deal.  You can use John's offer as a benchmark to see if it's even worth pursuing this negotiation further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see your point about the value and exclusivity of the product, $22,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15,000, but I'm not comfortable going any higher. Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15000 is a better offer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $19000. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still higher than your budget, but it's getting closer.  You can continue to negotiate, using John's offer as a benchmark to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still not comfortable going above $15,000. This is my final offer. I'm confident that a good deal can be reached at this price, as it's fair to both of us. Let me know if you're open to it."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to accept $15000. I've already compromised with my previous offer of $19000, and I'm not comfortable going any lower than that. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm thinking of meeting you at $18000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $18,000 is still above your budget, and you've already stated that $15,000 is your final offer.  With only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely that Alice will come down to your price. Since John is offering the product for $12,000, it's a better deal to purchase from him."
