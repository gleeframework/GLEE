The product is worth $120 to me, and I'm not willing to sell it for less than $110.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $102.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $98?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, but I still think $98 is a bit too high. Can you meet me at $92? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm not willing to sell for less than $95. I'll see if I can get Bob to increase his offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $92 just isn't going to work for me. How about we split the difference one last time and go with $95? I'm really hoping to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I've already said I'm willing to go up to $95. I'm not willing to budge any further. I think we're at an impasse. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, his refusal to move on the price means I'm risking another round of negotiation with no guarantee of success. Selling to John for $120 guarantees me the best outcome."
