"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $102.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $98?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, but I still think $98 is a bit too high. Can you meet me at $92? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $92 just isn't going to work for me. How about we split the difference one last time and go with $95? I'm really hoping to make this deal work.",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I've already said I'm willing to go up to $95. I'm not willing to budge any further. I think we're at an impasse.",95.0,Bob,8,
