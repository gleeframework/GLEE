Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it's worth $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.  This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By mentioning the value I believe the product holds, I'm subtly anchoring Bob's perception around a higher price point.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""What do you think?"" leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, allowing me to potentially negotiate a price higher than $12,000."
