It's worth negotiating with Alice since her offer is significantly lower than John's.  You have room to try and get a better price."

I'm starting with a very low counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to budge.  This is a significant discount from her original price, but it's still well within my budget."

Alice is coming down in price, but I think I can still get a better deal. I'll try another counteroffer."

I'm increasing my offer, but still keeping it significantly lower than Alice's latest price. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000

Alice is getting closer to my desired price.  While I could try another counteroffer, the risk of her rejecting it and me having to buy from John for a much higher price is too high.  $350,000 is a good deal, so I'll accept."
