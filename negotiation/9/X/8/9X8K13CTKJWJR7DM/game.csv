"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $100? I'm really interested in the product and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,
