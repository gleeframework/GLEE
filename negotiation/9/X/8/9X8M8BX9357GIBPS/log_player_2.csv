"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to get a profit, $900,000 is still significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $300,000."
