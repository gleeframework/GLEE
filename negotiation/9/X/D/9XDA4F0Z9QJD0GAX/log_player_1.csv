{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $115, you're:

* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for the highest price Bob is likely to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's a small chance Bob might try to haggle, and you can always come down slightly. 
* **Staying Above Your Minimum:**  Even if you need to negotiate down a little, you're still ensuring a profit above your John backup."
