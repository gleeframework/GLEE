Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed offer from John, my goal is to get the highest price possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so I need to offer a price that's appealing but leaves room for profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, I might adjust my price slightly. However, I won't go below $1,200,000 as I have John's guaranteed offer."
