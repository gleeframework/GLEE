"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth more to Alice than me, so she will likely be willing to negotiate.  I will reject her offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is more than I'm comfortable paying.  Given my own valuation of the product, I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant and goes beyond $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is still asking for too much. I am confident I can negotiate a better price.  I'll reject her offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I can only offer $950,000 at this time. This is a strong price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a successful transaction. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
