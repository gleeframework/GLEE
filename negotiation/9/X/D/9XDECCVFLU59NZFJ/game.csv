"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is more than I'm comfortable paying.  Given my own valuation of the product, I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant and goes beyond $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I can only offer $950,000 at this time. This is a strong price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a successful transaction. Let's find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
