"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for some flexibility. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm confident the product's value justifies a price closer to $800,000. How about $825,000?  It's a compromise that allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
