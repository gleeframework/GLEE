"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This takes into account your budget and still allows me to get a reasonable return on my product. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario. Let's make this happen!",1100000.0,Alice,3,
