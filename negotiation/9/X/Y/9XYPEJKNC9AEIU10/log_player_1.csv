"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **High initial offer:**  Starting with a high offer sets the tone for a potentially lucrative negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my minimum price, indicating I'm open to negotiation while still aiming for a profitable sale. 
* **Assessing Bob's interest:**  This offer will reveal how much Bob values the product and whether he's seriously interested in making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's low offer:** $1,000,000 is my minimum, and I believe the product is worth more. Accepting would be settling for the bare minimum.
* **Room for improvement:**  I still have 9 rounds, and it's likely Bob will increase his offer, especially given his initial interest in the product.
* **Testing Bob's limits:** Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate and willing to negotiate. It'll force Bob to consider increasing his offer if he truly wants the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:**  This offer is significantly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's. This shows I'm willing to compromise but not giving in entirely.
* **Testing the waters:**  This allows me to gauge how flexible Bob is and if he's willing to increase his offer further.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's initial offer, I'm demonstrating I'm not desperate to sell and have a high valuation of the product. This keeps the negotiation in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Significant increase:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a significant jump from his previous offer, showing his willingness to negotiate.
* **Time is money:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, we're already halfway through the negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing a potential sale by being too inflexible.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though I'm accepting this offer, it establishes a good relationship with Bob, which could lead to future business opportunities."
