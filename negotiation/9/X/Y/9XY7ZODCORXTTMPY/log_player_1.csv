Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, it's always best to try and get the highest price possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  I need to offer a price that is appealing to him but still significantly above his valuation.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price between $1,350,000 and $1,500,000.
* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, framing it as a desirable opportunity for Bob."
