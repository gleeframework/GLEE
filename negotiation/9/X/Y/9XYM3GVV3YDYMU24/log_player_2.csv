"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product to you. I'm thinking of a price of $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you're willing to pay. It makes the most sense to go with John's offer of $100."
