"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100.  Let me know if you're open to that.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  I'm still a bit high at $140.  How about $120? It's a good compromise, and it's the most I can afford.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $120 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to $140. How about $135? It's a good middle ground, and I think it's fair for both of us. Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $135 is still a bit high for me. How about $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a deal. Let me know if you're open to it.",125.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a little on your offer. However, $125 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $130.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and would allow us to close this transaction. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit high at $130.  I'm willing to go to $127, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",127.0,Bob,8,
