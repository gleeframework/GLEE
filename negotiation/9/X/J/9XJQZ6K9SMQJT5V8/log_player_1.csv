"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000 but still leaves some room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his estimated value of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still far from the value I'd prefer. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500, which is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer. This should demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to stick to my goal of trying to get closer to $10,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm going to try to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm going to offer $9,250.  This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still within the range of what I'm willing to accept. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."
