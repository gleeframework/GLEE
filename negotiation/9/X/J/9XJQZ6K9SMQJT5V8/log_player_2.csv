"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get the product for even less by negotiating with Alice. It's worth exploring the possibility of a lower price before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a bold counteroffer of $8,500. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and closer to Bob's maximum budget. This move aims to establish a lower starting point for negotiation and gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob is still within his budget, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower to close the deal. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price point, but still wants to save some money. A counteroffer of $9,000 shows a willingness to compromise while also leaving room for potential negotiation in the future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,250 is a good compromise. It's within Bob's budget and significantly lower than Alice's initial asking price. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk Alice might become less willing to compromise and Bob might end up losing the deal altogether.  At this point, accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price while also avoiding the risk of losing the opportunity."
