Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) without losing him to a lower offer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still keeping Alice well above her alternative sale price.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message aims to convey the product's value and exclusivity without being overly aggressive or scaring Bob away with a price too close to his maximum.

By offering the product at $1,100,000, Alice has a strong chance of maximizing her profit while still ensuring a sale."
