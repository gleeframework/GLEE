Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $120. I think you'll find it's a real steal at this price!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) and your minimum ($100) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The $120 offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he counteroffers, you know he's interested but looking for a lower price.
* **John as Backup:** You always have the option to walk away and sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the interest, but I am only able to pay up to $80 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is too low. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $100, so accepting $80 would be a loss. It's worth countering and seeing if you can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget, but $80 is quite low for the value this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Hold Firm:** You're now at your minimum acceptable price ($100). 
* **Justify the Price:**  You're not simply accepting or rejecting, you're providing a reason for your counteroffer, highlighting the product's value. 
* **Pressure Point:** Bob now knows you have a backup offer (even though he doesn't know the exact amount). This might encourage him to accept if $100 is within his reach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your understanding of my budget constraints. However, I am still unable to meet at $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is less than your initial target, it's still a $10 profit over selling to John. Bob is unlikely to go higher, and there's no guarantee you can negotiate a better price in further rounds. It's best to accept the $90 and secure the profit."
