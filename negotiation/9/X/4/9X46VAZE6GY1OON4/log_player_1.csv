Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $170, knowing the product is worth $120 to Bob. This gives him room to counter, but it's a strong opening position.  I'm also considering that I can always sell to John for $150 if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price.  While $140 is more than my minimum, it's still less than what I'd get from John.  I'll counteroffer and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm counteroffering at $155.  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum and closer to what I'd get from John.  I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum value of $150. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, it's better to sell to him and secure a better price."
