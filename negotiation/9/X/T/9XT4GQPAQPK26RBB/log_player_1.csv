Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You want at least $80, so $100 gives you some wiggle room.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $120, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  Bob knows what you're offering and what he needs to do next. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than $80, you can likely do better. Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows you to try and get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer! I'm willing to come down a bit to $95, but that's really the lowest I can go.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're acknowledging Bob's offer and demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Stays above your minimum:**  $95 is still above your minimum desired price of $80. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  This gives Bob a chance to counter again if he wants, potentially leading to a win-win situation."
