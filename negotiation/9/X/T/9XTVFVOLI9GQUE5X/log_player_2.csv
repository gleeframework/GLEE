"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.

* **Rejecting the offer allows for counteroffers.** This gives Bob the opportunity to try and get a better price."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I believe the product's value to you is significantly higher than that, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $950,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to offer $825,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1,000,000. I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $975,000. This is my final offer for this round.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's come down some, $975,000 is still a significant amount more than Bob's initial counteroffer. 
* **Time is running out.** There are only 5 rounds left before Bob has to resort to buying from John.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for counteroffers.** Bob needs to try and get Alice closer to his price range before he has to consider John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $975,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to offer $875,000. This shows I'm serious about making a deal and it's a price that's fair to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement this round."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 7

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's closer to Bob's desired price, but still leaves a substantial margin for negotiation. 
* **Time is becoming critical.** There are only 3 rounds left before Bob has to consider buying from John.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is out.** This is the last round of negotiation with Alice. 
* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's a small decrease from her previous offer, and Bob is likely to get a better price from John.
* **Buying from John is the best option.**  While John's price is higher, it's a guaranteed purchase and saves Bob from further negotiation that could potentially lead to a worse outcome."
