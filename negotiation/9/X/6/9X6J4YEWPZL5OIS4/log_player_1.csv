"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find really valuable. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts by building rapport with Bob and then sets a price that's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a decent offer, it's still below the middle ground between our values.  Rejecting allows for further negotiation and the possibility of reaching a price closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

This counteroffer acknowledges Bob's offer while still holding firm on a price closer to my desired value. It also uses language that suggests a willingness to compromise, further encouraging a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $105 is only $5 away from my counteroffer and just a bit above my minimum desired price.  There's a good chance we won't get a better offer, and accepting now is a good way to avoid risking more rounds and potentially getting a lower offer."
