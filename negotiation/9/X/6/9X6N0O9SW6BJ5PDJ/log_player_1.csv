{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be very interested in.  It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit margin. It also shows I'm willing to compromise, which might encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price that works for both of us, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,750 is still a good deal for me.  It's more than what I'd get from John, and we're both closer to a compromise."
