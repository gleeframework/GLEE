"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product has incredible potential for your company. I'm offering it to you at $1,200,000. This price reflects its value while giving you a significant opportunity to profit.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a high offer ($1,200,000) that is still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Emphasizing the product's potential for Bob's company helps him understand why the price is justified.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer gives me space to negotiate and potentially reach a price that's mutually beneficial.

**Important Notes:**

* I'm keeping the offer high enough to make it worth my while, but also low enough to be attractive to Bob.
* I'm setting a clear expectation of negotiating, making it clear I'm open to discussing the price.
* I'm also reminding Bob of the value of the product to help justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my company's budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than my desired price, but it's still within a reasonable range considering his perceived value of the product.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe I can still negotiate a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:** While $800,000 is my minimum,  I'm not yet desperate enough to sell to John. 

**Next Steps:** 

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, giving him room to negotiate while still securing a good deal for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,000,000 is attractive, I'm still looking for a price closer to the value I initially proposed.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000.  This price reflects the product's potential and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer Strategy:**  I'm proposing a counteroffer that is $100,000 higher than Bob's offer, which is a compromise while still allowing me to make a substantial profit. 
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a way to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Maintain Negotiation Momentum:** This keeps the negotiations moving forward and prevents the situation from stalling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'm counteroffering $1,050,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 lower than my previous counteroffer, bringing us closer to a mutually acceptable price.
* **Time is of the Essence:**  We're already four rounds in, and with each round, the risk of John's offer becoming more tempting increases.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  While I'd ideally like a higher price, I'm willing to accept this offer to secure the deal with Bob. This could lead to future opportunities to sell similar products to him in the future.

**Decision:**  I'm accepting Bob's offer, as it's a good compromise that allows me to achieve a substantial profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
