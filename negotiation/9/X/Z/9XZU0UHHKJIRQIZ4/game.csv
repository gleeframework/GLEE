"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I understand you have a budget in mind. Could you consider $17,000? This offer reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for working with me.  While I appreciate the adjusted price, I still think it's a bit high. Could you do $11,000? I think that's a fair price and would allow me to close the deal today.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me as well. I'm motivated to sell this product, but I need a price that makes sense for me too.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This would be my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming back to me. I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can do $11,500, and I think that's more than fair. Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Bob,6,
