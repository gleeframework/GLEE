Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a much higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high,  it implies that the value to Bob is significant, suggesting the price is justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts"" signals that you're open to discussing the price and potentially negotiating. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still acknowledging Bob's interest in the product."
