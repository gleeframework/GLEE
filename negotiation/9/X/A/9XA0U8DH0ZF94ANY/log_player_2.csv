Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, but that's as low as I can go. This product is worth a lot to me, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable selling it for less than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower.  Taking the $820,000 is the best outcome versus risking her walking away or running out of rounds and having to pay John $1,000,000."
