"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. How about we try $825,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for this incredible product.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems we're getting closer.  I can do $800,000, but that's my limit.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, but that's as low as I can go. This product is worth a lot to me, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable selling it for less than that. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,7,
