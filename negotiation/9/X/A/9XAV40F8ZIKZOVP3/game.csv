"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $85?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
