"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in your product and I'm prepared to pay $14,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $14000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16500.  This is still a great price for a product that's worth $15000 to you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $16,500 is lower than her initial price, it is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his target of $15,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500, which is a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 15500}
