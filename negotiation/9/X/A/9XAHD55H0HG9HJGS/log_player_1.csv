Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in your product and I'm prepared to pay $14000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. I believe the product is worth more than $14,000, and I'm willing to keep negotiating with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $14,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  This is still a great price for a product that's worth $15,000 to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15500, which is a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's slightly lower than my initial goal, it's still a good deal considering the value of the product to Bob.  It's also important to remember that I have limited rounds to close this deal."
