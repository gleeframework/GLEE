"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. This product is highly sought after, and $20,000 is a fair reflection of its value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $13,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the product's value, $17,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",15000.0,Bob,4,
