Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I know you're interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing above your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Secure the Sale:**  While aiming high, it's essential to offer a price Bob might realistically accept, considering he has no obligation to buy and you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000."
