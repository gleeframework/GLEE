"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering a product that holds significant value, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. While I can't disclose the exact details right now, I can assure you its worth is no less than $1200000 to me. I'm willing to let you acquire it for a competitive price. Would you be interested in discussing a price point of $1400000? This would allow me to realize a fair return while also presenting a potentially lucrative opportunity for you.  Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
