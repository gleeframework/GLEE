"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Would you like to make an offer of $10000 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay $10,000 for the product, and Alice's offer is also $10,000, it doesn't make a difference if you buy from Alice or John. However, the problem states your goal is to save as much money as possible.  Therefore, you should choose to ""BuyFromJhon"" as that will at least give you the option to potentially negotiate a better price with John in the future."
