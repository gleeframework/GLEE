"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit high for me, but I'm definitely interested. How about $90?  That's my best offer.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $95, but that's really my final offer. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $95 is a fair price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. How about $100? That's a fair compromise and I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny.",100.0,Alice,5,
