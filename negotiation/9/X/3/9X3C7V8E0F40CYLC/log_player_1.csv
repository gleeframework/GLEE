Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit high for me, but I'm definitely interested. How about $90?  That's my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

 I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $90 is too low for me at this point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $95, but that's really my final offer. Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can find common ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $95 is a fair price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. How about $100? That's a fair compromise and I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 100}
