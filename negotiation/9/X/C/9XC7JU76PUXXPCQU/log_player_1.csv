{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:**  This gives him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation without risking you selling below your minimum.
* **It's a round number:** This makes it easier for Bob to respond.

By starting with a higher price and being open to negotiation, you increase your chances of getting closer to your desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500 for the product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still lower than my ideal price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential deal, $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,750. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've reviewed my budget and am willing to go up to $9,600 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, Bob's offer is only $100 below my counteroffer, and I'm getting closer to my desired price. It's a good compromise and a fair deal for both of us.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
