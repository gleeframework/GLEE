Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's ambitious:** It leaves room for negotiation, ensuring we get a good price if Bob is truly interested.
* **It's justified:** We're confident in the product's value, so the price reflects that.
* **It's open-ended:** The message invites Bob to engage in the conversation, allowing us to gauge his interest and potential counteroffer. 

We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response, but for now, this is a solid first offer."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below our initial asking price and less than what we believe the product is worth.  We have 8 rounds left, and there's still potential for a better deal with Bob. We'll make a counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering the unique value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $1,250,000, which is only $50,000 away from our initial counteroffer.  We've got 6 rounds left, and while we could try for a bit more, it's unlikely we'll get much higher.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and minimizes the risk of losing a sale altogether."
