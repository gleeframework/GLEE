"Alice, your initial price is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I understand the value of this product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's unfortunately far below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin.  I believe this is a fair compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1700000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1000000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to me and allows you a reasonable profit. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart on price, but I'm confident we can find common ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1550000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and your potential gains. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1550000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product.  I believe this reflects the product's value to me and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

Let's try to reach a deal that benefits both of us.  If we can't come to an agreement in the next couple of rounds, I will have to consider selling the product to another buyer.",1400000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and your need to sell it quickly. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
