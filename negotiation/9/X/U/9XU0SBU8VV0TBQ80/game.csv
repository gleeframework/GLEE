"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1100000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and I think we can both be happy with this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that we're getting close to the sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but I need to make a profit. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and I think we can both be happy with this deal. I'm also keeping in mind that I have another interested buyer, so I need to make a decision soon.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
