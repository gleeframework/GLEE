Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  While I have a standing offer for $1,500,000, I believe you could greatly benefit from it.  I'm open to discussing a price that recognizes the value it holds for you. Would you be willing to consider an offer in the range of $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Not Too High:** I'm starting with a price ($1,300,000) that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also important that it's lower than John's offer to show some flexibility. 
* **Justification and Openness:**  I'm not just throwing out a number. I'm highlighting that I have another offer, reinforcing the product's value. However, I'm also expressing that I value Bob as a potential buyer and am open to finding a mutually beneficial price.
* **Encouraging a Counter-Offer:** By mentioning a ""range,"" I'm subtly inviting Bob to counter-propose. This keeps the negotiation open and allows me to gauge his true interest level. 

**Overall Strategy:**

The goal is to find a sweet spot where Bob feels like he's getting a good deal (even if it's above his initial valuation) while I still maximize my profit beyond the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
