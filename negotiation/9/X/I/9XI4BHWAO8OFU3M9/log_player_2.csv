# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You should accept Alice's offer. While you can potentially get a better price by rejecting and counteroffering again, it's not worth the risk. You're already within your budget and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept your next counteroffer. It's a good deal, and you should go for it."
