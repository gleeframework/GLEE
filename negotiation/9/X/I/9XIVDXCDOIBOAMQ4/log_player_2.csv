"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's really valuable to me. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great price considering its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $125? This would still give you a great deal, and it would allow me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Even though Alice's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, I can still try to negotiate a better price. I'm close enough to my walk-away point that I can afford to see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $120. That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to my maximum price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John, as they both offer the same price now."
