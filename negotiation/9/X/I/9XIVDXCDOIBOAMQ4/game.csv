"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's really valuable to me. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great price considering its worth. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $125? This would still give you a great deal, and it would allow me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $120. That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's make a deal!",120.0,Alice,5,
