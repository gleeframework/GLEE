"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, higher than my minimum value but not excessively high. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm countering with $98. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping to close the deal in this round, but I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $80 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $93 is getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can negotiate a slightly better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, keeping in mind that selling to John is always an option if I don't get a satisfactory offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 96}
```

I'm countering with $96. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept, but if not, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $80.  Bob's offer of $92 is getting closer to my minimum, but the negotiations are taking longer than I anticipated. I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a lower price or a failure to close the deal within the 10 rounds. Selling to John guarantees me a sale and a price that meets my minimum requirements."
