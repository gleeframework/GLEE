"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This still leaves you a healthy profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective valuations.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm still looking to get a good profit from the sale. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves me with a significant profit.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $850,000, and I'm willing to offer $860,000. This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to close this deal.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $880,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $870,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a significant profit.",870000.0,Alice,5,
