"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you based on your needs and preferences. Given its exceptional value and quality, I am extending this opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $12,000. This offer is tailored to ensure you receive the best possible deal while maximizing the return for us. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to proceed with this exclusive offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than John's price of $15,000, it's still significantly higher than your maximum valuation of the product ($15,000) and Alice's own valuation ($8,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. 

By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that the price is too high. She may be willing to lower it to make a sale, especially since you have the option to buy from John."
