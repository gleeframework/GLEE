"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product. 

This approach aims to start the negotiation strong, giving me the best chance of securing a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I want to close the deal, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $150, which is my absolute minimum. This reflects that I'm serious about selling but still trying to get a good deal.
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but maintaining my position. I'm focusing on the value of the product to make my price seem reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  I'm not desperate to sell and John is a reliable buyer offering $150, which is my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my price in the next round, but I'm ready to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $130 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $140, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested at that price, I have another buyer who's ready to purchase it for $150."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price to $140, which is a slight compromise. 
* **Message:** I'm letting Bob know that this is my final offer, increasing the urgency for him to accept. I'm also reminding him that I have an alternative buyer, making it clear that I'm not desperate for a sale.

This strategy aims to push Bob towards acceptance while still maintaining a favorable price for myself.  If he rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John for $150, which is my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to pay $140, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  We've gone through several rounds, and it's clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my price. I've already stated that I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay my minimum price.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob, so I'll sell the product to John and ensure I get my minimum profit."
