"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate, even if it's just to see if Alice is willing to budge.  Since you're willing to pay $150, there's no harm in trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $150 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $125?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $135. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
 
Alice has come down to $135, which is within your budget.  Since you're comfortable paying up to $150, accepting this offer is a good deal."
