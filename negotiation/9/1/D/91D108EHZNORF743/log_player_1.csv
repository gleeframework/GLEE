Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to you, the message subtly implies it's significant by mentioning ""its value.""
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning you'll list it publicly (or that you have other interested buyers like John) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes you have no prior information about Bob's negotiation style. If you knew he was particularly price-sensitive, a different approach might be necessary. 
* **Relationship Building:** While aiming for the highest price is important, consider the potential for a long-term relationship with Bob. If this is a one-time transaction, pushing harder might be acceptable."
