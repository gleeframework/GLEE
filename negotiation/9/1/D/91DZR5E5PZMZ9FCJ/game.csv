"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. It's a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value and your budget. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm happy to pay $10000, which is the maximum I can afford. If you're willing to accept that price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $10000, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
