Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than you do. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is above my minimum threshold of $800,000 and represents a good compromise. I'll accept his offer to secure the sale."
