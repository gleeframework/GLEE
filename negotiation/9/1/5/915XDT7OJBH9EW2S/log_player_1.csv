Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:**  A positive and friendly message makes Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Open ended:** The question ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $125 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is $80.  Would you be willing to go lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, he has expressed interest in the product. This means there's potential for a mutually beneficial deal.  
* **Negotiation is the best strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired value. Selling to John at $150 is a guaranteed outcome, but I might be able to get more from Bob through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget.  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving towards Bob's offer, but not all the way.  This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while protecting my interests.
* **Highlight value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value helps justify the price.
* **Open ended:** The question ""Let me know what you think"" encourages Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit above my budget.  How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm ready to buy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $90 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **High chance of acceptance:**  Bob has shown a strong willingness to buy and is now very close to my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'd have to settle for selling to John at $150.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and is a good compromise."
