Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, securing a deal with Bob at a higher price is preferable. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $950,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning another interested party (John) introduces a sense of competition and encourages Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy aims to initiate negotiations from a position of strength. If Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice can gradually lower the price (within reason) before accepting John's offer as a last resort."
