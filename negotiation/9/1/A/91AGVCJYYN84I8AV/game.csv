"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000.  This is a fair price, considering the value I place on this product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial offer.  How about $800000?  This reflects a fair value for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get closer to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $815000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",815000.0,Alice,5,
