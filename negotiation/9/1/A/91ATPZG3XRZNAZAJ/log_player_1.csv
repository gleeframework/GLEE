Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to potentially come down a bit if needed. However, I'm confident I can get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value since I have a backup buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $10,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my initial offer. It's still within my acceptable range, and hopefully, it will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, allowing us to reach an agreement without going through further rounds of negotiation."
