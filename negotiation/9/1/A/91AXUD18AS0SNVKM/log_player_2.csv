"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up for $8,000, but I'd rather work with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While you value the product at $10,000, Alice's offer of $9,500 saves you $500 compared to buying from John. 
* **Negotiation is not possible:** The scenario doesn't provide for negotiation. You only have the options of accepting or rejecting Alice's offer."
