"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it'll be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is significantly lower than what I need to accept. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $9,500 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $10,250? This gives you a great price and ensures I can continue doing business.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $10,250 is still a bit too high. I'd be willing to pay $9,750 for it.",9750.0,Bob,6,
