Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it'll be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer of $9,000 because it's below my minimum value of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further to see if we can reach a price that's fair for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is significantly lower than what I need to accept. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not willing to accept Bob's offer, even though it's slightly higher than his previous one.  I want to try to get closer to my desired price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $9,500 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $10,250? This gives you a great price and ensures I can continue doing business."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $10,250 is still a bit too high. I'd be willing to pay $9,750 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob, it's clear he's not going to budge much further. With only 4 rounds left, it's not worth the risk of not closing a deal. Selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed profit and ensures I don't lose out on any potential income."
