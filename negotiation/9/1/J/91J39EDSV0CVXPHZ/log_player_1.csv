Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1150000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,075,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle too quickly. I'm hoping to push for a price closer to $1,100,000."
