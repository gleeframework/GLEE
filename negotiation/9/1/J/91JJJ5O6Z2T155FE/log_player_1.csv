"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation with a strong price, leaving room for potential concessions but still aiming to maximize profit. It also positions me with a good starting point for a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. It's worth exploring further negotiation rounds to see if I can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a profit that is more than John's offer. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
