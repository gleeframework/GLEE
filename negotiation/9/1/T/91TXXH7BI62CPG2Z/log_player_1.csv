{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, without going below my minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Time Value:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even if it means a slightly lower price. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob while considering the guaranteed sale to John."
