Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $15,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  He should counteroffer Alice to see if he can get a better price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still get the product from John for $15,000. It makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. At this point, Alice's offer is still too high compared to John's offer. There's a risk that continuing the negotiation with Alice could lead to even higher prices. It's better to secure the product at a lower price from John."
