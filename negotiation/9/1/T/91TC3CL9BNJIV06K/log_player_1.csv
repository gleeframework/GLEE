"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get closer to my desired value.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation, as I expect Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a higher price and potentially reach a mutually acceptable agreement. 
* **Risk of Selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees me $12,000, I'm not convinced that Bob won't come up in his offer if I reject this one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,250?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some breathing room."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Value:** I'm trying to maintain as much of my desired value as possible, while still remaining open to a deal.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language and highlighting the benefits for both of us to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me. How about $9,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob is closer to my desired price, there's still potential for me to push for a slightly higher price.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees me $12,000,  I'm still hopeful that I can close a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about $9,100? It's only $100 more than your offer, but it helps me reach a reasonable price.  I'm confident you'll agree it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 9100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm offering a very small increase from Bob's offer to show that I'm willing to meet him halfway. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob while still pushing for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language to maintain a friendly and constructive negotiation tone."
