"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,250?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some breathing room.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me. How about $9,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about $9,100? It's only $100 more than your offer, but it helps me reach a reasonable price.  I'm confident you'll agree it's still a great deal for you.",9100.0,Alice,5,
