"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's  higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to accept.  I'm also highlighting the benefit to Bob in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal with Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $11,000 for this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I respect the value of your product. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $10,500. This still leaves some room for negotiation, while also being closer to what I am willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want to achieve. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. But $10,500 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  This gives you a good deal and me a fair price. "", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise between your original offer and my maximum willingness to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close enough to my desired price point that I'm willing to accept it.  It's a good compromise, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.  While I could potentially get a higher price by continuing, there's also a chance Bob will walk away or I'll need to sell to John at a lower price than I want."
