"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($20,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language like ""fantastic product"" to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation by saying ""Let me know what you think."" 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum value of $15,000 as possible. I'll be prepared to counter Bob's offers, but I will also be aware of the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. There's a good chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Strategy:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value, but still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This would still give you a great deal on this amazing product.  Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is reasonable:** I'm coming down from my initial price, but still significantly above Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate but also holding my ground.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's ""amazing"" value to encourage him to consider the counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation positive and encouraging to keep Bob engaged. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum while leaving room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $14,000 is below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **There's potential for a better deal:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, there's still room for negotiation. It's possible I can get a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for further negotiation. I'm also considering the option of selling to John, but I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $14,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15,500?  I'm confident you'll agree that this is a great price for this fantastic product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows I'm serious about making a deal but also that I won't settle for less than my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm again emphasizing the ""fantastic product"" to remind Bob of its worth.
* **Positive and persuasive:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going.

**Strategy:**

I'm getting closer to my minimum value but still have room to negotiate in the next few rounds. I'm also considering selling to John, but I want to see if Bob will accept this final compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $13000, which is my absolute final offer.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $13,000 is below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is unlikely to improve significantly:** Bob has stated this is his ""absolute final offer,"" so further negotiations are unlikely to lead to a higher price.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and I'm running out of time.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get more than $15,000, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob and ending up with nothing is too high. Selling to John secures my minimum and guarantees a sale."
