{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $165 is still too high.  You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and Alice isn't budging much. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $80. This is the best deal available to you, and you'll save more money than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
