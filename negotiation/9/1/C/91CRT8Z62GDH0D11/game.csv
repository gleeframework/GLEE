"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product has value, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm still quite a ways away from that number, though.  Would you consider $9,300? ",9300.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're serious about the product and I appreciate that.  $9,300 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming a bit higher. Would you be willing to do $9,800? I believe this is a fair compromise.",9800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  I could possibly stretch my budget to $9,500.  That's really the limit for me though.",9500.0,Bob,6,
