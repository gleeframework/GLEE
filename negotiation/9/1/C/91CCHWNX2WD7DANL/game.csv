"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll find very interesting. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to come down to $12000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $12000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $14000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14000, but I'm still a little hesitant at that price.  How about $13500?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13500. I'm willing to meet you at $14250, which is closer to my target price. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",14250.0,Alice,5,
