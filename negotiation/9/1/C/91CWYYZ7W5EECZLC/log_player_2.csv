"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is a good starting point, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower. I want to see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $750,000 for this product.  I believe this is still a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer that's still well within my budget. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will encourage her to come down on her asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $825,000 is still too high. I'm going to counter again, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $750,000. Let's compromise at $800,000. This price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my initial offer of $750,000 but offering a slight increase to $800,000.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a good deal. This also puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or come down a bit further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $815000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $815,000, which is within my budget and relatively close to my target price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or stick to her price. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product and still save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
