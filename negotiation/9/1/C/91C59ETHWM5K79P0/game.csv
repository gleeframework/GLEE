"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be thrilled with your purchase.",200.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $200 and $150, which would be $175. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested!",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $175 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $160, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to consider that price?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $175 and $140, which would be $157.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if you're interested!",157.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $157.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $157.50 and $140, which would be $148.75. I'm hoping we can meet at this price, but I'm still keeping my eyes on John's offer of $80",148.75,Bob,6,
