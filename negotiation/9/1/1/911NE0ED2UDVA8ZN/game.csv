"I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $105.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $120? That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",120.0,Bob,4,
