"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my target price as possible. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $950000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $900000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
