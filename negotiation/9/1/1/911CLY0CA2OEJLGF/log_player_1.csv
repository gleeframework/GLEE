Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on a product I think you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. However, I'm open to discussing this further.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed and creates the perception of value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By stating you are ""open to discussing this further,"" you signal to Bob that you're willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** Saying ""you'll find valuable"" subtly emphasizes that the product is worth considering, even at the initial high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims to maximize profit but risks Bob immediately rejecting the offer. 
* You need to be prepared to negotiate down, potentially closer to his perceived value of $8,000, to avoid losing the sale to John (your guaranteed $10,000)."
