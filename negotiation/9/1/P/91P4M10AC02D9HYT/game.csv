"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $90. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle on $75? That feels like a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than I'd like, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $95. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us!",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $85? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'll offer you the product for $100. It's my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us!",100.0,Alice,7,
