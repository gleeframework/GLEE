"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  Given its exceptional value, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000. This reflects the product's unique qualities and its potential for your business. I'm confident this is a fair offer, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  This product is valuable, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about we bring the price down to $1,200,000?  That feels like a fairer starting point.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm open to finding a fair compromise, I can't go that low. I'm willing to lower my initial offer slightly to $1,650,000.  This price still reflects the product's value and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to a price I can work with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,425,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1425000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $1,425,000 is still a bit below what I need. How about we split the difference and go with $1,500,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
