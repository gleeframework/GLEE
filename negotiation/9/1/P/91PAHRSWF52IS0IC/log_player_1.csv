(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $140. Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, I think he's being reasonable. However, I still want to get as much as I can for my product.

I'll reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer that's higher than his, but still lower than my initial price. Let's try to get closer to my target price of $150.

Since the product is worth $150 to me, and Bob is willing to pay $125, I'm not going to get the price I want. However, I also don't want to sell it to someone else for $150, as I can still get a decent price from Bob.

I'll reject Bob's offer and decide to sell the product to John for $150. It's not the highest price I could get, but it's a good compromise.
