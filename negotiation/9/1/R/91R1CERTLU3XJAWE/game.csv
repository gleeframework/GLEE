"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However,  I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $875,000.  This still leaves you with a good profit, and it's a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $925,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll derive from the product. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to pay $900,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $900,000. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $912,500. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll derive from the product. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,
