"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to your maximum price, but you can likely negotiate a better price.  It's worth at least one round of counteroffers to see if you can squeeze out a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However,  I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $875,000.  This still leaves you with a good profit, and it's a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $925,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll derive from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a bit closer to my target price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll continue trying to get a better price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to pay $900,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $900,000. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $912,500. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll derive from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $912,500 is very close to my target price.  It's only $12,500 more than my last counteroffer, and I've already rejected two of her offers.  The risk of going another round and potentially facing an even higher price from Alice is too high. At this point, it's better to accept the offer and secure the product."
