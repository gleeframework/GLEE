"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob is a common negotiation tactic. This gives room for bargaining. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the value of the product (""amazing product"", ""worth a lot to me"") can help make the initial offer seem more appealing. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and open tone sets a good foundation for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose an offer of $140 for the product. I hope this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum.**  While $140 is closer to my minimum of $150, it's still below my floor.
* **Room for negotiation.**  I still have several rounds to negotiate. Rejecting the offer gives me leverage to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John is a safety net.**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $140 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $160. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Fairness:** ""Splitting the difference"" is a common negotiation tactic that can make the offer seem fair.
* **Open to negotiation:** Ending with ""What do you think?"" keeps the door open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose an offer of $150 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 meets my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Further Upside:** There's no guarantee I can get a higher price in the remaining rounds.  
* **John's Offer:**  While John is willing to pay $150, there's no added benefit to selling to him over Bob at this point."
