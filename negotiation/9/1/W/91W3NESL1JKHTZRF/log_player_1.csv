"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. I'm starting with a price of $120, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I want to signal to Bob that I'm willing to compromise, encouraging him to counteroffer.
* **Enthusiasm:**  Adding a positive message shows that I'm interested in selling to Bob, which could make him more likely to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$90 is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Opportunity to Counter:** I have the opportunity to counter with a higher price, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a backup:** I can always sell to John for $100 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in selling this to you, and I think this price is fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($100) and Bob's offer ($90).
* **Still Above Minimum:**  I'm keeping the price above my minimum, but I'm showing flexibility. 
* **Emphasizing Value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value can make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $97.50.  I'm serious about buying this, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite there:**  Bob's offer of $97.50 is very close to my minimum, but I'm still determined to get at least $100.
* **Counter-offer is still possible:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to counter again and potentially reach a price closer to my goal.
* **John is always an option:** I can still sell to John for $100 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $97.50 is very close, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $102.50.  This is a fair price that allows me to reach my target while ensuring you get a great deal on this product."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle Again:** I'm again proposing a compromise price, splitting the difference between my previous counteroffer ($105) and Bob's latest offer ($97.50). 
* **Minimizing Loss:** This counteroffer is just $2.50 above my minimum acceptable price, minimizing potential loss if Bob rejects it.
* **Reiteration of Value:** I emphasize that the price still represents a good value for Bob."
