Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can't agree to $11,500. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose $10,000. Let me know if this is within your range.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 for this.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with $10,800.  I'll try to get him to come up a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, I can't go lower than $11,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's settle this now."", ""product_price"": 11200}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and I respect your valuation of the product. I'd like to propose $11,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $11,000 is a good compromise and it's getting late in the negotiations.  It's better to secure a deal now than risk losing out and having to sell to John for a lower price."
