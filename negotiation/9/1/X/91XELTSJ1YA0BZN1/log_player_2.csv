"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $130. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $130 is significantly more than you want to spend and more than you need to pay.
* **You have a fallback option:** John offers the product for $150. While not ideal, it's a guaranteed maximum price if you can't negotiate a better deal with Alice.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to:

* **Negotiate a lower price:** Alice might be willing to come down to a price closer to her $80 valuation. 
* **Force a better offer:**  Knowing you have other options might make Alice more competitive."
