"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum value ($120). This allows for negotiation room.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value and usefulness to Bob, hoping to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm interested in purchasing the product for $90. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Counteroffer Opportunity:** By rejecting, I can send a counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about $95? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer but not going all the way to my ideal price. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price point.
* **Win-Win Focus:**  I'm emphasizing the potential for both of us to be satisfied with the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. I am willing to pay $92 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price ($120), it's still a bit too low.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting, I maintain leverage and can potentially push for a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Although selling to John for $120 is tempting, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. How about $94?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm raising the price by only $2, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better price.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm framing this as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see the value in closing the deal.
* **Urgency:** I'm hinting at closing the deal to incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. I am willing to pay $93 for the product. I hope this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $93 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're already in Round 6, and with only four rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement increases.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I'd prefer $94, accepting Bob's offer leaves room for further negotiation with other potential buyers if I sell to John later. 

**Overall, accepting Bob's offer balances the need for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal and the possibility of finding a better deal in the future.**"
