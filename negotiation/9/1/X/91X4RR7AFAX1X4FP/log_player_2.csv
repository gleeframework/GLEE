"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($120)** is within your budget of $150. 
* Buying from Alice saves you $30 compared to buying from John. 
* While you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, the potential savings are not worth the risk of losing the deal."
