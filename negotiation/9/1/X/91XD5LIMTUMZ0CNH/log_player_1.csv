Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I believe I can get a better deal if I counter."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, $132.50 is still above my minimum price and it seems like Bob is firm on his offer. I don't want to risk losing the deal completely and having to sell to John for less."
