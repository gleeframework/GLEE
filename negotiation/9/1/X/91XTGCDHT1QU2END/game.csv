"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair profit for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. This would allow you a significant profit and give me a good deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $890,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",890000.0,Alice,5,
