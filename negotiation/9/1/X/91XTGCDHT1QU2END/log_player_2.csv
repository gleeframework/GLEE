"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $950,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still a significant amount. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** There's room to negotiate a lower price.  
* **Buying from John is a backup:**  You have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, so you're not under pressure to accept Alice's first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair profit for you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still high:**  $900,000 is closer to your target, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** There's still a gap between Alice's price and your desired price.
* **John remains a viable option:** You can still buy from John for $1,000,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. This would allow you a significant profit and give me a good deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $890,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer:** $890,000 is only $40,000 away from your ideal price.
* **Limited time:** This is Round 5, and you have limited rounds left. 
* **John's offer is higher:** While you can buy from John for $1,000,000, Alice's offer is significantly better. 

While you might be able to negotiate a bit lower, the risk of losing the deal altogether and having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
