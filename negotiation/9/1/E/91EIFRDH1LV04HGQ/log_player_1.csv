Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to be optimistic but also prepared to adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a bit high, but I'm still interested in the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum acceptable amount.  The risk of further negotiation leading to a lower offer or a rejection from Bob isn't worth it, especially with John's offer as a safety net. I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
