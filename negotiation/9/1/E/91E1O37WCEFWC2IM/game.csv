"I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to be within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for your company. I'm proposing a price of $900,000, which still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's keep the conversation going.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still need to be careful with my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $820,000 is the highest I can go.",820000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand you have budget constraints,  $820,000 is still below the value I need to achieve.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $875,000. This price allows us both to secure a profitable deal.  What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $790,000 is the highest I can go.",790000.0,Bob,6,
