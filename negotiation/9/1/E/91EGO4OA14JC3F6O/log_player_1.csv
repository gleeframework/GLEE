I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give up too much value in the first few rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would have preferred to get closer to $95, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John. $92 is a good price, and I'm happy to close the deal."
