"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to make a special offer to you. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a one-time deal, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to match this price again. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we try $900,000? It's a compromise that I think will benefit both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I think this product could be very valuable, $900,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to do $870,000? I think that's a very fair offer.",870000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $880,000. I think this product is worth every penny of that price, and I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $875,000? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,5,
