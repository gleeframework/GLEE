"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, but I'm not sure I want to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1050000. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
