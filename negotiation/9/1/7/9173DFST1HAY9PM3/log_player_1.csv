"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,150,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still getting me closer to my minimum goal of $1,000,000. I'm confident that Bob, who values the product at $1,200,000, will see this as a good deal and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with $1,000,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still gets me closer to my goal of $1,000,000.  I believe Bob will see this as a fair price and be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $980,000 is getting too low.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of getting stuck in a stalemate and losing more time.  I'm going to take John's offer of $1,000,000, which meets my minimum goal and ensures a quick and sure sale."
