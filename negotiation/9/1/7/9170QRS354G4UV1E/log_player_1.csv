Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further but won't settle for such a low price. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,400,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product. I'm proposing $1,600,000. This reflects the product's quality and potential benefits to you, while still allowing for a reasonable profit for me."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far off from $1,600,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,450,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair.  I'm going to hold out for a better price.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,550,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,550,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,475,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and while Bob has shown interest, his offers are still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate may lead to further delays and potentially a lower final price. Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to him to ensure a guaranteed sale at my desired price point."
