"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a great opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's the first round and Alice's offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation.  I'll reject and propose a lower counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for it."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to move. There's a chance she'll accept, and even if she rejects, it sets a lower anchor for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,000. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has moved a little but is holding firm at $8,000.  While this is her actual value, I think there's still room to negotiate, especially since I have John as a backup option. I'll reject and try to inch my way closer to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $7,250? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7250
}
```

I'm incrementally increasing my offer, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but not giving up too much ground. I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable with $7,250, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $8,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice went up in price, which is a bad sign. It seems like she's trying to see if I'll budge upwards. I'll hold firm and make another counter-offer, but I'm getting closer to considering John's offer if this doesn't improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm a bit disappointed. Your offer went up instead of down. To be fair, I can go as high as $7,500, but that's my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

I'm expressing my disappointment at her price increase while also setting a firm limit. This signals that I'm serious about buying but not willing to be pushed around. I'm hoping she'll be more agreeable this round, but I'm prepared to walk away if necessary."
