Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm setting the price slightly below what I'd ideally like to get from John, but still above Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I earn a decent profit. I'm also adding a friendly message to make Bob more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $145 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand it's lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $135? It's still a great deal for you, and closer to what I need to make this work.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm also reiterating the benefits of the product to make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $135 is still a little high for me.  I'm really hoping to get it for $130.  Let's meet in the middle - what do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it still falls short of my goal. With Bob refusing to budge on his offer, and the alternative of selling to John for $150, I'm going to take the safe option and sell to John. I've already spent several rounds trying to negotiate with Bob, and further negotiation may not yield a better outcome. It's better to secure the guaranteed profit from John and avoid the risk of further rejection."
