"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in that.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $10,750 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,875.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider.",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but that's my absolute limit. I hope you'll see this as a fair offer and accept it.",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $10,800 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle once again at $10,850. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider.",10850.0,Alice,7,
