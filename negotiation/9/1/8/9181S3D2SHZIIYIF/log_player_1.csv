{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. It's important to leave room for negotiation, but I want to see how much value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get closer to $10,000. I'm going to try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm offering $9,800. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a significant amount and closer to my desired $10,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle yet. There are still more rounds and I believe I can push for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
```

I'm offering $9,600.  This is a further compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9,800. I think Bob is getting closer to my target, and I'm willing to concede a little more to get a deal done."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're down to the 6th round, and while I'd love to push for a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting $9,000 is still a good profit for me."
