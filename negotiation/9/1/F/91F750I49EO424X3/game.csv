"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, as the product is worth $800,000 to you. Let's try to find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's close to your value for the product and within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
