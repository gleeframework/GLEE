Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has signaled this is her final offer.  While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a real risk she won't budge, and I'd end up having to buy from John for $15,000. Accepting the $10,000 offer secures a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of overpaying."
