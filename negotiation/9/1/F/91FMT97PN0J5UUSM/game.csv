"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. This product is only worth $12,000 to me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $11,000? That's a significant move on my part.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I can do $11,500, but that's really my limit.  It's a fair offer considering John is offering me the same product for $12,000.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're getting close to your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as high as $11,500. I'm willing to compromise and offer $12,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,7,
