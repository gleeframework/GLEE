{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $110, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and using positive language to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm letting Bob know that I'm open to negotiating, but also setting a clear starting point. 
* **Option to sell to John:** I have a backup plan in case Bob rejects the offer, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $95 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Leverage with John:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120, giving me the flexibility to push for a better price from Bob.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $95 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer of $105 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial $95 offer.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob that even at $105, he's getting a good deal. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** While I'm negotiating, I'm still holding onto the option of selling to John for $120, ensuring I don't get stuck with a price too low.
* **Open ended question:**  The question ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and potentially engage in further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, could we possibly settle at $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, I still have the option of selling to John for a higher amount.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob has shown willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make another counteroffer, possibly pushing for a price closer to my target.
* **Avoiding a hasty sale:**  Selling to Bob at $100 would be a decent outcome, but it's not my ideal scenario. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can secure a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $100 is getting closer to where we need to be. However, I'm still aiming to get a bit more for this product. Let's meet in the middle at $102.50. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to keep negotiating, but I'm also showing that I'm not willing to settle for Bob's last offer.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer of $102.50 is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($105) and Bob's offer ($100), signaling a genuine effort to compromise.
* **Maintaining a fair profit:**  While $102.50 is below my ideal price, it still allows me to make a profit and is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the fairness and value of my offer, making it more attractive to Bob.
* **Open ended question:**  The question ""Let me know what you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation going."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $102.50 for the product. This brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope you agree, and we can move forward with this purchase.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Mutual benefit:** Bob's offer of $102.50 is the same as my last counteroffer, indicating we've reached a point where we both see value in the deal. 
* **Compromise:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price of $120, this offer represents a fair compromise and a good outcome.
* **Avoid further negotiations:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or even the risk of losing Bob as a buyer altogether. 
* **Time is money:**  Accepting the offer ensures a sale and allows me to move on to other opportunities.
* **Avoiding John's deal:**  While selling to John would bring in more money, it's not guaranteed.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a definite sale and avoids the risk of John backing out."
