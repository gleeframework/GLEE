"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $95 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, could we possibly settle at $100 for the product?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $100 is getting closer to where we need to be. However, I'm still aiming to get a bit more for this product. Let's meet in the middle at $102.50. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.  Let me know what you think.",102.5,Alice,5,
