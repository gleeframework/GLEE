"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  This is a fair price given the value it holds for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting high at $1,750,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still being above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. 
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair price for both of us, hoping to build some rapport and avoid immediate rejection. 
* **Strategy:** This first round is about gauging Bob's interest and seeing how high he's willing to go. If he rejects, I can adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  While $1,400,000 is above Bob's stated value of $800,000, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **Strategy:**  I'm going to counteroffer Bob, hoping to push him closer to my desired price point.  I'll use this round to see if he's genuinely interested in a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not able to go below $1,600,000 at this time. I'm confident this product will provide significant value to your business.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm lowering my price slightly from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000, showing some flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal but emphasizing the product's value. I'm also setting the stage for continued negotiation.
* **Strategy:** I'm testing the waters to see if Bob is truly serious about purchasing.  If he rejects again, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Selling to John:** Bob's latest offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  I've already shown flexibility in my counteroffers, and it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my price expectations. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Instead of risking further rounds of negotiation that may lead to a lower price or a failed deal, I'm choosing to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John.  
* **Strategy:** It's important to recognize that time is a valuable resource in negotiations.  While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, I'm prioritizing securing a sale that meets my minimum financial goal."
