"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  $950,000 is still too high for Bob's budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still within a range that might be acceptable to her given she values the product at $1,000,000. It leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $920,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still better to try and negotiate further. There are still rounds available, and Bob could potentially get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. It shows that Bob is willing to compromise but is firm on his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to Bob's limit, there are still a few rounds left to negotiate.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further.  There's always the option to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 885000}
```

This counteroffer is a small increase from Bob's previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  It's still lower than Alice's offer, leaving room for a potential deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $890,000 is very close to Bob's limit. There are only three rounds left, and  it's unlikely Alice will come down much further.  It's a good deal for Bob, considering his budget and the alternative of buying from John for $800,000."
