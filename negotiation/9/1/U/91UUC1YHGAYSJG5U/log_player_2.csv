"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its worth. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer is too high.  It's a good starting point for negotiation, but I can aim for a much better price.  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit margin for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my target price, it's still higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer closer to my initial proposal, as there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000. This offers you a significant profit while still allowing me to stay within my financial limits.  I hope we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $1,150,000 is still too high. I'll make one more counteroffer, aiming for a price between our last offers. If she doesn't accept, I might have to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,150,000 is still out of my range.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This price reflects a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. I hope we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,150,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to give you a slight concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still higher than my target. I'll make one final counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll need to consider buying from John as the price from Alice is too close to John's offer for me to be comfortable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,125,000 is still a little too high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,087,500. This price is a fair compromise, giving you a solid profit while allowing me to acquire the product within my budget.  I believe this is our final opportunity to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1087500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,087,500. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,120,000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still higher than my target.  I'm running out of time, and at this price, it's only slightly better than buying from John.  I'd rather go with John, as I'm already at the end of my negotiation attempts. There's not much more room for compromise and I'm too close to John's price to risk another round with Alice."
