``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is based on my assessment of its value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your desired price. While it's tempting to accept and get a deal done, it's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a safer option, but there's still potential to get closer to your desired price of $1,100,000 by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, I'm not able to accept it at this time. It's below the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value to you, and it leaves room for both of us to make a deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
