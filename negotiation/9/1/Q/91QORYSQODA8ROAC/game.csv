"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm looking to get a fair price for it. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your initial target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
