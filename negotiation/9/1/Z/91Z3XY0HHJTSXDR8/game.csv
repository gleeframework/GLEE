"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is quite valuable, and $90 is cutting it a bit close for me. Could you meet me halfway at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
