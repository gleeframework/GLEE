"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential gains.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I appreciate your offer of $850,000, the value this product brings is considerably higher. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go below $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective and appreciate the revised offer.  However, $1,200,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
