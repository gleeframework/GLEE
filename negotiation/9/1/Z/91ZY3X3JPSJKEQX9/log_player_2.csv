{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering the product for $120. This is a good deal, but you can potentially get it for a lower price.  By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $100. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a good profit for my product. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is $110, which is still within your budget of $150.
* You've already made a counteroffer and been rejected, so it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult. 
* Accepting the offer at $110 saves you $40 compared to buying from John."
