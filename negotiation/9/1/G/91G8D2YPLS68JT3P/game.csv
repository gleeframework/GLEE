"I'm interested in your product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  However, $1400000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. Let's split the difference and try $1700000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
