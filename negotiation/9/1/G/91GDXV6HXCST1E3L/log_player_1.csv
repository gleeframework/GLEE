Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible. While $15,500 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $13,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to move much higher than his current offer. While he's getting closer to my minimum, it's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than risk Bob walking away in a later round."
