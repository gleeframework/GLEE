"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement on this.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,075,000, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that's a bit closer to my original offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000 for this round.  This is a small step closer to your offer, and I believe it's a good compromise.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
