{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  At $110, you're still making a profit, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** This shows you're willing to compromise and encourages Bob to engage.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  It's easy for Bob to understand and respond to. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering at $100. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while being closer to Bob's desired price.  It's important to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate while also sticking to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $95? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my price point with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $105. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $105, which is a small compromise from my previous offer. This demonstrates flexibility without completely conceding to Bob's price. It's also a reasonable midpoint that could potentially lead to a successful agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $98, but no higher. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  While I'd prefer to have made a sale to Bob, the negotiations have gone on long enough, and I'm not willing to go below my minimum price.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
