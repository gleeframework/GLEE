"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $95? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $105. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $98, but no higher. That's the best I can do.",98.0,Bob,6,
