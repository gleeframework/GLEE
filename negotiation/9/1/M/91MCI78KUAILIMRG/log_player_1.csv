Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my business needs. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am proposing a price of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly above his perceived value. There's room to push him a bit further before accepting or going with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to understand the value of what I'm offering. I've already adjusted my price significantly.  I can do $1,100,000, but this is absolutely my final offer.  I need a decision today, otherwise, I'm moving forward with another buyer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. Based on my budget constraints, I am proposing a final offer of $1,085,000. I hope this aligns with your considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,085,000 gives us a significant profit over his initial offer and avoids the risk of him walking away.  It's a good deal at this point."
