"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price. I'm also aware that I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe there's potential to get more from Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I want to show flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position. This move also allows me to assess Bob's seriousness and gauge his potential willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and we're now only $100,000 apart. It's a good deal, and I'm confident I can't get significantly more. I'll take the offer and secure the sale."
