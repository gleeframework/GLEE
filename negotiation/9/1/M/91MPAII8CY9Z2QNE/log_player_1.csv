"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows I'm open to a deal while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I have 9 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate a better price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This still gives you a good deal, and I can make it work on my end. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  How about $11,000?  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum value, I still have 6 rounds left. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. That's a fair price for both of us, and it would be great to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit short, but I'm willing to go up to $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and we can close the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has come up to $11,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. With only 4 rounds left, I don't have enough time to negotiate a price that would satisfy me. It's better to cut my losses and sell the product to John for my desired price."
