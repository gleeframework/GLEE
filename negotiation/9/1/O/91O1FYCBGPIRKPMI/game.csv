"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great value, considering the product's worth to me is at least $800000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've seen similar products going for in the market.",925000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $925000 + $12500, which is $937500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",937500.0,Alice,3,
