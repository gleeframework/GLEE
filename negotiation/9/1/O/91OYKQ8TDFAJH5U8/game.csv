,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is significantly lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,600,000 is my best offer. This price still reflects the value and unique features of the product. I'm confident this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
