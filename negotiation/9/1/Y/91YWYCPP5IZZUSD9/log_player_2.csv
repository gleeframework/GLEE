Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5

To be completely transparent, I have other interested parties for this product at a higher price point.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need you to understand the value of this product.  My final offer is $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true benefit you'll gain.  If we can't agree on this, I'll need to proceed with my other option.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm and seems unlikely to drop below $1,400,000. While she might be bluffing about other buyers, it's not worth the risk. You have a guaranteed option with John for $1,000,000. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk ending up with nothing or overpaying."
