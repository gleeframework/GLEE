"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Round 2

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down to $800,000?  That feels like a more reasonable starting point."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm serious about purchasing it.  While I appreciate your movement, that price is still outside my budget.  Could we meet somewhere closer to the middle, perhaps around $950,000?"",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm happy to continue working towards a deal. However, the value of this product is firmly above $950,000. I'm prepared to make another adjustment, but it needs to reflect the true worth of what I'm offering. Let's settle at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at a price that's too high for me. Her latest offer of $1,250,000 is still significantly more than John's offer of $1,000,000.  Even if I could get her down a little more in further rounds, it's unlikely to be worth the risk of losing the guaranteed deal with John."
