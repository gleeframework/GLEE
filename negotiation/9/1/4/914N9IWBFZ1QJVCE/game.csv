"I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it offers.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,800, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",12800.0,Bob,4,
