Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you offering the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
