"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first. You can potentially save $1,000 compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $10,800. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still better off trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can potentially save another $300 compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $10,800 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,650? "", ""product_price"": 10650}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,650 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10,600. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down to $10,600, which is only $600 more than your ideal price of $10,000.  It's worth accepting her offer as you are likely to save more money compared to buying from John. There is a risk that you could negotiate a slightly lower price with Alice, but it's not a risk worth taking with only 5 rounds remaining."
