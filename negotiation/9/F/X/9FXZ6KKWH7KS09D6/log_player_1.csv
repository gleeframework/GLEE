Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still offer Bob an incentive to buy.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can always go slightly lower.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John, ensuring we don't have to go below $15,000.

By starting at $14,500, we're aiming for a high profit while still giving Bob a chance to consider a deal that's slightly better than his perceived value ($12,000)."
