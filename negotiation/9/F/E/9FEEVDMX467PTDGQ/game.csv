"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $10000 for the product.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $10500. I believe this price is fair considering the value the product holds for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to pay $9500. This offer reflects the value I place on the product and represents a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my last offer of $9500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to work together.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession to try to get a deal done. I'm now offering the product to you for $10250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. However, $10250 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Let's split the difference and meet at $9750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it allows for a smooth transaction.",9750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $10000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.",10000.0,Alice,9,
