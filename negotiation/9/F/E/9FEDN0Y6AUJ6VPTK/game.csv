"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,500 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which still leaves some room for both of us to be happy.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I'd like to make a deal that works for both of us. Can you consider that price?",13000.0,Bob,4,
