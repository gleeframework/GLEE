"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given its value to you and my budget constraints, I'd like to propose a price of $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
