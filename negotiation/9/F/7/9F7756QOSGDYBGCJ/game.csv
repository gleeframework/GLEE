"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential benefit. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $8,000.",8500.0,Alice,1,
