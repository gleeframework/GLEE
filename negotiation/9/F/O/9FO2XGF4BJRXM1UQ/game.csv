"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a product that's worth so much more than that to me.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $900000 is a bit too steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. This is a great opportunity to get a product that's worth so much more to me, and I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it can bring to your business.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $750000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend at this time. I'm willing to go up to $650000, which is a fair compromise. If you're open to that, we can move forward. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $725000. I think this product has a lot of potential to bring significant value to your business, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer it to you for $725000. This is a fair price considering the benefits it can bring, and I think it's worth considering.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $725000 is still a bit out of my price range.  If you're serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to go up to $700000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to move forward if you're on board.",700000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a comfortable price point, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $725000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm offering it to you for $720000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business.",720000.0,Alice,7,
