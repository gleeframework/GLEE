"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is my best offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to settle at $880,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to work together to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $880,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you the product for $920,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  To be honest, anything over $900,000 is going to be a tough sell for me.  If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your constraints, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not giving away too much value. I can offer you the product for $915,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make, and I hope it meets your requirements.",915000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this negotiation has gone on long enough.  I'm willing to offer you $905,000.  Take it or leave it.  This is my final offer. ",905000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your directness, and I respect your final offer. However, I'm not willing to accept $905,000, as it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $912,500. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",912500.0,Alice,9,
