Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, trying to sell to Bob first at a higher price might net you a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 is a strong starting point. It's a price that's still appealing compared to your minimum acceptable price ($150) but also allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Positive Messaging:** The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  Keep in mind that Bob only values the product at $120.  There's a chance he might outright reject this offer.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob counters. However, don't go below $150, as you can always sell to John at that price."
