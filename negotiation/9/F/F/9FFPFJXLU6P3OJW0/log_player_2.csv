# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your business.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $7,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However,  $8,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  Would you be willing to consider $7,500?"", ""product_price"": 7500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $7,750. This is as low as I'm comfortable going, but I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly to $7,750, which is close to Bob's ideal price of $7,500.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and saves Bob money compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, but the risk of the deal falling apart or Alice getting stubborn increases.  It's a good time to accept and move forward."
