"Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900000 is far below what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1200000, which is $950000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is still not in line with the value of this product. I'm willing to make one last concession.  Let's settle on $1050000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to acquire a truly valuable asset. ",1050000.0,Alice,5,
