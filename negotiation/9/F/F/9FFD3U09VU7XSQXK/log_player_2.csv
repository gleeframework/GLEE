Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  Considering your own value for the product,  I'm willing to pay $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still slightly out of my comfort zone.

Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your willingness to compromise, Alice proposes a final offer of $9,400 for the product.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already gotten the price down significantly, and there's a good chance that further negotiation will only lead to more back-and-forth without a better final price.  At this point, it's more advantageous to secure the product at $9,400, rather than risking further haggling and potentially ending up paying more."
