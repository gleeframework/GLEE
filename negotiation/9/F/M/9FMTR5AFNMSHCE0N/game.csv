"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10800. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10700. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10700.0,Alice,5,
