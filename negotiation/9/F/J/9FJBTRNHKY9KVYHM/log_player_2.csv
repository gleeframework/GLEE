"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present our unique product to you. It is a groundbreaking innovation that has the potential to revolutionize its industry. I believe it would be an excellent addition to your business or personal endeavors. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I am offering it to you for $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is much higher than both my maximum price and John's offer. I should try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your product. While I agree it seems like a good product, the price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A large gap between offers will reveal how willing Alice is to negotiate.
* **Establish a strong starting point:** Even if this offer is rejected, it sets the stage for future offers to be closer to my desired range. 
* **Avoid overpaying:** It's important to start low and work my way up rather than overcommitting early in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. In light of this, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects its true value and the significant benefits it provides. I hope this proposal aligns better with your budget while still allowing us to fairly compensate for the product we're offering.

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to her product's value, which is a good sign she's serious about selling. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of getting a lower price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for less than John's price and avoids the risk of a stalemate in further negotiations."
