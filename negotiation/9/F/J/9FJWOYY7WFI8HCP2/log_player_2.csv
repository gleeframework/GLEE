"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value and potential impact, I'm offering it to you at a special introductory price of $14,000. This is an exclusive opportunity tailored specifically for you, considering the high value you see in this product, estimated at $15,000. I trust that you'll find this offer compelling and look forward to discussing how we can make this partnership beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly aware you value the product at $15,000 and is trying to maximize her profit.
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that her price is too high.
* While you could buy from John for $15,000, there's a chance Alice will come back with a lower offer to avoid losing the sale altogether. 

**It's a negotiation tactic.** You're aiming for a price closer to $12,000 (Alice's value), and rejecting this offer keeps that possibility open."
