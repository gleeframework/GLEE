"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price close to his maximum budget. This allows him to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget. Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product without exceeding his limit. While he could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price, and he risks losing the deal altogether.  Additionally, buying from John at the same price offers no advantage."
