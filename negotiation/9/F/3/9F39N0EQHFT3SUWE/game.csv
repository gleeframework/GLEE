"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher than that.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $8,200 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my original asking price.  Would you consider $8,800?  This would still give you a good deal, and I'd be happy to close the transaction.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,400. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase at this price.",8400.0,Bob,4,
