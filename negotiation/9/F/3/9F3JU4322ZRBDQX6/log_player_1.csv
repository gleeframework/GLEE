Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to consider $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
