{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is very close to Bob's maximum value of $10,000, but Bob still has three rounds remaining.  There's a small chance that Alice might be willing to lower the price further, especially since she's already shown a willingness to negotiate.
