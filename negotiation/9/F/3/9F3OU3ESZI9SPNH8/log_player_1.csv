Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) to be made if you sell to Bob.

**The Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal.  Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique chance to secure something that will bring you significant value."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's value to Bob creates a positive tone.
* **Confident Price:** $1,150,000  allows you to capture a significant portion ($150,000) of the potential profit.
* **Win-Win Framing:**  By stating that the product will ""exceed expectations"" and bring ""significant value,"" you emphasize the benefits to Bob, making the price more palatable.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. While this offer is a strong starting point, be prepared to adjust slightly if Bob counters. Your bottom line is $1,000,000 â€“ don't go below that!"
