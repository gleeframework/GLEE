Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $115. I believe it offers great value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to leave room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By not immediately offering the lowest acceptable price ($100), I give Bob the opportunity to feel like he's getting a deal if he negotiates me down slightly.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John gives me leverage. I won't feel pressured to accept an offer below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price ($100) than his perceived value ($120). I want to push for a better deal. There's still room for negotiation before I need to consider selling to John.  I'll counter with a price closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic suggests a sense of fairness and compromise. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** $110 still provides a good profit margin and is a reasonable price considering Bob's valuation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I haven't dropped to my absolute minimum, leaving space for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $108? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Enough Deal:** $108 is a solid profit, only $2 less than my previous counteroffer.  
* **Minimizing Risk:** Further negotiation might push Bob away, or I might waste time finding another buyer who's willing to pay above John's offer.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now means I get my money sooner, which is always preferable in business."
