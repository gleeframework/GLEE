"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer.  How about $11,000? This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,500? This is the best I can do, but I'm really interested in the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still not quite there for me. I'm prepared to go down to $11,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
