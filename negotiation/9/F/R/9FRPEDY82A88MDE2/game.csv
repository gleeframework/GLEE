"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product, how about we split the difference and settle on $95?  It's still a great deal for you, and it works for me.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $92.50. Would you be willing to consider this price?",92.5,Bob,4,
