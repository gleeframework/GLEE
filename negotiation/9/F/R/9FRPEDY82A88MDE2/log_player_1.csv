Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I believe the product is worth to me ($100) to leave some room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Strategy:**  By starting high, I aim to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate down to a price closer to my target range. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to counteroffer to try and secure a better price.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to close the gap but still remaining above my minimum.  I'll also remind him of the value of the product and my ability to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product, how about we split the difference and settle on $95?  It's still a great deal for you, and it works for me."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering a compromise at $95, which is halfway between my initial offer of $110 and Bob's counteroffer of $90. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while reiterating the value of the product and emphasizing that $95 is still a good deal for him.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially reach an agreement without needing to further negotiate. I'm also reminding Bob of the value of the product to incentivize him to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $92.50. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $92.5 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target of $100.  Since I can sell to John for $100, there's no need to continue negotiating with Bob.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Guaranteed Value:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $100, which is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in further concessions that could bring me below my target price.
* **Time Efficiency:** Selling to John is a quick and straightforward solution that avoids further back-and-forth negotiation."
