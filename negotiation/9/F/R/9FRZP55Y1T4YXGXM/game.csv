"Hi Alice,  $20000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $14000?  It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10000 is still a little low for me.  Let's try $12000.  That's a good compromise, and it gives us both a fair deal.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $11000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize the transaction.",11000.0,Bob,6,
