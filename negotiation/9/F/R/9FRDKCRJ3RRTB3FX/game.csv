"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a lower price of $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $925,000? That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $925,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for a unique product like this. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price.  Let's make this simple.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is my final offer, as it's a fair price and I need to move forward soon.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your straightforwardness, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one last push to try to meet in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1,075,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $975,000 if that's the best you can do. This is my final concession, and I need to make a decision soon.
