Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $925,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for a unique product like this. What do you think?

This is a good deal for Bob. He's getting the product for $225,000 less than John's price and Alice is unlikely to go much lower."
