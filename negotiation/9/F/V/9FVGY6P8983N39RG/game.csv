"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8500? I'm confident this product is worth that much to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price at $8500. I'd like to try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $7500? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value I'll get from the product.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7500 is still a little low for me.  I'm confident the value of this product will be worth it to you. How about we settle on $8000?  This is my final offer. Let me know what you decide.",8000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price at $8000. I've already decided that I'm willing to pay up to $7000 for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000.",7500.0,Bob,6,
