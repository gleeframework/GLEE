Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** The message frames the price as connected to the product's inherent value, not just an arbitrary number. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, which is crucial in this type of bargaining.
* **Alternative Option:**  I know I have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $1,000,000, which gives me a strong position and the ability to walk away from a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle somewhere. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to negotiate within a reasonable range. I'll counter to see if we can reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer and for engaging in this discussion.  I appreciate your perspective on the value. I've considered your proposal, and while I'm eager to reach a deal, I'm targeting a price closer to $1,200,000. This reflects the true value and potential this product holds.  Are you open to exploring options within that range?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Appreciate:**  I start by acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing my desire to reach an agreement. This builds rapport and shows I'm taking his input seriously.
* **Firm but Flexible:** I'm holding relatively firm to a price point closer to my initial offer, but I'm using softer language (""targeting,"" ""exploring options"") to signal some flexibility.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value proposition to justify the higher price. 
* **Guiding the Negotiation:** By proposing a range rather than a fixed price, I'm giving Bob some room to maneuver while still guiding the negotiation in my desired direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 exceeds my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob will walk away, and securing a $50,000 profit is a positive outcome. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal without risking the certainty of selling to John."
