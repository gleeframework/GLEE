"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle somewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer and for engaging in this discussion.  I appreciate your perspective on the value. I've considered your proposal, and while I'm eager to reach a deal, I'm targeting a price closer to $1,200,000. This reflects the true value and potential this product holds.  Are you open to exploring options within that range?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
