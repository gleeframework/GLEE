Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).**  This gives you room to negotiate.
* **It's less than the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000).** This incentivizes Bob to accept the offer.

By starting with a higher offer, you can try to secure a better price without immediately alienating Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my desired price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I can likely get closer to my target price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. Selling to John for $800,000 would be a significant loss for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This price still gives you a good deal while allowing me to earn a fair profit. Let's try to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
