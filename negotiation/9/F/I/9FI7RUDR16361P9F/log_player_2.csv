"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's potential to negotiate a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for less than $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This price still gives you a good deal while allowing me to earn a fair profit. Let's try to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's still lower than the initial offer of $1,200,000 and significantly less than buying from John for $1,500,000. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save money and secure the product. While there's always the possibility of further negotiation, accepting at this point seems like a smart move considering the potential risks of further negotiation."
