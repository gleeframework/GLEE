"Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll offer it to you for $13,250. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle on $12,875?  It's a fair price for both of us.",12875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll offer it to you for $13,187.50. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",13187.5,Alice,5,
