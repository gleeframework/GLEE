"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $135 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $142.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",142.5,Alice,5,
