Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my potential earnings. I'm also stating my willingness to negotiate to show good faith and encourage Bob to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
I'm offering Bob my minimum price, which is still more than what he's willing to pay but less than my ideal price. This shows flexibility while still protecting my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $135. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject it and try to secure a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $135 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $142.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 142.5}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  Splitting the difference with Bob demonstrates fairness while still keeping the price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $142.50 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's latest offer is closer to my minimum price, we are now reaching a point where the negotiations are becoming more time-consuming. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price of $150, I'm going to sell the product to John to avoid further negotiation."
