Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $135. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but I think $135 is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly not willing to budge much below $135.  While we could continue negotiating, the potential savings are getting smaller, and there's a risk Alice will dig in further. It's not worth the risk of a stalemate, especially since we have a guaranteed option with John at $150."
