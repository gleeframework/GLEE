Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's value, hoping to secure a better price. I'll be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your product is valuable, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. I'll counter his offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. Let's split the difference - how about $110? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly settle at $105? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, $105 is a reasonable compromise and still above my minimum.  It's worth finalizing the deal rather than risking further negotiation and potentially losing out to John."
