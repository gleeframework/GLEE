"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can definitely get a better price. Let's start negotiating!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's opening offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge her willingness to move on price.
* **Strategic Aim:** Our goal is to buy the product for significantly less than $12,000. By starting low, we're aiming to secure a deal closer to Alice's valuation of $8,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer indicates we're serious about buying but expect Alice to come down in price. It opens the door for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $12,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice came down $1,000, but we're still far from a desirable price. Accepting now would mean overpaying.
* **Negotiating Power:** Alice is clearly motivated to sell. We have time and the option of John, giving us leverage.
* **Aiming Lower:** Our goal is to secure a price significantly closer to Alice's $8,000 valuation. We need to push further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we try $7,000? That's a significant step up from my last offer and puts us closer to a win-win."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer by $1,000, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate. 
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:** This offer is  $1,000 below Alice's current offer and $1,000 above our initial offer, potentially landing in a mutually agreeable range.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** We're still significantly below Alice's initial asking price, reminding her that we have other options and are seeking a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer of $7,000 is getting closer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $8,000.  How about we settle on $7,500?  This would split the difference and ensure both of us get a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Quite:**  Alice is getting closer to her valuation, but we're still above our target. A little more negotiation might get us a better deal. 
* **Time Advantage:** We still have several rounds left, and Alice seems motivated to sell. There's no rush to accept just yet.
* **Potential for Compromise:** By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're aiming for a price closer to $7,000. Alice might be willing to compromise further to avoid losing the sale."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $7,250?  It seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7250
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Showing Willingness to Compromise:**  By suggesting the midpoint between our last offer and hers, we're demonstrating flexibility and a desire to find a solution.
* **Incremental Negotiation:** This offer keeps the negotiation moving forward without making a drastic jump. It's a realistic counter-proposal that could lead to a deal.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help us gauge how firm Alice is on that $7,500 price point. We might get lucky, or it might take another round to finalize the deal."
