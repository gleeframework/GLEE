"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $12,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we try $7,000? That's a significant step up from my last offer and puts us closer to a win-win.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer of $7,000 is getting closer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $8,000.  How about we settle on $7,500?  This would split the difference and ensure both of us get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $7,250?  It seems like a fair compromise.",7250.0,Bob,6,
