Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

This offer gives Bob a $4,000 discount from your minimum acceptable price, which is still more than what the product is worth to him.  This is a good strategy because:

* **It's likely Bob will accept:** The offer is attractive to him, giving him a good deal.
* **It's close to your minimum:** You're still getting very close to your minimum price, maximizing your potential earnings. 

While you could offer a higher price, there's a higher chance of Bob rejecting it, forcing you to sell to John.  This offer balances risk and reward for you."
