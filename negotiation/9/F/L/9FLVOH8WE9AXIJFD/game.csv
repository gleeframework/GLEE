"Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.  Let's try to find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,4,
