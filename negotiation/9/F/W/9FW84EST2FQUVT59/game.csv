"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth and the market value. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm not able to accept it at this time. Given the product's unique value, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, as it's well below the product's true worth.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $975,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,012,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,012,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth and the market value. Can you consider this offer?",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $995,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's very close to your last offer.  Let's reach an agreement and move forward.",995000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",985000.0,Bob,8,
