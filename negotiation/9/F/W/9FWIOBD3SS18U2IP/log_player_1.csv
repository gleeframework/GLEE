Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet the $22,000 price point. Would you consider reducing the price to $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could come down to $19,000. This offer reflects the value you're getting and allows me to make a fair deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Could you consider lowering the price to $16,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Taking $16,000 is better than risking a lower offer from Bob in future rounds or accepting the $15,000 from John."
