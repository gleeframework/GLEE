"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum price, it's still above your ideal target. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal by counter-offering. You have 9 more rounds to negotiate and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my maximum budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant move.  It's a bold attempt to secure a much lower price, but it's still within a reasonable range given your maximum budget and Alice's likely desire to sell. This sets the stage for further negotiation and potentially leads to a win-win situation for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident that this price is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your ideal target of $1,000,000.  You have the option to buy from John for that price, but it's still worth exploring if you can secure a better deal with Alice.  Rejecting this offer allows for more negotiation rounds and the potential for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is your final offer, directly matching your maximum budget and John's offer.  It clearly states your willingness to pay the maximum and emphasizes the fairness of the price based on the product's value to you.  It's a strong move that puts the ball back in Alice's court, forcing her to decide if she wants to close the deal or risk losing a sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price significantly, it's still $25,000 above your ideal target.  You have only five rounds left.  Given the limited time and the fact that you can buy the product from John for your target price, it's more advantageous to accept John's offer.  It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice within the remaining rounds."
