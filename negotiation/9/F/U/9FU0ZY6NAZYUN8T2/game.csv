"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $8250?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. While $8250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider selling the product to me for $7750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8000, which is my minimum. This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",8000.0,Alice,5,
