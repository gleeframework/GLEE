"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, considering its potential. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your persistence. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,450,000.  This is a significant reduction and a very fair offer, considering the value this product brings.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
