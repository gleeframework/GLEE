"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $180 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product but I'd only be able to pay $100.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for the interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to work with you. I'd be happy to accept $140.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  It's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $120 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? That would be a good deal for both of us, and I think it's fair given the value of the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
