Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. I want to see if I can get him to budge closer to my minimum value of $150.  This also gives me room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $120 is below my minimum value of $150.  I'll counter with a price closer to my target, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160} 
```

I'm going to counter with $160. This is closer to my minimum value of $150, but still leaves room for negotiation if needed. It also shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $140, which is above my minimum value of $150.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me and worth accepting.  It's better than selling to John for $150, and it avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower offer or a breakdown in talks."
