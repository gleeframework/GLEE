"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice is starting the negotiation quite high. There's a good chance you can get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

Reasoning: I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This leaves room for negotiation while still keeping the price within a reasonable range of my $15,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but we're not at a price I'm ready to accept yet. I'll counteroffer again, moving closer to her price but still aiming for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

Reasoning: I'm offering Alice her product's actual value to her. This is a fair deal for both of us, and it's still significantly less than my maximum budget and John's offer. There's a good chance she'll accept, but even if she counters, we're getting very close to a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think the product is worth more than $10,000 to me. I can do $11,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning:  While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly signaling that $11,500 is her bottom line. Accepting this offer gets me the product for significantly less than John's $15,000 price, and continuing to haggle might make Alice pull out of the deal entirely."
