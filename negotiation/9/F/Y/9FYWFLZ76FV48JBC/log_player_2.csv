"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high.  Rejecting and counter-offering again is the best move to try and bring the price down further."

While $13,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still a bit too high.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can get it down further."
