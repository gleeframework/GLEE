"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations. Given its value to you, I propose a starting price of $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** You are willing to pay a maximum of $12,000 and Alice is offering $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's early in the game:** You have 10 rounds to reach an agreement, so it's worthwhile to try and get a better price.
* **You have a backup option:**  Buying from John for $12,000 gives you leverage during negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer by suggesting a price of $9,500 for the product. This price reflects its value while remaining competitive for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  Alice has moved closer to your price, but there's still a $500 gap. 
* **You're still within your budget:** You can afford to hold out for a lower price.
* **Maintain leverage:** Rejecting the offer keeps you in control and shows Alice you're serious about getting a good deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,500 is still a little high for me. Given the product's value, I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to offer $9,250, which is a fair compromise and a significant step closer to reaching a deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. I am willing to consider a price of $9,400 for the product. This offers a balance between reflecting its value and ensuring a fair deal for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** Alice's offer of $9,400 is only $200 more than your last counteroffer, and within your budget. 
* **Time is running out:**  You're halfway through the rounds, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While you could try to push for a lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or pushing back significantly is high. It's wiser to secure the deal at this point."
