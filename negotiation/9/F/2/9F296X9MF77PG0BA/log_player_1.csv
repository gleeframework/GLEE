Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $170 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob.  $170 is better than $150, but I think I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $170 is still a bit low for me.  How about $185?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 185}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $185 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $177.50. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $177.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $177.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $177.50 is better than $150 and we're getting closer to my ideal price.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with the chance of having to sell to John for a lower price."
