Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first since I know you're interested.  I think a price of $140 would be fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Avoid Insulting a Good Offer:**  While Alice could try for more, a price much higher might make Bob feel like it's not worth engaging. This offer balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing the sale."
