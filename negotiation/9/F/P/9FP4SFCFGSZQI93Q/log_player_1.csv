Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is closer to my ideal outcome ($1,500,000) than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is not too aggressive, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage a positive negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I will analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on the information provided. 
* If Bob's counteroffer is not acceptable, I will consider my options, potentially offering a counter-counteroffer or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,350,000. I think that's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While it's closer to my ideal outcome, it still falls below the $1,200,000 threshold I've set. Selling to John would be a better outcome in this scenario.
* **I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob:** By rejecting his offer, I can try to push him closer to my ideal price. There's a chance he might be willing to budge a bit more.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This will show him I'm serious about making a deal but also not willing to settle for less than my product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $1,400,000? This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward. Let's finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer to keep the negotiation going. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my previous offer and his offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to my ideal outcome.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting we ""finalize this"" to encourage Bob to accept my offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my counter-offer, we close the deal.
* If Bob rejects my counter-offer, I will evaluate his next offer and decide whether to accept, reject and counter-offer, or sell to John."
