"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can aim to get a lower price, as Alice's minimum is $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer opens the door for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,350,000. I think that's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial price while still being above her minimum.  It demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $1,400,000? This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward. Let's finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,400,000 is a good price for Bob. It's lower than John's offer and closer to his desired price point.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price is too high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a decent price."
