"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $100 for your product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $120. I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a bit in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I still believe $100 is a fair price for this product. Could you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. He's not budging from $100, and I'm not willing to sell it for that low. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get him closer to my desired price. If not, I'll go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. Let's try $105. It's a compromise, and a better price for you than my previous offer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
