"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique nature and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,500,000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your position, the value of this product is substantial. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $1,250,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
