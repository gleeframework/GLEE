"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I value it at, and still allows you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair price considering the value I place on this product.  Let's meet in the middle, how about we close this deal at $13,500?
