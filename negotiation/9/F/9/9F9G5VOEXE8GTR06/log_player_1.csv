{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I value it at, and still allows you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's below your minimum value:** You're still making a profit and avoiding a loss.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** It's significantly lower than what he's willing to pay.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly, but still maintain a good profit margin. 

By starting with this offer, you're maximizing your chances of getting a good price while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm aiming to stay under $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above your minimum value:** $12,500 is greater than your minimum of $15,000.
* **There's room for negotiation:** You can still counteroffer and potentially get closer to your desired price.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed profit:** However, it might be worth seeing if you can get a better deal from Bob before accepting the guaranteed $15,000 from John.

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, you maintain the potential for a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair price considering the value I place on this product.  Let's meet in the middle, how about we close this deal at $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain a profitable price:**  $13,500 is still above your minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Show flexibility:**  You're demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still protecting your interests.
* **Appeal to fairness:**  You're framing the offer as a fair compromise, hoping to entice Bob to agree.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while increasing your chances of getting a better price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and agree on $13,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your desired price:** $13,000 is very close to your ideal price of $13,500.
* **Guaranteed sale:**  Accepting this offer guarantees you a sale without the risk of further negotiation.
* **Minimizes risk of rejection:** While you could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Bob might reject your counteroffer.  

Considering the proximity to your ideal price and the certainty of a sale, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy in this round."
