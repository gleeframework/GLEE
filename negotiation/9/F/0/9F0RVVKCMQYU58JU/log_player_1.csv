Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it holds significant value for you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000. Offering it slightly below that ($11,500) aims to secure the highest possible profit. 
* **Time Value:**  While Alice has a guaranteed $10,000 from John, selling to Bob quickly might be more desirable than waiting.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate, potentially increasing the final price even further.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limits. 
* A more aggressive starting price (closer to $12,000) might be attempted, but it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright."
