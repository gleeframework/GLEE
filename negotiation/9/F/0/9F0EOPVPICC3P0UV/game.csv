"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm happy to offer $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your stated value. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it's my final offer. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1,030,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll consider selling the product to another buyer.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
