"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I believe is worth a lot. I'm starting with an offer of $20000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget. It's too risky to accept without knowing the product's value to Alice.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know if you're open to negotiating further."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will hopefully make her realize that she needs to come down in price if she wants to sell the product. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is still a good deal for me if the product is worth it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $17500?  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still leaving room for you to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still too high for me.  $17,500 is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping to negotiate a lower price. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,500 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $13,000, which is still below my maximum budget of $12,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but still believe we can find a better price.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a more productive negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer.  $13000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise a little further. How about $15500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would ensure a smooth transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still not willing to pay that much.  It's getting risky because I'm nearing my maximum budget and I haven't seen the product yet. I'll counteroffer one more time to try and get a better deal before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $15,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $14,250.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $14,250, which is the middle ground between our last two offers.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying and that I'm willing to meet her halfway. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enough to convince her to accept and make a deal.  If not, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John, even though it would mean paying more."
