"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I believe is worth a lot. I'm starting with an offer of $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know if you're open to negotiating further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While I need to make a profit, I'm not willing to drop down to $10,000 just yet. I believe the product has more value than that and I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $17,500?  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still leaving room for you to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17500 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000. It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe the product holds more value. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer.  $13,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise a little further. How about $15,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would ensure a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $15500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $14250.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is still below my minimum. Given the limited time and the possibility of getting $15,000 from John, I'm going to sell the product to John."
