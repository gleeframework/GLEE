"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to offer $11,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product would bring to me. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
