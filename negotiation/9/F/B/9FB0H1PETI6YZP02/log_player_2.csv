"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $120, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, close to his maximum budget, but still leaving room for negotiation. He's aiming to show Alice he's serious about buying but also won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $100, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. Bob has a reliable alternative in John, who is selling the same product for $80. Therefore, it's still in Bob's best interest to continue negotiating with Alice.  There's still room for Alice to lower her price further, and Bob might be able to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $90, which is a fair price considering your offer.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price. He's showing Alice that he's willing to pay a fair price, but is still determined to stay within his budget.  He's increased his offer by $5 from the previous round, demonstrating that he's serious about the deal but not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you the product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still higher than his target of $80.  He knows he can get the product from John for $80, so there's no immediate urgency to accept. Continuing to negotiate could potentially result in a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $95 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50.  This is a fair price, and we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again trying to split the difference, showing Alice that he's willing to compromise while still staying within his budget. By offering $92.50, he's indicating that he's serious about buying the product, but he's not willing to pay more than $90. This offer demonstrates his commitment to finding a solution that works for both of them."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $98. I think this product is worth it, and I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you the product for $98. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $98 is still above Bob's desired budget of $80.  While Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there is no guarantee that she will budge further.  Considering that Bob has a reliable alternative in John, who is willing to sell the product for $80, it is more beneficial for Bob to accept John's offer and secure the product for the price he is comfortable with.  By buying from John, Bob avoids the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice and potentially ending up with a price higher than his budget."
