"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is considerably below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $12,500. This feels like a win-win. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you have a budget, and I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to meet me at $11,500? This is my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $11,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12,000.",11000.0,Bob,6,
