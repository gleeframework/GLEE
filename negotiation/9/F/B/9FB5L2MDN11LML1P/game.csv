"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential for profit, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, considering my budget and the current market situation, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $2,300,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $1,900,000 is out of my price range. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. This amount aims to meet somewhere in between our valuations and could potentially lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
