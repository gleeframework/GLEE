Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, I want to start high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The $19,000 offer allows for potential negotiation. Bob might try to haggle, and I can always come down a bit, staying above my minimum. 
* **Emphasizing value:** While not revealing my minimum price, I highlight the product's value to Bob, hoping to justify the higher price.

This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while still giving Bob a chance to consider the offer. If he rejects it, I can still sell to John at my desired price."
