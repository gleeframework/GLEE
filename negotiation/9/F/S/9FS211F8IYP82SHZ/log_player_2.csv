"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love.  I'm asking for $125 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

The product is worth $150 to Bob, and Alice is asking $125. This is a good deal for Bob, but he can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, $125 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $110.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50?  That way we're both getting a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $150 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $117.5. This is a good price for Bob, especially since he has already rejected one offer and doesn't want to risk getting a worse offer from Alice or having to buy from John for a higher price."
