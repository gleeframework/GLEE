Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still staying above my minimum price. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning listing it publicly might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

This approach aims for a win-win situation where Bob gets a product he values at a price he finds reasonable, and I secure a profit significantly higher than my minimum."
