"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $70. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and sell it to me for $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $75.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $82.50? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my value for the product. Let me know what you think.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of a price around $78. Would you be willing to meet me at $78?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $78 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $80. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit. What do you say?",80.0,Alice,5,
