{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice. $100 is a good starting point, but there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 
 
I'm offering $80, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better price. $90 is closer to my limit, but I can likely get it for less with another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $85.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to get a good price."
