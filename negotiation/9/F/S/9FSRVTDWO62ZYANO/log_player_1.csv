"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Clear communication:**  I'm upfront about my minimum price and express a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  By offering $140, I allow for Bob to counter with a price closer to his value while still leaving some profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum value of $150 and wouldn't be a good deal for me. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. There's still room for negotiation, and I can make a counteroffer to get closer to a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John is a backup:** Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me the leverage to be firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $100 is too far below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $125. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also making a counteroffer to show I'm still willing to negotiate. 
* **Splitting the difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic. By meeting in the middle, I'm showing flexibility while still trying to get a reasonable price.
* **Maintaining a profit:** $125 is still above my minimum of $150, so I'm still getting a profit."
