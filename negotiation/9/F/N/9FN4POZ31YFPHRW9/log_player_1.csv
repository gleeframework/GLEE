Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing the risk of Bob rejecting the deal.  Here's why:

* **Profit:**  A price of $140 earns you $20 more than selling to John.
* **Likelihood of Acceptance:** Bob values the product at $150, so a $140 offer is still attractive to him. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** While a higher offer could potentially earn you more, it also increases the chance of Bob rejecting the deal, forcing you to sell to John for a lower price."
