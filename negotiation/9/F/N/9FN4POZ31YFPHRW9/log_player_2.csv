"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $150. 
* Alice's offer is $140, which is still more than your maximum budget.
* While rejecting Alice's offer means you have to buy from John at $150, it's still within your budget and a better deal than paying Alice's price."
