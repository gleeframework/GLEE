"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,750? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. ",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you, but $8,750 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,900.  That's a fair compromise and keeps the deal moving forward. Let me know what you think.",8900.0,Alice,5,
