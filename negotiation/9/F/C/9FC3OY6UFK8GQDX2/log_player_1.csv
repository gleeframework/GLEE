Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down if he finds the price too high. This increases the chances of a sale above my minimum.
* **Confident Presentation:**  The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing my minimum price, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know about John's offer.
* Bob's perception of the product's value is key. If he sees it as worth significantly less than $15,000, he's likely to reject the offer outright."
