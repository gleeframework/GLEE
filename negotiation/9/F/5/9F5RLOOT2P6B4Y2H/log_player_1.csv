Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$140** is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, and it leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message** is friendly and invites Bob to start the negotiation.

By starting with a price slightly lower than what the product is worth to Bob, I increase the chances of him accepting the initial offer. However, I've also left enough room for negotiation if he wants to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I can still do better. By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a higher price. I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $130 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $135?  That's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing my willingness to compromise. 
* $135 is a reasonable counteroffer, closer to his price but still above my minimum.
* The message is friendly and emphasizes a ""win-win"" scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $132 is only $2 less than my last counteroffer.  It's a good compromise and is above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's in my best interest to accept this offer and finalize the sale rather than risking further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
