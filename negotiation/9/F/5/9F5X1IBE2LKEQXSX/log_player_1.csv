{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point - it's a fair price that's still a good deal for me, while also leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $140. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering to sell the product to Bob for $135. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from my previous offer. It should be appealing enough for him to consider, while still leaving me a decent profit."
