"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a better price than $150 from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. By offering $130, he's showing Alice he's serious about buying the product, but also trying to get a lower price than her initial offer. This is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is within Bob's budget and a better price than John's offer. It's not ideal, but it's a good compromise and saves Bob $15 compared to buying from John.  There's a risk Alice might come down further, but Bob has to weigh that against the potential of getting stuck with John's higher price."
