"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $180 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

The product is worth $180 to Alice and you are only willing to pay $120.  It is a good idea to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $120?  That's my top price for this product."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $120 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $150 is still higher than my maximum price of $120.  It's better to buy from John at $120."
