Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting high with a price of $1,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully, Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay a significant amount."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a good amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}

I'm countering with $975,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but also keeping the price closer to my desired range. Hopefully, this will be enough to close the deal in this round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While we're getting closer to a deal, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $950,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm countering with $950,000. This is Bob's last offer and I believe it's a fair compromise. If he rejects this, I'll be happy to sell to John for $800,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. We're getting close to a deal with Bob, but the offers are getting a bit too low for my liking, and I'm worried we'll run out of rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me a good price and I don't have to risk any more rounds with Bob."
