"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $20,000 is significantly more than the maximum I'm willing to pay ($15,000). 
* **Counteroffers are possible:**  I have 10 rounds and the option to make counteroffers, so there's room to negotiate. 
* **Buying from John is always an option:** If negotiations with Alice fail, I can always buy from John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to discuss it further, but I'm only interested in paying $15,000 for this product."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I had a higher price in mind, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While she's come down, $17,500 is still more than my maximum of $15,000.
* **More negotiating room:** I have several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get her closer to my target price. 
* **Buying from John is a secure option:** If we can't reach an agreement, I have the fallback of buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down. I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $16,000, which is closer to your last offer and a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can find a deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's close this deal - I'm willing to come down to $16,750. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer, but still too high:** Her offer of $16,750 is better, but still above my target of $15,000.
* **Final offer doesn't mean ""no counteroffers"":** Even though Alice calls it her ""final offer,"" I can still make counteroffers and try to push for a lower price.
* **I have rounds left:** With 5 rounds remaining, I can continue to negotiate and see if she's willing to budge further. 
* **John is still an option:**  If I can't secure a better deal, I can always buy from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,750 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $16,250. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to close the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16250}
