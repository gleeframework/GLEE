"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I had a higher price in mind, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down. I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $16,000, which is closer to your last offer and a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can find a deal.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's close this deal - I'm willing to come down to $16,750. This is my final offer.",16750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,750 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $16,250. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to close the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",16250.0,Bob,6,
