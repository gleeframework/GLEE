"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. It's likely Alice will accept a counteroffer closer to the middle ground.  It's better to try to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John at full price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $800000 is a good offer, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer. While I'd still prefer a lower price, accepting her offer at $950,000 saves me $250,000 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
