,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is far too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $8,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This product truly delivers exceptional value, and I want to make sure we find a price that reflects that.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in the product, but $17,000 is still well outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $10,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my limits.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's meet in the middle - $14,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of what you're getting.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $14,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my sincere interest in this product.",12000.0,Bob,6,
