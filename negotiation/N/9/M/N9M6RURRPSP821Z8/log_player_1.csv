Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my target price.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $95. I'm thinking $95 is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $95 is getting closer to my target, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm hoping that by continuing to negotiate, I can convince Bob to come up to a price that is more acceptable. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still a bit too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop to $100.  It's a fair price for a product you'll really find useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
