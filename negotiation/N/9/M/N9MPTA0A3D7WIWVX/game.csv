"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your interest in selling the product to me. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than you're willing to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My revised offer is $1,300,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that takes into account the value the product holds for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, your offer of $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction. I'm still committed to finding a price that works for both of us. I'd like to counter with $1,100,000. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a successful transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go as low as $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to discussing the terms of the sale.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
