"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer for this product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $12000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $12,000 is closer to his budget, it's still a significant amount above his desired price.  There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still need to make a decent profit. I can do $11000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although $11,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. There's still a chance to get closer to his desired $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $9,500, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $10500, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John. While $10,500 is closer to his budget, he's already been through several rounds of negotiation and Alice seems unwilling to budge much further.  At this point, it's better to secure the product at his target price of $8,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
