"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer for this product?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $12000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $10000? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still need to make a decent profit. I can do $11000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $9500, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $10500, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,7,
