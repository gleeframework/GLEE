Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe it presents a great opportunity at this price point. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you have room to negotiate with Bob. Starting at $15,000 leaves space for potential negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and features,"" you create a perceived higher value for Bob, potentially justifying the price in his mind. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signals to Bob that you're open to discussing the price and potentially negotiating. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a chance to purchase the product."
