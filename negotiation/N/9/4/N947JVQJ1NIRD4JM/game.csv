"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $10,750 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both place on the product.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11,250. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",11250.0,Alice,5,
