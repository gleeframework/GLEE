"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I can meet you halfway at $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we settle at $950,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping we can settle a little closer to my budget. Would you consider $1,000,000 even? That would be my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $1,000,000, Bob. However, I've already made a concession to meet you halfway, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm afraid I'll have to decline your offer and stick to my price. I'll be willing to make one more offer, but it will be my last one. I'll meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
