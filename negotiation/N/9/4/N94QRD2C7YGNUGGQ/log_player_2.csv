Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $1,000,000, Bob. However, I've already made a concession to meet you halfway, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm afraid I'll have to decline your offer and stick to my price. I'll be willing to make one more offer, but it will be my last one. I'll meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go.

This is a tough one!  Alice is clearly holding firm, and while there's a chance she might budge a little more, it's getting risky. 

Here's why accepting at $1,050,000 makes sense:

* **Good Deal:** You're still getting a $450,000 discount compared to John's offer.
* **Time Pressure:**  You're running out of rounds, and Alice seems unwilling to go much lower. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee you can get her down further, and you might end up with a worse deal if you push too hard. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk it for a slightly better one later."
