"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  I believe it's a win-win opportunity for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible.  Even though Alice is framing it as a win-win, her offer is higher than your maximum budget. You can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, so rejecting Alice's offer is the better choice in this scenario."
