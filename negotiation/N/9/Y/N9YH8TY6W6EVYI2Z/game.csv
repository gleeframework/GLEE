"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still leaves some room for profit for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still too high. I'm willing to go to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still above my budget. I'm offering $1,450,000.  This is a fair price, and it's getting us closer to a deal. Let's try to find common ground and get this done.",1450000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm ready to come down to $1,525,000. This offer is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's make this happen.",1525000.0,Alice,7,
