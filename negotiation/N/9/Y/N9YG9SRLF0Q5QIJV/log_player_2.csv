"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. This is a great deal, as you know it's worth $100 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a bit high. While it's true the product is worth $100 to you, you can get it for less from John. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of getting a better deal or sticking with your backup plan."
