# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's a great deal, but it's always worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get an even better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you. What do you think?

Alice's offer is pretty close to my target price, and I don't want to risk her getting upset and rejecting further negotiations.  $875,000 is a good deal, and I'll take it."
