"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is less than Alice's asking price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand your budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13000?  This is still a great deal for you, and it's a price I can live with.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $12,000, it makes the most sense for Bob to buy from John and save $1,000."
