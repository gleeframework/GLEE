Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,500:**  This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value proposition for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than I would like to see if Bob is willing to pay more. However, I'm keeping the price low enough that he might be inclined to accept. If he rejects, I can then lower the price incrementally if necessary, while still keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm not desperate for a sale, and I believe I can potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand your budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000?  This is still a great deal for you, and it's a price I can live with.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000:** This is a compromise price that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and highlighting the value proposition for Bob, emphasizing that this is a fair price for both of us.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise price, I'm showing flexibility while also pushing for a price that's more favorable to me. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this counteroffer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
