,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $140?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer.  However, $110 is still too low for me.  How about we compromise at $130?  This gives us both a fair deal, and I can keep the product moving.",130.0,Alice,5,
