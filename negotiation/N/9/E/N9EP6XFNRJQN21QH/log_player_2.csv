# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

This is a good time to accept the offer.  Alice is signaling that she's firm on her price, and while we could try to negotiate further, we risk her walking away. $1,050,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer."
