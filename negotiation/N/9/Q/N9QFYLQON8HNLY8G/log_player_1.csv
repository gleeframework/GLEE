``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but allows room for negotiation. It's also significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, giving me room to negotiate up if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer, $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll get good value out of the product."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $125.50? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get more than $150 for the product, Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've already rejected two offers, and this one is not significantly better. To guarantee I earn at least my minimum, I'll sell the product to John for $150."
