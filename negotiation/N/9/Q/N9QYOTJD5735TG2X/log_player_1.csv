"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that price. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up.  I'm still confident that I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $10,000. This demonstrates flexibility and shows Bob that I'm open to negotiation. I still believe I can get a higher price, but I want to see if this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a better price, as there are still several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $9,500. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and get a deal done, but I'm still holding firm to a price closer to my desired value."
