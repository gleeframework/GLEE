"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so he should try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and attempt to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount.  This is a starting point for negotiation, and I'm prepared to adjust based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target of $15,000. There's room for further negotiation, and Bob can still try to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

Bob is getting closer to his target price but wants to keep the pressure on Alice.  A counteroffer of $14,000 is still a good deal for Alice, as she values the product at $15,000. This shows Bob's commitment to securing the product at a fair price, while also leaving room for further compromise."
