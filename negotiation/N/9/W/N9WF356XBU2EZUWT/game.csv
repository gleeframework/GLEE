"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $112. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",112.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $112 is closer to where I want to be, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $105.  How about we split the difference at $108.50? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",108.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go as low as $108.50. I'm willing to offer you the product for $114, which is still a great deal considering the value it brings. It's the highest price I'm willing to accept.",114.0,Alice,5,
