You have three options:

You can do better than $110. You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's minimum is $100. There's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $112. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.

You have three options:

Alice is willing to meet you halfway, but you can likely do better.  You are still willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's minimum is $100, so there's still some room for negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $112 is closer to where I want to be, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $105.  How about we split the difference at $108.50? I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 108.50}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go as low as $108.50. I'm willing to offer you the product for $114, which is still a great deal considering the value it brings. It's the highest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $114. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $114
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

```

Alice is sticking to $114. While you could continue to negotiate, it's likely she won't budge further. Buying for $114 is still a better deal than going to John and paying $120."
