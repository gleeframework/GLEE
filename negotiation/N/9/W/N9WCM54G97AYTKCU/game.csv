"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer on the high end, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of my target. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000, but I need to be honest with you, this is my last offer above $950,000. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. While $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to stretch my budget to $975,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $1,000,000, which is $987,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",987500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $987,500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $970,000.  This is a fair price considering we've both moved significantly from our initial positions.",970000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $970,000 is still not enough for me to meet my minimum target. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $990,000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",990000.0,Alice,9,
