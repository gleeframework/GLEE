"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get a better deal than $1,450,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,300,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your initial price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,400,000, which is $1,350,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1,500,000.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
