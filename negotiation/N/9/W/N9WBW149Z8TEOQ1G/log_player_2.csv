Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $775,000. This is my best and final offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $775,000, and it's her ""best and final offer"". Since you can get the product from John for $800,000, it makes more financial sense to buy from John and save the $25,000."
