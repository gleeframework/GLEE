"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, though, and I'm willing to pay $9,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
