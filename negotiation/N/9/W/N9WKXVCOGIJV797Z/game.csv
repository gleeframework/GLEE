"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation for the product. However, I am looking to stay within a budget of $120. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?  This gives you a good price, and I can still make a profit.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $125 for the product?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $125 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's stick with my previous offer of $130. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
