Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This allows for some flexibility in case Bob wants to haggle.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It shows that you're serious about selling, but also willing to work with Bob. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation for the product. However, I am looking to stay within a budget of $120. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?  This gives you a good price, and I can still make a profit."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $125 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite there. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $125 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's stick with my previous offer of $130. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
