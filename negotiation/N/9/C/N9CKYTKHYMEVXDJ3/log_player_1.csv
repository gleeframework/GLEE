"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  Keeping the message friendly and optimistic can encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to negotiating, which can make Bob more willing to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for improvement:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. 
* **Staying firm:**  Rejecting the offer shows I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  By rejecting, I can potentially get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $130 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $135?  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price, but still aiming for a profit.
* **Fairness:**  $135 represents a halfway point between my last offer and Bob's. This shows that I'm taking his counteroffer seriously.
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a positive and open tone can encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is ticking:** We're already four rounds in, and the negotiation is not progressing quickly. 
* **Near my minimum:** While $130 is my absolute minimum, it's still a decent profit, and it's likely Bob won't budge further.
* **Risk of losing a sale:** If I reject again, there's a risk that Bob will lose interest or that John might make a better offer."
