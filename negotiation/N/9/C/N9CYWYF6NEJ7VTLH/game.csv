"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is still a fair price considering the potential value.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value beyond the $950,000 mark. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. This price is fair considering the potential value and allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Bob,4,
