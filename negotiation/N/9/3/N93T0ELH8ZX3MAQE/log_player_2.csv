"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $15,000. You can reject the offer and still secure the product from John, albeit at a higher price."
