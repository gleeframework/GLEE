,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in your product, but I can only go up to $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $110 is still a little out of my price range. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  Let's close this deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $107.50. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",107.5,Alice,5,
