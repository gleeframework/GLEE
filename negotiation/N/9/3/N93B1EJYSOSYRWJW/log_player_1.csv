Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. If Bob rejects, I can then gauge his interest and potentially adjust my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and is closer to my initial asking price of $100. Accepting his offer allows me to secure a good deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or even a failed sale."
