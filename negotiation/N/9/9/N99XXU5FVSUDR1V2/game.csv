"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $120? It's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet at $118, which is a fair compromise.  What do you say?",118.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $118 is the best deal. I'd be willing to pay $112 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?,112.0,Bob,6,
