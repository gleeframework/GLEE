Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm starting with a high offer, considering the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still earning significantly more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a reasonable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly higher than what John is offering. It's a good compromise that ensures a decent profit, so I'll accept."
