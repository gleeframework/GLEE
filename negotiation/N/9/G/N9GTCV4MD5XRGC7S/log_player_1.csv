"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $13,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round.  While $11,500 is better than nothing, I can likely get closer to my desired price of $12,000 by continuing negotiations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
