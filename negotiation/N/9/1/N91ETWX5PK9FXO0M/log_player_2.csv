"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $10,000. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less.  How about $9,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $10,500, which is still a good deal for Bob compared to John's offer of $12,000.  There's not much more room for negotiation, and Bob should accept this offer to secure a good price and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice potentially leading to a higher price or a stalemate."
