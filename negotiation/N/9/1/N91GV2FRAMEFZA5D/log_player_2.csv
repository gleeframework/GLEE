Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $137.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While you can continue negotiating,  you're approaching the price from John.  $137.50 is a reasonable price and allows you to save money compared to buying from John. It's best to accept the offer to secure the deal."
