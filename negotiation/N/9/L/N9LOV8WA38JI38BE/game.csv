"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $9,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is too high for me. This product fits a very specific need, and my budget for it is limited. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $6,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $8,000. This is my lowest price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",8000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $8,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget constraints.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget, Bob. However, I'm still a bit concerned that $7,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but that price point is still outside my budget. To be completely transparent, I've got another offer for a similar product at $10,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I'm only prepared to go as high as $7,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you've got another option on the table, Bob, but I'm still confident that our product is the best choice for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $8,250. This is my last compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",8250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but that final gap is proving tough to bridge. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,750 as a final gesture. However, I need to be upfront â€“ if we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to go with the other offer.  It's a shame to walk away after all this, but I have a budget I need to stick to.",7750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a final push, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $8,000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm hoping we can conclude the deal.",8000.0,Alice,9,
