"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  How about $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $105. Let's try to make this happen.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $107.50 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  Would you consider $106? That's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",106.0,Bob,6,
