"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is better than buying from John for $12,000.  Even though Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, getting the product for $11,500 saves him $500."
