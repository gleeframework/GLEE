"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value you place on the product and our current market conditions, I am proposing a revised price of $900,000 for the product.

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair offer that considers your needs and allows me to stay within my limits.  I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement on this.",875000.0,Bob,4,
