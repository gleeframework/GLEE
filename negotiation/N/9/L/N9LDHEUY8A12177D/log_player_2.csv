"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties to collaborate. We are offering the product for $1,200,000. We understand its value to you is $800,000, but we hope this price aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your target.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value you place on the product and our current market conditions, I am proposing a revised price of $900,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our initial offers and provides a reasonable profit margin for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer, but $900,000 is still too high. We can likely squeeze a bit more out of the deal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair offer that considers your needs and allows me to stay within my limits.  I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued engagement, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. In light of our previous discussions and considering the value of the product to you, I am proposing a final offer of $890,000 for the product. This price aims to be mutually beneficial while respecting the value you place on the item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000

Alice has come down significantly, and $890,000 is within the range of what you are willing to pay.  Accepting the offer avoids further negotiation and ensures you get the product. You're still saving a considerable amount compared to Alice's initial price."
