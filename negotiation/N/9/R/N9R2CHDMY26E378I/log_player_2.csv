Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $7,250? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $7,250 is still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price with another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $7,150? It's a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,150

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $7,150 is within my budget and a good deal, considering I can get the product from John for $8,000.  While I'd prefer to pay even less, it's likely I won't be able to negotiate any further.  Accepting this offer will save me $850."
