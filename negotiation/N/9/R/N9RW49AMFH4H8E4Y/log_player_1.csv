Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,450,000) creates a sense of urgency and value. It's a substantial profit margin while still being appealing to Bob, who values it at $1,000,000.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:**  By framing the offer as time-sensitive and mentioning ""other interested parties,"" we increase the perceived value and encourage Bob to act quickly."
