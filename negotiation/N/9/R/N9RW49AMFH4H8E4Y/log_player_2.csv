"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.

Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and purchase from John to save a significant amount of money."
