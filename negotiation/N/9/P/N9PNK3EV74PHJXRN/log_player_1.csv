``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me, aiming for a good starting point for negotiation. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, ensuring I don't go too low."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $750,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.
