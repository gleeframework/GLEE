"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1300000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,300,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  There's no reason to accept a worse deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1150000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,250,000 is closer to his ideal price, he can still get the product for less from John. He can try to negotiate further with Alice, or simply go with the safer option of buying from John."
