"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me, and it allows us both to make a deal.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $850,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this deal work for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $875,000.  This would allow us both to come away with a good outcome.  What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
