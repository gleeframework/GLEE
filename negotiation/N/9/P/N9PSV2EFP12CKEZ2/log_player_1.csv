Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** By starting at $900,000, I can potentially accept a counteroffer that's closer to his value without dropping below my desired minimum.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language to emphasize the value of the product and build a rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me, and it allows us both to make a deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer is still above my minimum of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further. 
* **Opportunity for Counter:** I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John at this point would mean leaving money on the table, as Bob's offer is closer to my ideal outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $850,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this deal work for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $875,000.  This would allow us both to come away with a good outcome.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Middle:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my desired minimum. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fair Compromise:** $875,000 feels like a reasonable compromise, and I'm using language to frame it as a ""good outcome"" for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to keep negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Near Minimum:** Bob is now firmly at $850,000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a deadlock, wasting time.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, ensuring a good outcome. 

I'm willing to accept some loss of potential profit for the sake of certainty and efficiency."
