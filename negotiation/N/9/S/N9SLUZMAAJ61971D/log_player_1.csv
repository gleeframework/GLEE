Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $700,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:

While $775,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that I can sell to John for $800,000, so that's what I'll do."
