"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product has value, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, the product's true worth is reflected in its potential to generate significant returns. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,750,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to see a price closer to $1,350,000 to make this work. What do you say?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This offer reflects my best effort to make this deal work while ensuring a fair price for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your adjustments.  However, to be frank,  $1,600,000 is really pushing my absolute limit.  How about we settle at $1,425,000 and call it a deal?  This offer demonstrates my strong interest in the product while respecting your need for a fair price.",1425000.0,Bob,6,
