Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product and the potential return on investment it offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway and bring the price down to $1,800,000.  This feels like a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has potential, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can get closer to $1,700,000 before considering John's offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1,650,000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}

**Reasoning:**  While it's slightly under my ideal target, Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is a reasonable compromise. Accepting now ensures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further lowballing in subsequent rounds."
