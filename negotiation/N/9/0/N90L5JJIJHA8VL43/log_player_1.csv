"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $120 initially leaves room for negotiation while still allowing me to earn significantly more than my minimum.
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob reinforces the idea of a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message expresses willingness to negotiate, inviting Bob to engage further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $90 is better than selling to John, Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to pay more. Rejecting this offer allows for further negotiation.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer keeps me in control and demonstrates my willingness to hold out for a better price.
* **Room for Counteroffers:**  I have several rounds left, giving me the opportunity to  propose a counteroffer closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $105? That would still give you a great deal on this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but not cave to Bob's initial low offer.  A $105 price is a reasonable compromise.
* **Reiterate Value:**  Again, emphasizing the product's worth reinforces the idea of a fair deal.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:**  Keeping the message friendly helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:**  While $97.50 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still within the realm of potential for a better deal. I'm confident Bob values the product enough to go higher.
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and am confident I can get a better price. 
* **Negotiation Is a Process:**  This negotiation is a back-and-forth. I'm willing to continue to see if Bob will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway! Let's split the difference. How about $101.25? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 101.25}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This approach demonstrates flexibility while still moving closer to my desired price point.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:**  Highlighting the deal being ""great for both of us"" encourages a win-win mindset.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  Again, reminding Bob of the product's value reinforces the justification for a slightly higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:**  $100 is just slightly below my ideal price point, but it's a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer and well above my minimum.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  With only four rounds left, it's important to consider the potential risk of further negotiation.  
* **Avoiding John's Offer:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a better price than selling to John. While I could potentially get a higher price from Bob, the risk of failure in the remaining rounds is too high."
