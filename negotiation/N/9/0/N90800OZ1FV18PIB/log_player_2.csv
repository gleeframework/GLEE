"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too close to my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This leaves me room to increase my offer in later rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it still gives you a good deal on a quality product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $130 is still above my target price. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

I'm raising my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm holding firm at my target price. This will hopefully encourage her to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
