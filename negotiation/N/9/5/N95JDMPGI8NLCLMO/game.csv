"Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something I value at least $10,000, and I believe it could be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further. If not, I have another buyer lined up who's happy to pay $10,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,
