{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $140. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale for $100 if Bob declines. 

By offering the product at $140, you are aiming for a price that is:

* **Attractive to Bob:**  He gets a $10 discount from his perceived value.
* **Highly Profitable for You:** You secure a $40 profit margin, which is significantly better than your backup offer from John."
