Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for potential negotiation but still allows me to make a good profit. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this product. It's truly valuable and will be worth every penny for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is still below my initial desired price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and a good compromise.  It's also likely that Bob will be less willing to negotiate further, so accepting his offer is the most sensible option."
