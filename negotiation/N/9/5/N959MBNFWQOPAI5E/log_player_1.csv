"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $2,000,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong opening offer significantly above both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This establishes a firm position and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique"" and ""exclusive"" nature to justify the high price, even though we haven't revealed specifics about the product. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer is a way to gauge Bob's eagerness and flexibility.  His response will reveal how aggressively I need to negotiate in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, your offer is significantly above my budget. Given my research and the product's potential value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is my best offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer is already $200,000 above his own valuation of the product, showing he's willing to negotiate.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We're still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to counter with a price closer to my target. 
* **John as a Backup:** While selling to John is an option, it's still early. I want to explore if I can get a better deal from Bob before resorting to my backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value this product brings to the table is substantial, and my initial price reflects that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,800,000. This offer represents a significant opportunity to acquire an asset of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Meeting Bob ""halfway"" sounds like a significant compromise, but it's actually a calculated move. I'm still well above his offer and slightly closer to my minimum. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message continues to stress the product's exceptional value without revealing specifics, justifying the high price.
* **Pressure Tactic:**  By presenting this offer as a ""significant opportunity,"" I'm subtly suggesting that it's in Bob's best interest to accept before I reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000.  I believe this price reflects the product's value to me and is a fair compromise.  Let's try to find common ground and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Outcome:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly above his initial offer and a substantial profit for me. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could push for a higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away. Accepting now secures a favorable deal. 
* **Time Value:** Prolonging negotiations with Bob has diminishing returns. Accepting now allows me to move on to other potential deals."
