The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it is lower than her first offer, it's still above Bob's value. It makes sense to continue negotiating and try to get closer to his target price."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his value. It's worth continuing to negotiate, potentially with a counteroffer closer to $12,000, to see if Alice will come down further."

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob has reached his maximum value for the product and should accept John's offer to avoid paying more."
