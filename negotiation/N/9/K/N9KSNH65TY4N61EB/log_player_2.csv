"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 feels fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. As Bob, I aim to get the best price possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the $950,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000.  This is a very competitive price considering the potential returns you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but it's still above my ideal target. I can still negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to $950,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a more favorable price before I have to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $987,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 987500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While I value meeting in the middle, this product has significant upside potential that I need to factor in. My final offer is $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's value while still providing you with substantial profit potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,000,000, which is still more than my initial counteroffer but within my acceptable range.  I've got 5 rounds left and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get Alice any lower. It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk having to buy from John at a higher price."
