"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 feels fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the $950,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000.  This is a very competitive price considering the potential returns you'll see.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $987,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While I value meeting in the middle, this product has significant upside potential that I need to factor in. My final offer is $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's value while still providing you with substantial profit potential.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
