"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately $1500000 is below my minimum selling point.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm prepared to come down to $1750000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it still offers you a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I must respectfully decline at $1750000. Given my current financial situation, I am looking to keep the cost under $1600000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1550000. I hope this proposal is within your consideration.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1550000 is still slightly below my minimum.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to drop my price to $1600000. This is my final offer. I believe this price is a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I've reviewed our discussions and while I'm appreciative of your efforts, I must decline at $1600000. My budgetary constraints necessitate a price closer to $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1525000. I hope this proposal will be considered favorably.",1525000.0,Bob,6,
