"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to meet me closer to my valuation.  This product is a game-changer, and $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth.  My final offer is $1,225,000.  This is a very reasonable compromise, and I believe it's in your best interest to accept.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
