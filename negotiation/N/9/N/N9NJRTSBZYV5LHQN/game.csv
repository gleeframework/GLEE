"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $90. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $130. How about we meet at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $110. How about we meet at $125? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm still making a profit.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $115. Can you meet me there?",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $115. I'll make one more counteroffer, but I need to make a profit, so let's try $127.50. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time.",127.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $127.50. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not comfortable going above $110. I'm willing to meet you at $117.50, but that's my final offer. If you can't meet me there, I'll have to walk away and buy from John for $100.",117.5,Bob,8,
