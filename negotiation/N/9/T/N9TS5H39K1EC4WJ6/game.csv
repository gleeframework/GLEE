"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. While I see the potential in this product, I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. I'm confident this price reflects the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $2,000,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my acceptable range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $800,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair transaction for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement with some further compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000, but that's my final offer.  This is a significant investment for you, I understand, but it reflects the true potential and return you'll gain. Let's close this deal - are you in?",1800000.0,Alice,5,
