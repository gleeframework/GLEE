"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 12000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a good distance from my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see value in the product and be willing to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round. I'll use this opportunity to send a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is still a fair bit less than my minimum but is a good compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate. I hope Bob will see this as a good deal and accept, but I'm still open to further negotiations if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, even though it's an increase. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I believe I can get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to bridge the gap between our valuations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to drop my price to $10,500. This is a significant compromise, but I still believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and finally accept. We are getting closer to an agreement and I want to avoid selling to John just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob and I seem to be stuck in a negotiation loop.  His offer is still significantly below my minimum price, and I'm hesitant to keep going back and forth without any real progress. While I'd prefer to earn more, the potential of losing more rounds and missing out on a guaranteed $15,000 from John is too risky.  I'm going to sell to John."
