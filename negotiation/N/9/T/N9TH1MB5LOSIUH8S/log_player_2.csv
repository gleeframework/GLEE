"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your maximum budget and her own valuation. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price down significantly while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $12,000 is still a ways away from your target price. It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that price work for you?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

This counter-offer moves closer to the middle ground while still leaving room for Alice to make a profit."
