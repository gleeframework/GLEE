Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. This gives him room to negotiate while still allowing me to earn a decent profit.
* **Target:** My ideal outcome is to sell the product for at least $1,500,000, but I need to be realistic and understand Bob's potential counteroffers. 
* **John as a safety net:** I'm aware of John's offer, which serves as a safety net, allowing me to walk away from the negotiation if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than my desired price. 
* **Negotiation:** While I need to be flexible, accepting his offer now would result in a significant loss compared to what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to engage in further negotiation.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 remains a viable alternative. This allows me to maintain a strong bargaining position. 

I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving slightly closer to Bob's price while still maintaining a reasonable profit for me.
* **Maintaining Position:**  It's important to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to make a deal at any cost.
* **Avoiding John:** I'm still hoping to reach an agreement with Bob, as selling to John would be the easiest option but might not maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe $1,175,000 is still quite high for me. I am willing to go up to $1,150,000 for the product. I hope this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still $350,000 less than my minimum desired price.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Further negotiation with Bob might result in a lower final price, potentially leading to a bigger loss.
* **John's Guarantee:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. This eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob and ensures a profitable outcome.

Given the current situation, the most logical and financially sound decision is to sell the product to John."
