"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I think it's worth $120, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still within a range that's potentially acceptable.  I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and show flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price, and I'm not willing to sell at such a low price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $97.50?  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 97.50}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering a price slightly closer to his offer while still remaining above my minimum threshold.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $97.5 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $91?  I'm really keen on buying this product, but that's my absolute maximum. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $91 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not quite there. I'm willing to continue negotiating with him, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit away from your offer, but I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum. I'm also highlighting the benefits of the deal for Bob to encourage him to accept."
