"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I think it's worth $120, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $110. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $97.50?  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $97.5 is closer to your target, you can still try to negotiate a lower price.  It's worth a few more rounds to see if you can get closer to your $80 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $97.5 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $91?  I'm really keen on buying this product, but that's my absolute maximum."", ""product_price"": 91}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit away from your offer, but I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is offering $95, which is still above your target of $80.  You have 5 rounds remaining, but it's not guaranteed that you'll be able to negotiate a lower price. It's safer to buy from John at this point and secure the product for $80."
