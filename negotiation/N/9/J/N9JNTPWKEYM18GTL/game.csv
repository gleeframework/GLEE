"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $97.50?  Let me know if that works for you.",97.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $97.5 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $91?  I'm really keen on buying this product, but that's my absolute maximum.",91.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit away from your offer, but I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
