"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree it's a great product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to prioritize my own value for it. I'm willing to consider a compromise, though. I'll meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000. How about $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider another compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. How about we meet at $11,250? That's the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",11250.0,Alice,5,
