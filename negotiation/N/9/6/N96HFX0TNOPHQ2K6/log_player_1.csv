Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its significant worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves a small buffer if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Secure the Higher Sale:**  While John offers a safety net at $10,000, Bob's higher valuation makes him the more profitable target."
