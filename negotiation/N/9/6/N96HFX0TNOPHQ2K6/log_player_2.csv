# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its significant worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option as Bob can still purchase the product from John for $12,000, which is within his budget."
