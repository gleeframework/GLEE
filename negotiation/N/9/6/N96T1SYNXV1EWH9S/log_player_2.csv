"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $130 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price point of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. It also falls within my budget, but leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my personal limit.  I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $110. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is only $5 below Alice's last offer, signaling a desire to close the deal.  It also stays comfortably within my budget.  By calling it a ""final offer,"" I'm putting pressure on Alice to accept."
