"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10,500 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750? Can we agree on that price?",9750.0,Bob,4,
