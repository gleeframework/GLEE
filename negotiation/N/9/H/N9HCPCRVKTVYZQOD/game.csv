,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still leaves room for a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go. Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it represents a good compromise for both of us. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're still looking for a higher price, but $925,000 is pushing my budget. I'm willing to go up to $910,000. This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal now.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $910,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to meet you at $915,000.  This is a very small difference, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",915000.0,Alice,7,
