"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but still lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Mutual Benefit:** Highlighting the ""great deal"" for both parties can make Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for such a low offer this early in the process.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still leaves room for a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price but still allows for further negotiation.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm explaining the reasoning behind my counteroffer, showing that I'm taking Bob's perspective into account.
* **Collaborative Tone:** I'm emphasizing finding a solution that works for everyone,  creating a more collaborative and less adversarial atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. There are still 6 rounds left and I'm not desperate to sell right now. I will counteroffer again, trying to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it represents a good compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Compromise:** Emphasizing the price as a ""compromise"" positions it as a fair solution for both parties.
* **Fairness:** I'm reinforcing the idea of a fair price, making the offer more appealing.
* **Urgency:**  Asking for a decision with ""What do you say?"" subtly increases the pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're still looking for a higher price, but $925,000 is pushing my budget. I'm willing to go up to $910,000. This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable accepting $910,000. There are still 4 rounds left, and I can potentially get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer once more, hoping to reach a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $910,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to meet you at $915,000.  This is a very small difference, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 915000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Difference:** Emphasizing the small difference between my counteroffer and Bob's last offer makes it seem like a minor hurdle to overcome.
* **Fair Compromise:**  Reiterating the idea of a fair compromise positions my offer as a reasonable solution.
* **Finality:**  Stating ""Let's finalize this deal"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept."
