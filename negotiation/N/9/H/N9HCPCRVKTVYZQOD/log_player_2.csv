"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still leaves room for a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it represents a good compromise for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're still looking for a higher price, but $925,000 is pushing my budget. I'm willing to go up to $910,000. This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal now."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $910,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to meet you at $915,000.  This is a very small difference, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**  Alice is now offering $915,000. This is very close to Bob's budget, but it's still a bit high. It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000, saving him $115,000. It's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a better price from Alice."
