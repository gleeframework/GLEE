"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to me. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable with my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,000? This would still leave me with a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not able to go lower than $13,500. This price reflects the true value of the product, and it's a fair compromise considering our previous offers. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to get a fair price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,500. I'm willing to go up to $12,800, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",12800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see you're getting closer to my desired price point.  However, $12,800 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference and aim for $13,100.  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a final agreement.",13100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'm getting close to considering buying from John. I'm willing to meet you at $12,900, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to explore other options.",12900.0,Bob,8,
