Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is only worth $10,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Safety Net:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's appealing to Bob but still gets you closer to your minimum. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have leverage to start higher.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it at $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Value-Focused:** The message is straightforward and highlights the product's ""unique value.""
* **Strong Opening:** The $11,500 price gives you negotiating room.  
* **Time Pressure (Subtle):** Mentioning listing it publicly implies he might miss out if he hesitates.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make $11,500, which is a good deal.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  He might counter-offer, and you can decide if you want to go lower, knowing your minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** No problem! You sell to John for your guaranteed $12,000."
