"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($10,000). This allows for some room to negotiate downwards if necessary. 

I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but I also need to be realistic about the potential for a deal. 

It's important to remember that I don't know the value of the product to Bob, so starting high and allowing for counteroffers gives me flexibility to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. I'm not willing to sell at such a loss.  

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a higher price. This will give me a chance to try and get closer to my desired selling price. I still have 8 more rounds to reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum value. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept. 

If he doesn't, I can still adjust my offer in the next round based on his response and how many rounds I have left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum value of $10,000.  While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum.  

I'm going to reject this offer and counter again, hoping to inch closer to a price that works for both of us.  I still have 6 rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for less than $10,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to negotiate with Bob, but I'm also aware that time is running out.  I'm dropping my offer to $11,000, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's latest offer. This shows good faith and a willingness to compromise.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round, as I'm running out of time to get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum value of $10,000. I've already made several concessions, and with only four rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that I'll be able to reach a deal with Bob that meets my minimum. 

At this point, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John for $10,000, which is exactly my minimum value. This guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob that might lead to a lower price or no deal at all."
