The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and she's offering $1,300,000. This leaves a lot of room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice is coming down, but I'm still willing to gamble a bit more. I'll counter with a lower offer to see if we can get closer to my target."
