"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $175 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be happy to pay $130 for the product. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $155, which is a great compromise. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $155 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $152, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",152.0,Alice,5,
