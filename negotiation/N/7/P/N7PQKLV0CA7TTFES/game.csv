"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering your offer of $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $15,000. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. While $15,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $13,500?  I believe that's a fair offer.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,500. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to compromise again. I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,5,
