# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer. "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to your desired price, it's still a bit higher than your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get Alice to drop the price even more."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering it's in the middle of our last two offers.  I believe this is a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but $9,250 is still more than you're willing to pay.  You have a guaranteed alternative with John that is within your budget.  It's best to take the sure thing."
