"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer. ",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering it's in the middle of our last two offers.  I believe this is a good deal for both of us. ",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",9250.0,Alice,5,
