"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
