"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  If that fails, Bob can always buy from John for $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's not the absolute lowest price, $1,150,000 is still within his budget and better than what John is offering.  There's no guarantee that he can negotiate further and get a lower price from Alice, and risking that could cost him the chance to buy from John as well."
