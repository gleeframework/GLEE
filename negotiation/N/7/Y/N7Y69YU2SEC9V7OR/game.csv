"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm confident it's worth at least $20,000 in value you'll receive from it. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you at $19,000. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However,  $19,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for it.  What do you think?",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for it. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $17,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",16500.0,Bob,4,
