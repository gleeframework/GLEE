"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Buying from John is still cheaper:** While John's offer is also close to your limit, it's still $100,000 cheaper than Alice's. 

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most financially advantageous choice in this scenario."
