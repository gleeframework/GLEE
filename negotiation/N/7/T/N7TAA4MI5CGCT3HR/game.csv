"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $1200000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to consider a price of $900000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $900000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns on investment. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1050000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still hoping to land a deal closer to $1000000. I'm offering $1025000, which is a significant step towards meeting you halfway. Let's see if we can finalize this.",1025000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm at a point where I need to be more realistic about the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at the minimum price I'm willing to accept, which is $1000000. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1000000.0,Alice,5,,
