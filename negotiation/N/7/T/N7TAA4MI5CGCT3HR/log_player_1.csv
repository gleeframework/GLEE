Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $1200000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to consider a price of $900000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is lower than my initial offer of $1,200,000, but higher than the minimum value of the product to me ($1,000,000), I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $900,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than that, but lower than my initial offer of $1,200,000. I'll aim for a price that's closer to the product's minimum value to me, but still leaves room for negotiation.

{""message"": ""I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1050000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still hoping to land a deal closer to $1000000. I'm offering $1025000, which is a significant step towards meeting you halfway. Let's see if we can finalize this.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $1,025,000 and my minimum value is $1,000,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's exactly at my minimum value. This is a firm price, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it.
