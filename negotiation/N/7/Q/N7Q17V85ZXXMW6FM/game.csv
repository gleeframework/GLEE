"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  It's incredibly valuable, and I believe it would be a significant asset to you.  Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product is valuable, that asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start negotiations at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation.  While $600,000 is too low for this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to find common ground. This is a significant reduction and reflects my eagerness to make a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on your price, but that's still a bit too rich for my blood.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers, say $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. How about we settle at $1,150,000? This represents a significant compromise from my original position and brings us closer to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  I appreciate the concessions you've made so far.  To meet you halfway, I could do $1,025,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
