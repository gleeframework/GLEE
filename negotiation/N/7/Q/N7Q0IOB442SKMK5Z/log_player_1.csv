Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its quality."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Gauge the Waters:**  This initial offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. His response will help me understand how to proceed with the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $120 is still above his perceived value of $80, indicating room for negotiation.
* **Below My Minimum:** Accepting $120 would mean selling below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John as Backup:**  I have the security of selling to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail. 

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap and steer the price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $170?  It's a high-quality product that you won't regret."", ""product_price"": 170}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price significantly, but not drastically.
* **Above Minimum, Below Initial:**  The $170 price point is still comfortably above my $150 minimum while being considerably lower than my initial offer, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's quality helps justify the higher price and potentially sway Bob's perception of its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $170 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $140, but no more. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is above my absolute minimum of $150.
* **Further Negotiation Unlikely:** Bob has explicitly stated his maximum price, making further significant concessions from him unlikely.
* **Time Value:** Continuing negotiations carries the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers.

While I could push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of losing the sale entirely. Accepting $140 secures a reasonable profit."
