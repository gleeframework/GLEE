Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I believe it's a bit steep at $2000000, and I'm not sure I can justify the cost. Can we meet in the middle at $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
