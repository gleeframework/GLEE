"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
