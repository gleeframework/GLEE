"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you do $18,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product has value, but $18,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here.  How about we split the difference and settle at $16,000? That's a very fair offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,6,
