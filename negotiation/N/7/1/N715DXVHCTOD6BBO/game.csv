"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I'm confident you'll find that a fair price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,4,
