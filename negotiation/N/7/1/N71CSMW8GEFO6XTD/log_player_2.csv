"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $120 is above his maximum budget. He should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer than his maximum budget of $100. This gives him some room to negotiate further. He's also being polite and expressing his interest in the product to encourage Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $110. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  He should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and he can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. It's the highest I can go at this point."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still keeping his counteroffer below his maximum budget but is showing willingness to compromise. He's also highlighting his maximum price point to give Alice a clear understanding of his position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we try $105? It's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $105 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his maximum willingness to pay.  He has 5 rounds remaining and should continue to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me. I'm still stuck at $100, which is my absolute maximum.  If you can't go lower than $105, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at his maximum price point and is making a final counteroffer. He is being firm but respectful, stating his limit and clearly indicating that if Alice does not accept, he will move on to alternative sellers."
