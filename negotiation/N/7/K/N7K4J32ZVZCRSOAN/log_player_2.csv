"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than $150, you can likely do better. You're willing to pay up to $150, so there's room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $120 but still above her minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing me to save a significant amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is a good compromise. It's lower than her previous offer and closer to my desired price point. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she might reject my counteroffer and I'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price without risking a worse outcome."
