Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm happy to accept $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest in the product, $950,000 is still below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to get a fair deal. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
