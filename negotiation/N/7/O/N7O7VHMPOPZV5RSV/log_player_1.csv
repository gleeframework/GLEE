I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my desired price.  I'm still not comfortable with $87, so I'll make one more counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $87 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's try $89. This is a fair price that's still a good value for you."", ""product_price"": 89}

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $88.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit for me and  better than selling to John for $80. I'm also running out of time with only 4 rounds left."
