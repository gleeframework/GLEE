"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you at $9,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
