"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than the product's worth to her, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my budget. While it's a significant decrease from her initial offer, I can still potentially negotiate a better price or simply buy from John for $8,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you at $9,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly in price, $9,250 is still above my budget.  I can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it makes more sense to go with that option and avoid further negotiation."
