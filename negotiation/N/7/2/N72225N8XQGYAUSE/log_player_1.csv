Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit while still keeping Bob interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. I'm willing to risk a further round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm countering with $10,500.  This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer and closer to my desired value. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable compromise for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable value. Even though it's still possible to counteroffer, I've reached a point where I feel it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John is offering a guaranteed $10,000, which meets my minimum requirement. I'm going to sell the product to John."
