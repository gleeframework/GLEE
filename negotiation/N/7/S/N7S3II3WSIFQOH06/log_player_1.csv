Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $20,000 gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn a good profit.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly and confident tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** Mentioning the product's value to Bob makes him consider its potential worth to him.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This approach allows me to assess Bob's interest and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I can move on to John for the minimum $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $12000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  $15,000 is my absolute minimum, and Bob is willing to pay that.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:** There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob, and I risk losing time and potentially losing the sale altogether.
* **Selling to John is the same:** John is also willing to pay $15,000, so accepting Bob's offer achieves the same financial outcome. 

Since my goal is to maximize profit, accepting Bob's offer is the most rational decision."
