Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** $1,500,000 (the minimum you'll accept)
* **Bob's Valuation:** $1,200,000
* **John's Valuation:** $1,500,000 (your guaranteed backup)

**Strategy:**

You have a strong position because John provides a guaranteed sale at your reservation price. This allows you to push for a higher price with Bob. However, you need to leave Bob with enough potential profit to make accepting your offer worthwhile.

**The Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a competitive offer considering its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  The message emphasizes the product's value but avoids being overly aggressive. 
* **Price:**  $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to make a potential profit of $150,000 if he can maximize the product's value. 

**Why this approach?**

This offer aims to strike a balance:

* **Maximize Your Profit:**  It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to get you closer to your reservation price.
* **Keep Bob Interested:** The potential $150,000 profit provides an incentive for Bob to seriously consider the offer.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. If he does, you have the security of John's offer to fall back on."
