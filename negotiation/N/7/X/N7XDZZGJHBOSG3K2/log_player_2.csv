"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's offer of $110 is better than her product's worth to her ($120), you know you can get a better deal from John for $100."
