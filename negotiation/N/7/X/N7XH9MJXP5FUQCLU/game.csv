"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is quite high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle somewhat?  Would you be willing to go up to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to go to $950,000. This represents a significant step closer to your position, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
