Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle somewhat?  Would you be willing to go up to $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to go to $950,000. This represents a significant step closer to your position, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum threshold. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
