"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and significantly more than what I'd get from selling it to someone else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'd be willing to pay $900000 for the product. It's still a great deal for me, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. I'd be willing to pay $950000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
