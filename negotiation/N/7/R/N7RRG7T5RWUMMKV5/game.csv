"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you the product for $9,800. This is a good balance between what I'm willing to sell it for and what you're willing to pay. Let me know what you think.",9800.0,Alice,5,
