Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly holding firm around the $11,200 mark.  While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, the difference is getting smaller and it's not worth risking the deal entirely. Accepting at $11,200 secures a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John for $15,000."
