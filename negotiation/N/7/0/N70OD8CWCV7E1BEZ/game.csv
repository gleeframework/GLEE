"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $95? ",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider it. How about I meet you at $105? It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
