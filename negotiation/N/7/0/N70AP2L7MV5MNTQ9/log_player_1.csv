{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. That's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth at least $8,000 to me. Bob's offer is lower, so I'll reject it for now and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $7,500 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of this incredible product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $8,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. I'd rather not risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate, especially since John is also willing to buy for the same price."
