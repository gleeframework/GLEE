"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $140 is better than John's $120, but we might get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Open:** The tone remains friendly and expresses interest, which is important for successful negotiation. 
* **Strategic Goal:** My ideal outcome is to pay somewhere between $100 and $120. This counteroffer sets the stage for that possibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice met our ideal price! There's no point in rejecting and potentially losing the deal. We're getting the product at the same price as John, so we might as well buy it from Alice."
