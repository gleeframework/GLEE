Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $19,000 offer leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can gradually lower the price, potentially settling somewhere above your minimum. 
* **Gauging Interest:** The message also aims to gauge Bob's interest level. If he's completely turned off by the price, you know to move on to John quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Keep in mind that Bob might try to negotiate you down knowing you have a guaranteed buyer.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower offer from Bob instead of waiting for John."
