Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its worth while leaving room for a beneficial discussion. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value to give myself room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value being higher than Bob's estimation, potentially influencing his perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to encourage Bob to engage in a back-and-forth discussion.
* **Safety Net:**  I have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more significant reduction in price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth and the market value. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer is still significantly above his perceived value of the product ($800,000). This indicates there's room for further negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:** While Bob's offer is a substantial jump from his perceived value, I started high, leaving space for me to make a counteroffer that moves us closer to a mutually beneficial price. 
* **John as Leverage:**  The guarantee of selling to John for $1,200,000 gives me a strong position. I'm not pressured to accept an offer below my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I recognize you're looking for a significant discount, my initial price reflected the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession of $50,000 to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, this keeps me well above his perceived value and closer to my target.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly reiterates the product's high value to justify the smaller price reduction.
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""considerable compromise"" and ""fair deal"" aims to create a sense of reciprocity and encourage Bob to move closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value you're trying to convey. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is significantly higher than his initial offer and a substantial profit over his perceived value of the product. It's also comfortably above my absolute minimum.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, the potential gains are minimal compared to the risk of Bob walking away. Negotiations have reached a point of diminishing returns.
* **Secure the Sale:** Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation or the need to find another buyer."
