"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,800,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer you a compromise at $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping for a better deal. How about $1,400,000? This would be a significant saving for me while still allowing you a profit above your value for the product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $1,550,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
