{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget.** This is a good starting point for negotiation.
* **I want to see if I can get an even better price.**  There's no reason to jump at the first offer, especially when I have a backup option. 
* **By rejecting, I signal my willingness to negotiate.** This gives me more leverage in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  I'm starting with a significant drop from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and puts pressure on Alice.
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** While $700,000 is a big drop, it's still within a range that Alice might consider, especially since she likely wants to sell the product.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and gives me a better understanding of her bottom line."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down, but still not at my ideal price:** While $750,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still above my desired price point.
* **More room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for me to push for a lower price, especially since Alice rejected my counteroffer.
* **I want to see how far I can get:** I'm determined to save as much as possible, so I'm going to continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm moving closer to Alice's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still pursuing a better price.
* **Testing the Limits:**  $725,000 is a reasonable middle ground. It's a small increase from my previous offer but still keeps me within a comfortable range.
* **Closing the Gap:**  This counteroffer is designed to gauge if we can reach an agreement this round. If Alice accepts, great! If not, I'm prepared to continue negotiations."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer, but still not close enough:**  While $740,000 is a good deal compared to her initial offer, it's still a bit higher than where I want to be.
* **More negotiation rounds:** With several rounds remaining, there's no reason to settle yet. I want to see if I can get Alice down to my target price.
* **Potential for compromise:**  Alice's offer is a signal that she's willing to compromise.  By continuing to negotiate, I might be able to find a mutually agreeable price point."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 730000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining leverage. It's a small increase from my previous offer, indicating that I'm getting closer to Alice's position.
* **Testing the Waters:** By offering $730,000, I'm trying to see if we can find a middle ground. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With rounds decreasing, this counteroffer is meant to gauge if Alice is serious about closing a deal. If she rejects, I'll need to reassess the situation."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $735,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $735,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Alice's offer is only $5,000 higher than my last counteroffer, indicating we're very close to an agreement.
* **Time Pressure:** With only three rounds remaining, it's becoming risky to continue rejecting offers. 
* **Acceptable Price:** $735,000 is a significant saving compared to John's price and is within a reasonable range for me. 

Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of running out of rounds."
