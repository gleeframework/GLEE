"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I understand the value of the product, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be open to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
