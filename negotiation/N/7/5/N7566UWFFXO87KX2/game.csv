"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and making a counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider my revised offer?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your revised offer.  However, $10,250 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer a final price of $10,375.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll have to consider selling to John.",10375.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I'm getting close to the point where I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right. I'm willing to meet you at $10,300, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",10300.0,Bob,6,
