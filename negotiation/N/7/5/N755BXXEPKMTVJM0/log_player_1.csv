Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that this product has significant value, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you be willing to consider $1,337,500?

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly holding firm around this price point. Accepting his offer of $1,337,500 is still a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of continued negotiation or losing him as a buyer."
