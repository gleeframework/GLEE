"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum allows room for negotiation and signals the product's importance.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies reasons for the high price without explicitly stating them, leaving room for Bob to engage.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests willingness to discuss further, encouraging Bob to counter-offer rather than walk away immediately.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will reveal how serious and motivated he is.
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:** If Bob is willing to negotiate close to the initial offer, you gain significantly. 
3. **Maintain John as Leverage:** You haven't revealed your guaranteed offer, keeping John as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's crucial to remember you don't *need* to settle for that amount.  There are still several rounds of negotiation left, and Bob jumping straight to your minimum suggests he's willing to go higher. 

By rejecting this offer, you signal that you value the product above $1,500,000, encouraging him to increase his bid in the next round. You still have John's offer as a safety net if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,500,000 is a respectable figure, it doesn't quite reflect the full value of what's being offered.  To move this forward, I'd be willing to consider a price of $1,900,000. This takes into account its potential while acknowledging your initial assessment."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're coming down from the initial offer, but not drastically.  This shows flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Anchoring:** By keeping the price well above both Bob's offer and your minimum, you aim to anchor the negotiation in a higher range.
* **Justification:**  The message provides a reason for the price without revealing too much about your bottom line. 

This approach seeks to:

1. **Encourage a Counter:** The substantial difference between your counteroffer and Bob's offer likely motivates him to negotiate further.
2. **Maintain Momentum:** The back-and-forth exchange keeps the negotiation moving and prevents a stalemate. 
3. **Leave Room for Compromise:**  There's space for you to gradually lower the price in subsequent rounds if needed, while still aiming for a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's motivated.  However, his current offer is still significantly below your aspirational price point. You have time and leverage on your side:

* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is moving in the right direction, suggesting he's willing to pay more than his initial offer. 
* **John's Offer:** Your guaranteed offer from John acts as a strong safety net. You don't need to rush into accepting anything below a desirable amount.
* **Rounds Remaining:** With several rounds left, you have room to negotiate further. A rejection keeps the pressure on Bob to improve his offer.

By rejecting, you signal that  $1,600,000 is still too low, encouraging Bob to propose something closer to your target range in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while acknowledging your position."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:** This offer signals you're serious about closing the deal.  The substantial drop from $1,900,000 shows flexibility. 
* **Midpoint:** This price sits almost exactly between your last offer and Bob's last offer, making it a strong psychological anchor for agreement.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By framing this as a final compromise, you subtly introduce a sense of urgency without issuing an ultimatum.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Encourage Acceptance:** The attractive price and your willingness to compromise increase the likelihood of Bob accepting.
2. **Maintain Profit Margin:** While lower than your initial goal, $1,750,000 is still a significant profit above your minimum and John's offer.
3. **Avoid Stalemate:**  The offer prevents the negotiation from stalling while keeping the power in your hands for the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit concerned about the cost. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal. Here's why:

* **Profitable Offer:** $1,550,000 is above your minimum acceptable price and a significant gain over John's offer. 
* **Negotiating Pattern:** Bob has been consistently increasing his offer, but in smaller increments. This suggests he's nearing his maximum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Pushing for more risks Bob walking away or stalling the negotiation to the point where you're forced to take John's offer.

While you could potentially squeeze out a bit more, accepting now secures a good profit and avoids the potential downsides of prolonged negotiation."
