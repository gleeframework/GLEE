"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a significant profit.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail, so I'm not afraid to push for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves me with a substantial profit. I believe this is a fair price that might be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's still potential for a higher offer from Bob, and I'm willing to push for it. I'll reject this offer and see if I can nudge Bob closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000.  This is a further compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering Bob's value for the product.  I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, as we're now approaching the midpoint between our initial positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, the risk of failing to reach a deal with Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price is increasing. Although $1,150,000 is still below my initial desired price, it's a significant profit and a safe bet considering the limited time and the risk of a lower offer from Bob in the future. Accepting this offer is the most prudent decision at this point."
