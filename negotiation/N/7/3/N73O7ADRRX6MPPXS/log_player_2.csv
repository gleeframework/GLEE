"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting her offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her own perceived value of $8,000. You always have the fallback option of buying from John for $12,000."
