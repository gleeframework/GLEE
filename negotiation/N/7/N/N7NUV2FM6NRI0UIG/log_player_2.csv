"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,550,000. It's a rare opportunity and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset. I know this is a significant investment, but I believe the value it offers will more than justify the price. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up who is ready to purchase at the listed value, so time is of the essence.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.
