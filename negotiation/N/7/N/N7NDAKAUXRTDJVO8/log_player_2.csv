"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This is a good starting offer from Alice, but there's room for negotiation. You can likely get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, which leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  By starting low, we can gauge Alice's flexibility on price and determine her bottom line. 
* **Alternative Option:** We always have John's offer of $1,500,000 as a fallback, so there's less pressure to accept a price that's too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Let me think for a moment... I can do $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is negotiating:** Alice's willingness to move from her initial offer, even if slightly, indicates she's open to negotiation. 
* **Price is still above target:** $1,300,000 is still a significant amount over our ideal price.
* **Room for compromise:**  There's a  $400,000 gap between Alice's current offer and John's offer, providing space for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $1,100,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This offer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($1,300,000) and our previous offer ($900,000), showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This keeps us well below John's $1,500,000 price, ensuring we're still getting a better deal if Alice accepts.
* **Maintaining Communication:**  Continuing to negotiate shows Alice we are serious about the purchase but are also aiming for a price that works for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $1,250,000. That's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firming up:**  Alice has clearly stated this is her lowest price. Pushing further might lead to her walking away.
* **Significant savings:** $1,250,000 is a $250,000 savings compared to John's offer, a substantial amount.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns.  We risk losing the deal with Alice for a potentially small additional discount, pushing us to John's higher price."
