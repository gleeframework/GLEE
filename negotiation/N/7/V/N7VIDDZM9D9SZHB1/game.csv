"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the product's value, I'd be happy to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into preparing it.

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,750?  It's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my costs. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to negotiating further. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",9200.0,Alice,5,
