"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, I believe your initial asking price is a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To move forward, I can offer it to you for $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I have a budget in mind for this purchase. I can increase my offer slightly to $1,175,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise, given we both have room to move from our current positions.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite far apart.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a very fair deal considering the value this product brings.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
