"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on your needs and preferences. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I propose a price of $140 for it. This offer takes into account both the product's worth to you and my aim to achieve a fair transaction. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $140 is within your budget, there's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price slightly. Rejecting her initial offer opens the door for negotiation.  You can always fall back on buying from John for $150 if needed."
