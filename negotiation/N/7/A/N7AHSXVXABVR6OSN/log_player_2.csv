"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great interest to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than the product's value to her, suggesting she has room to negotiate.  Since I'm willing to pay up to $15,000, I have some leverage to push for a lower price.  Rejecting her offer allows me to counter with a lower price and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product. This is still a good deal for both of us as it's well above your value for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,500 is my final offer. This still gives you a great deal on a product that's worth $15,000 to you.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above her valuation of $10,000, indicating she is willing to make a profit. While I can try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and forcing me to buy from John at $15,000 is too high. Accepting her offer saves me $3,500 compared to John's price, making it the most financially advantageous option."
