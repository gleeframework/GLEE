"Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  I understand it's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your company. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up, so time is of the essence.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
