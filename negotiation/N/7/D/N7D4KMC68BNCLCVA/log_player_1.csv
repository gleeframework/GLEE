Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $190. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 190} 

Reasoning:

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($120). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, it implies value by saying ""I think you'll find it's a great deal."" 
* **Room to Negotiate:**  My goal is to maximize profit, and this opening offer allows for me to potentially come down in price while still staying above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $190 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Reasoning:

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob increased his offer to $130, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for negotiation:**  His counter-offer indicates he's interested and willing to negotiate. I'll try to meet him somewhere in the middle.
* **John is my backup:** I'll keep John in mind as a guaranteed sale at $150, but I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. I could come down a bit to $170. I believe this product is truly worth it, and this is a very fair price."", ""product_price"": 170}

Reasoning:

* **Meeting in the middle:** I significantly decreased my price from $190 to $170, aiming to find a middle ground. 
* **Justification:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value to justify the relatively high price.
* **Strategic positioning:**  This counteroffer keeps me well above my minimum of $150 while still leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to come down to $170, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Reasoning:

* **Close enough:** Bob's offer of $140 is only $10 less than my guaranteed sale price with John. 
* **Time cost of negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might not result in a significantly better offer from Bob.  
* **Risk of losing both:** If I reject this offer and Bob walks away, I risk losing both potential buyers. 
 
While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $140 ensures a sale and a reasonable profit."
