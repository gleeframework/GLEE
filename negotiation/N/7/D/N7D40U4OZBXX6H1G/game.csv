"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's try to reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
