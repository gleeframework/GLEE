"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower.  How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're willing to negotiate, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to be fair.  Would you consider a final offer of $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close to my minimum as possible. How about we discuss a price of $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
