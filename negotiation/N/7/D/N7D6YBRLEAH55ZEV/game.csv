"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Could you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15,000? It's fair for both of us, and I'm happy to close the deal at that price.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,6,
