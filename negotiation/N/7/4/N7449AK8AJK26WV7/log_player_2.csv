"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible and the product is worth $80 to you. Alice's offer of $100 is too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  You've made a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still higher than your ideal price of $80.
* **Room for negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation and gives Alice a reason to consider your offer seriously. 
* **Staying within your budget:**  $85 is still within your acceptable range, so you're not losing anything if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a little bit to $95.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your target:**  Alice's new offer of $95 is still higher than your maximum price of $80. 
* **Negotiation room:** You have several rounds left, and Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. There's still potential to get a lower price.
* **Alternative option:** You can always go with John for $80, but it's worth seeing if you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $95 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm really hoping to make this work."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle ground:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer of $85 and Alice's latest offer of $95.
* **Showing commitment:** By offering to ""split the difference,"" you're showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product and are willing to meet her halfway.
* **Staying within your budget:** While $90 is closer to your maximum, it's still within your budget, so you're not taking a big risk."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $92? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to your offer. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above target:** Alice's offer of $92 is still higher than your maximum price of $80.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Alice has shown flexibility in her pricing. You can likely get a better price with continued negotiation.
* **Limited rounds:** With only a few rounds remaining, it's worth trying to see if you can push for a lower price. You can always buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $92 is closer but still a bit high for me. I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to go down to $88?  That would be a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last chance:** With only 4 rounds left, this is a good opportunity to make a final push. 
* **Small concession:** You're only asking for $4 less than Alice's offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Within your budget:**  $88 is still within your maximum price of $80. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** If Alice rejects this offer, you can always make a final counteroffer and then go to John if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $88 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90?  That's a good compromise, and we can finally close this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** Alice's offer of $90 is just $10 above your maximum price of $80. 
* **Limited rounds:** You have only three rounds left, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better offer in the remaining time.
* **Compromise:** While it's not your ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise, especially considering Alice has shown willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** It's better to accept this offer and secure the product than risk losing out to John or potentially getting a worse deal in the next few rounds."
