"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,800,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,750,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I recognize your budget constraints, I can't go as low as $1,750,000.  My final offer is $1,825,000.  Let me know if this works for you.",1825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $1,725,000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,200,000.",1725000.0,Bob,6,
