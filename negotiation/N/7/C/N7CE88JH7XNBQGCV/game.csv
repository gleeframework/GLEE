"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially offering it at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $14,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value and what I'm looking to get for it.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on $9,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's the most I can afford. Let's see if we can agree on this.",9000.0,Bob,4,
