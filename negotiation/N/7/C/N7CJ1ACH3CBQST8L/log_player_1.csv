Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice,  $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $70 for it.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'll try to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?"",
""product_price"": 95

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Let's try $85.  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

Bob's offer of $85 is higher than my minimum and John's offer. It makes the most sense to accept it."
