"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high. You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 but would prefer to save as much money as possible. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to secure a great deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious intent to negotiate. It's still within your budget, but it also leaves room for Alice to counter while ensuring you get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1050000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is still too high. While she is willing to compromise, it's not enough for you yet. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can push her closer to your target price. Buying from John at $1,500,000 is still an option if you can't reach a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering the potential value of the product for me. This shows my commitment to reaching a deal, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,150,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product to me.  Let's close this deal and avoid the need for further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer positions your offer as the final one, putting pressure on Alice to make a decision.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1150000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1225000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,225,000 is still too high for Bob's budget. With only three rounds remaining, the chances of negotiating a lower price are slim. It's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,500,000, as this will guarantee the purchase while still remaining within his budget. The potential savings from further negotiation with Alice aren't worth the risk of not securing the product at all."
