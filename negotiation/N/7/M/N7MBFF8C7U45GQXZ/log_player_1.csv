Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob first allows us to potentially earn more.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation but still represents a significant profit for Alice. It's a price point that's likely more appealing to Bob than a starting offer near $1,200,000.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:** Highlighting that this is an exclusive offer before it's open to others creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he declines."
