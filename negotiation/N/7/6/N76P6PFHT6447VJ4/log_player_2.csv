"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be valuable to you. I'm asking for $1000000 for it. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still a significant portion of your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds and Alice's initial offer is a good starting point for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. $1,000,000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** A significant counteroffer ($250,000 less) shows your serious intent to negotiate while leaving room for compromise.
* **Staying within budget:** $750,000 leaves you with a comfortable buffer in case Alice counter-offers.
* **Clear communication:** The message expresses appreciation and provides a specific counteroffer, giving Alice a clear understanding of your position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $750000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $850000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Room for improvement:**  $850,000 is still above your initial counteroffer and leaves room to negotiate further.
* **Avoid overpaying:** Accepting now could leave you with a feeling of having paid more than necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible. While $850,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to stay closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $800,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual increase:** A smaller counteroffer ($50,000) shows commitment to finding a compromise without risking an immediate rejection.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  The message frames the offer as mutually beneficial, appealing to Alice's desire for a good deal.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning finalizing the deal adds a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Alice to accept."
