"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair to both of us. I understand this is a substantial investment, but I'm confident you'll see the return on your investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
