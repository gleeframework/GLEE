"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its incredible value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I believe $950,000 is a bit steep.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $700,000  significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its value. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $750,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  However, $750,000 is still below my bottom line. Let's make this simple: I'll come down to $850,000, my final offer. This is a significant reduction on my part and a very fair price considering the value you'll be gaining.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is a strong offer, and I think it's important to recognize we both benefit from a successful deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
