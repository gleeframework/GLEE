"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. Given my research and the product's value, I'm willing to offer $750,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for a profitable deal on your end.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",850000.0,Bob,4,
