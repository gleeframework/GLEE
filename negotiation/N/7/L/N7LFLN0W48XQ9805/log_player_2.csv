"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to bring the price down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way outside my budget. This product would be useful to me, but I'm only willing to pay a price that reflects its value to me. How about $5,000?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer ($5,000) can help gauge Alice's flexibility and establish a lower baseline for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  While the offer is low, it's important to communicate that the value proposition isn't there at Alice's price.
* **Open for Negotiation:** By using phrases like ""How about,"" the message leaves room for Alice to counter and continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $5,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique benefits that you won't find elsewhere. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice has come down a bit, $11,000 is still too high. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and we should aim to get closer to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point we can both work with. To be honest, $11,000 is still a stretch for me. I'd be willing to consider $6,500.  This offer reflects the maximum value I can currently justify for the product."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're raising our offer from $5,000 to $6,500, demonstrating willingness to move towards a deal but at a controlled pace.
* **Setting a Limit:** By mentioning ""maximum value I can currently justify,"" we're signaling to Alice that significant jumps beyond this price point are unlikely.
* **Encouraging a Response:** We're still using open-ended language to encourage Alice to continue negotiating rather than walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations here. While I want to find a solution that works for both of us, I need to be realistic about the product's worth.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? This is a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but $9,500 is still too high. We're aiming for something closer to John's $8,000 price tag. We have a few more rounds to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position and I'm willing to increase my offer to show that I'm serious about purchasing this product. How about $7,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a fair agreement."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Substantial Increase:** We're raising the offer to $7,500, a $1,000 increase, to show Alice we are serious about a deal but want to meet closer to the middle ground. 
* **Highlighting Compromise:** We're emphasizing that this is a considerable move on our part, encouraging Alice to reciprocate with a more significant price drop on her end.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:** While we're moving closer to Alice's price, we are still holding firm below the $8,000 backup option we have with John."
