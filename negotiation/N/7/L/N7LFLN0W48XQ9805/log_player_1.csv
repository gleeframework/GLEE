Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way outside my budget. This product would be useful to me, but I'm only willing to pay a price that reflects its value to me. How about $5,000?

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point we can both work with. To be honest, $11,000 is still a stretch for me. I'd be willing to consider $6,500.  This offer reflects the maximum value I can currently justify for the product.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and I'm willing to increase my offer to show that I'm serious about purchasing this product. How about $7,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a fair agreement.

Bob is unlikely to reach a price point close to your minimum. He's consistently been significantly below your valuations, and while his offers are increasing, the pace is slow. It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
