Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

This offer aims to maximize profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  Here's the rationale:

* **Starting High:** $2,000,000 is a significant amount, and it immediately establishes a high value for the product in Bob's mind. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While I'm hoping for the full amount, I'm prepared to negotiate down to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 if necessary.  
* **Minimizing Risk:** If Bob rejects, I still have a guaranteed sale to John for my minimum price.

Let's see if Bob takes the bait!"
