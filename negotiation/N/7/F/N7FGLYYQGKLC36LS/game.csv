"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to be closer to $1,500,000 for this to make sense for me.  How about $1,450,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is getting closer, but I'm afraid I can't go that low. My absolute floor on this is $1,375,000.  This is a significant discount on my initial asking price, reflecting my desire to find a solution for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1375000.0,Alice,5,
