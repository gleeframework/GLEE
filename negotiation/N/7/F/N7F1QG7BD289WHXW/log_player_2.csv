"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to me. I am offering this exceptional item at a special price of $750000. This offer is exclusive and tailored to your potential interest in the product. I believe its worth far exceeds this amount, but I am willing to be flexible to explore a mutually beneficial transaction. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any questions about the product. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than the $1,000,000 you would pay to John.  Even if the product's value is less than $1,000,000 to you, accepting Alice's offer still results in a savings of $250,000."
