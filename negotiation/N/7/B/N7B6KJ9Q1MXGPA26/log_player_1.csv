Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's always best to aim for the highest possible profit.
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so any offer below this will likely be accepted. However, we want to maximize our gain.
* **Negotiating Room:** By starting at $1,400,000, we leave room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and positions it as an ""investment,"" subtly justifying the high price. 

This strategy balances securing a sale with maximizing potential profit."
