Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** I'm not going too high, so Bob is more likely to counteroffer, giving us a chance to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,500 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. Accepting this would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob is willing to negotiate, and I believe I can secure a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a compromise.
* **John is a strong backup:**  Knowing John is ready to buy at $15,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $13,000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $14,000 to $13,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not to give away too much.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm still friendly and emphasize the fairness of my offer.
* **Emphasize the value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him, making my offer seem more attractive.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  $13,000 is still above Bob's initial offer, suggesting that there's potential for a mutually agreeable price within a few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $12,800 is only slightly below my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Significantly higher than Bob's initial offer:** This is a much better deal than Bob's initial offer of $11,500.
* **Compromise and risk:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk Bob will walk away or John might not be available when I need him. It's better to secure a decent profit now than to risk getting nothing."
