"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my asking price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
