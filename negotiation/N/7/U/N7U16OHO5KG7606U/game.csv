"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $900,000 is still a little high for me.  How about $700,000?  That's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,5,
