{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This ensures you still make a profit and leaves room for potential counteroffers. 
* **It's a clear opening:**  The message establishes a friendly tone and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering.  Bob is showing interest, and I can leverage that by making a counteroffer that is still profitable for me."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,500? It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

This counteroffer is strategically placed:

* **It's a compromise:** It's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still profitable:** $10,500 is above my minimum value, ensuring I make a profit.
* **It's clear and concise:** The message is friendly but straightforward, making my intentions clear."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9,800? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below it.  I'm not desperate for a sale, and I can still potentially get closer to my target price with another counteroffer.  I'm going to try one more time to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we compromise at $10,200?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still above my minimum."", ""product_price"": 10200} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** This offer shows I'm willing to make a small concession while still ensuring I earn a decent profit.
* **Clear benefit:** $10,200 is significantly closer to my target price than Bob's offer, and it's still potentially acceptable to him.
* **Finality implied:**  The message subtly suggests this might be my final offer, encouraging Bob to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,900, which is the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,900 is still below my minimum value of $12,000.  I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like we're at an impasse.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price.  John is willing to pay my asking price, so it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
