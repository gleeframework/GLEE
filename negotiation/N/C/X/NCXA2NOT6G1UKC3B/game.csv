"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to its actual value. How about $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $500,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet somewhere in the middle â€“ how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000. That's a significant offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $750,000 is a sizable offer, the value of this product is truly undeniable. I could consider parting with it for $1,100,000. This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
