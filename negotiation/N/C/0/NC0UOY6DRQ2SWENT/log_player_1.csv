Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm more interested in a price point around $600,000. I believe this represents a fair offer, considering the market value and my specific needs. Let me know if this price range works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's tempting to accept John's offer for a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value and the benefits it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but the gap between our valuations is still quite large. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  This is a strong offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're making progress, but $700,000 is still too far from my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see Bob moving closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're narrowing the gap, but we're not quite there yet.  I'm willing to consider a price of $950,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to move to $750,000.  I feel this is a competitive offer and a reasonable compromise considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob seems stuck and unwilling to significantly increase his offer. It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap to a price that's acceptable to me within the remaining rounds. Selling to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000 is the best option at this point to avoid further negotiation and the risk of ending up with a lower offer."
