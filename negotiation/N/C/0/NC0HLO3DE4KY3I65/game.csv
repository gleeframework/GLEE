"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you've been interested in. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. It's a great deal, as I know it's worth a lot more to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a bit more flexibility.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than $12,000. How about we try $11,500? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? That's a fair compromise and gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $12,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original target of $11,000, so how about $11,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",11500.0,Bob,6,
