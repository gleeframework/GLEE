{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you've been interested in. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. It's a great deal, as I know it's worth a lot more to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob.  $11,000 is still a good amount, but I know the product is worth more to him. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a bit more flexibility."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than $12,000. How about we try $11,500? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise. $11,500 is still a good price, but I think I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? That's a fair compromise and gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $12,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original target of $11,000, so how about $11,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my initial asking price and represents a good return for me, especially considering the remaining rounds. I'd rather sell to Bob at this price than risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer."
