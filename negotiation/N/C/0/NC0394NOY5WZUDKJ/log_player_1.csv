{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being a reasonable price considering my minimum value of $12,000. It also demonstrates confidence in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I'm hoping to keep my investment within $10000. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? How about $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no point in further negotiation since I can get the same amount from John."
