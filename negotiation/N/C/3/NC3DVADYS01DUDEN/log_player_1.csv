Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and that she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  Starting high allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth, the message hints at its high value (""significant value,"" ""exceed your expectations""). This aims to justify the high asking price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone remains open for discussion (""Let me know your thoughts""). Alice wants to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market research:** This strategy assumes Alice doesn't have deep knowledge of the market beyond Bob and John. If she knew other potential buyers existed and their potential valuations, she might adjust her approach.
* **Relationship building:**  If Alice wants to establish a long-term relationship with Bob, a less aggressive starting price might be more suitable.
* **Bob's personality:** The offer assumes no prior knowledge of Bob's negotiation style. A different approach might be needed if Alice knew Bob to be particularly price-sensitive or skilled at negotiation."
