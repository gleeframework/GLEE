"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to both of us. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good deal, you are trying to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $100. This product is worth $120 to me, so I'm willing to pay a premium, but not $110. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your offer, I believe we can find a middle ground. I am willing to sell the product to you for $105. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a reasonable profit for me. Please let me know if this offer suits you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price of $100. Accepting the offer at $105 saves you $15 compared to buying from John, and still allows for a reasonable profit for Alice.  There's a good chance further negotiation will only result in a small reduction, which might not be worth the risk of losing the deal."
