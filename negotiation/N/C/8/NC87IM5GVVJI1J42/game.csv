"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the product's value to you.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,750,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
