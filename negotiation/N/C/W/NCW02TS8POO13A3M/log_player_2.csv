Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $400,000 at this time.

```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $600000 is still far from what this product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, but it reflects my desire to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal on this price.

You're still within the early rounds, so there's room for further negotiation."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still outside my budget.

Let's see if we can find a middle ground to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $750000 is still significantly below the product's true value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it for $1000000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Rejecting this offer will give you another chance to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a deal closer to your budget.  While John's offer is always a safe option, it's worth trying to get a better price from Alice."
