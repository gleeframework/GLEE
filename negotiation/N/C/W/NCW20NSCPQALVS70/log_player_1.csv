Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to give myself some negotiating room.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  The price is below my minimum but allows for potential negotiation if Bob counteroffers.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make the offer more appealing.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully sold the product for a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or counter again. 
* If the negotiation drags on or doesn't seem promising, I can always opt to sell to John for my minimum price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's close to my minimum, I'm willing to risk a counteroffer in hopes of getting closer to my desired price. I believe there's still potential to negotiate a better deal, given Bob is willing to pay a premium and is already demonstrating a desire for the product. 

**Next steps:**

I will make a counteroffer, aiming for a price somewhere between my minimum and Bob's offer. This will allow for further negotiation and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I see you're really interested in the product! While I can't go as low as $12,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,250?  This price is still a good value for you, and it helps me get closer to my target. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** My counteroffer is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Highlight the value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, emphasizing that this price is still a good deal for him.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I use a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable. 

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a price that's closer to my minimum, but still within a reasonable range for both of us.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make another counteroffer, or sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is close to my desired price of $13,250.  It's also above his initial offer and demonstrates his commitment to purchasing the product. While it's still a bit lower than my ideal, I believe the potential for a lengthy negotiation isn't worth the risk.  There's also a chance that John could change his mind about buying the product, so it's wise to secure a sale with Bob while I can. 

**Next steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and complete the sale, securing a profit while minimizing the risk of a delayed or unsuccessful negotiation."
