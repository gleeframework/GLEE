Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** $14,000 is a fair price considering Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Is above your minimum:** $14,000 is more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **Is concise and clear:**  The message is straightforward and explains the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get a better deal. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe there's still room for a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium, $12,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. This would ensure we both get a fair deal.  Let me know if you're open to this compromise."", ""product_price"": 13250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $13,000 is reasonable and above my minimum.  It's a good deal that allows me to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiations or having to sell to John for a lower price."
