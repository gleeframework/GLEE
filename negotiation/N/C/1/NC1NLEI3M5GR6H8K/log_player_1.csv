Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This sets a high baseline for the negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Interests:**  I emphasize the value for Bob and use positive language to encourage a positive response.
* **Flexibility:**  I leave room for negotiation while still maintaining a price that's significantly closer to my minimum value of $1,000,000. 

**Strategy:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, I win! If he rejects, I can assess his counteroffer.
* **Strategic Counteroffers:** If Bob counteroffers, I'll aim for a price that's closer to my minimum while still being attractive enough to avoid losing the deal.
* **John as a Backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring that I can secure my minimum value if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it indicates his interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Stronger Position:** I can leverage my backup option with John to push for a better price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer with a price that is closer to my desired range but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  I will make it clear that I am not desperate to sell and have a viable alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a strong position. 
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, implicitly stating that $850,000 is a fair price for what he's getting.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  I leave room for further negotiation, indicating that I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial solution.

**Strategy:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:** I'll closely observe Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and potentially make another counteroffer.
* **Leveraging John:**  I'll continue to keep John as a backup option in mind, reminding me of my minimum acceptable price and giving me the confidence to push for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly his perceived value. This means there's little room for further negotiation, and any further counteroffers might risk losing the deal.
* **Profitable Deal:** Although $800,000 is below my ideal price, it still represents a substantial profit. 
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting this offer avoids further negotiation rounds, saving time and effort.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of a deal falling through.
* **Future Opportunities:** By selling to Bob, I can potentially build a relationship for future business opportunities."
