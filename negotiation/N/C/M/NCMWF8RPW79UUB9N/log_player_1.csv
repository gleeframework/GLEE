"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and the benefits it provides, I believe a starting price of $18,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is considerably less than what I had in mind.  To make this worthwhile for both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500?  It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.
