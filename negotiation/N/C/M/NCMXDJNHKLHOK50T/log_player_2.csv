"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a great starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($800,000 vs. $1,200,000).  There's a lot of room for negotiation, and I want to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding the middle ground:**  My counteroffer is halfway between Alice's offer and my maximum budget ($800,000 + $1,200,000) / 2 = $1,000,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also establishes a firm starting point for me.
* **Showing confidence:** My message conveys a sense of confidence that we can reach a deal, but it also implies that I'm not desperate to buy the product at any price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still a bit far from where I'd like to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but it's still a bit high. I'm hoping to get closer to $1,000,000, so I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference again and go with $975,000?  It's closer to what I can afford, and it gives us both some room to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:** This counteroffer shows Alice that I'm actively participating in the negotiation and not just throwing out random numbers.
* **Finding the middle ground (again):** By splitting the difference between my last offer ($1,000,000) and Alice's latest offer ($950,000), I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise and make the deal work. 
* **Positive framing:** The message focuses on the benefits for both of us, emphasizing a ""win-win"" scenario."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there yet, but I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm offering a counteroffer of $975,500. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair middle ground. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,500 is extremely close to my last counteroffer of $975,000. It's only a $500 difference, which is negligible given the overall price.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity by continuing to haggle."
