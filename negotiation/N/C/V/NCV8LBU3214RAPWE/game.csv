"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $16,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. ",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $16,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. How about $15,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal!",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been great to work with, and I think we're very close. Would you consider $14,500?  That's a fair compromise and would allow me to close the deal today.",14500.0,Bob,6,
