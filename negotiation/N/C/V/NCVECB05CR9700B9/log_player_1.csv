{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob accepts, I'll make a decent profit. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest and make a counteroffer.  I'll also keep John's offer in mind in case the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to consider $10,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $500 more than John's offer.  It's worth exploring if we can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,750 is only $250 less than my last counteroffer of $11,000.  It's a significant increase from John's offer, and it's getting closer to my desired price point.  At this point, it's best to accept his offer and avoid the risk of losing him completely."
