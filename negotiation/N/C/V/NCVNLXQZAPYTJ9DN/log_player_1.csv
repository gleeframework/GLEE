"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $15,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway and settle at $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $9,000. Accepting his offer nets $9,000, while John offers a guaranteed $10,000. It makes more financial sense to cut negotiations short and sell to John for the guaranteed higher price."
