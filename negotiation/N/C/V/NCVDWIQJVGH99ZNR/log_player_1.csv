"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still getting a significant profit. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly what I offered in the first round, so I'll accept it. This is a good price, and I'm not sure I'd get a better offer in subsequent rounds, especially considering I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
