"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  I'm starting high, aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $1,500,000 leaves plenty of space for Bob to make counteroffers without me feeling like I'm giving away too much.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000  gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob makes lowball offers.

**Strategy:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:**  Bob's reaction will tell me a lot about his interest level and perceived value of the product.
* **Adapt Accordingly:** Depending on his response, I'll either  lower my price slightly in subsequent rounds or hold firm.
* **Don't Be Afraid to Walk:**  If Bob's offers remain too low or if he's being unreasonable, I won't hesitate to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:** Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a better deal by continuing the process.
* **Testing the Waters:** This rejection gives me valuable information about Bob's upper limit. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is waiting, I can be patient and strategic in my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll likely counter with a price slightly below my initial offer, perhaps $1,400,000, to see if we can reach a compromise.
* **Evaluate Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's next counteroffer (if he makes one) to determine if it's worth accepting or if I should continue negotiating.
* **Don't Rush:** I'm in a strong position with John as a backup, so I won't feel pressured to accept a deal too quickly."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:**  I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, showing flexibility but not giving away too much. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I'll have a better idea of how much he's truly willing to pay.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm still confident in my ability to sell to John if necessary, giving me the leverage to hold firm on this counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:**  Bob's reaction to this offer will be crucial. If he accepts, we have a deal. If he rejects, I'll have to make a decision based on his counteroffer and my overall assessment of the situation.
* **Stay Flexible:** While I'm holding firm on my desired price, I'm willing to adjust my counteroffer as needed, based on Bob's responses.
* **Focus on Value:** I'll try to remind Bob of the product's worth and highlight the benefits of accepting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting it would be a major loss.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a better option at this point, as it guarantees a profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are still several rounds remaining, and I believe there's potential to get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll likely counter with a price somewhere between Bob's offer and my previous offer, perhaps $1,250,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still value the product.
* **Assess Bob's Motivation:**  I'll closely analyze Bob's counteroffers and try to understand his true value for the product. 
* **Stay Firm:** If Bob doesn't budge, I won't hesitate to sell to John to secure a guaranteed profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from my previous offer but still above my minimum acceptable price and Bob's current offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I'll have a better idea of how much he's truly willing to pay.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm still confident in my ability to sell to John if necessary, giving me the leverage to hold firm on this counteroffer.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:**  Bob's offer is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price. It's tempting, but I believe I can still squeeze a better deal.
* **John is a Better Option Right Now:**  John's offer guarantees me $1,000,000, and I'm running out of time. 
* **Risky to Continue:**  I'm not sure if Bob is truly willing to go higher, and if he rejects my next counteroffer, I'll have to rely on John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, perhaps $1,100,000, to see if we can close the deal.
* **Evaluate Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's reaction and decide if I'm willing to risk another rejection. 
* **Prepare to Sell to John:** If Bob doesn't accept my next counteroffer, I'll move forward with selling to John to secure a guaranteed profit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  I'm pushing for a price just slightly higher than Bob's last offer, hoping to close the deal and secure a bit more profit.  I've been willing to compromise, but I don't want to risk going too low and ending up with John's offer.
* **Limited Time:** We're down to the wire, and I need to secure a deal. If Bob rejects, I will likely move to John to guarantee the sale.
* **Assessing Bob's Motivation:**  Bob's response will reveal his true willingness to pay. If he accepts, it's a win for me. If he rejects, it's time to switch to John. 

**Strategy:**

* **Be Prepared to Sell to John:** I'm mentally prepared to sell to John if this counteroffer fails.
* **No Further Negotiation:**  I've already compromised a lot, and I won't budge further.  This is my final offer.
* **Focused on Results:** My goal is to maximize profit.  I'm no longer focused on a ""fair"" price; I'm focused on getting the best possible deal."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and even lower than John's offer. Accepting it would result in a significant financial loss.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're down to our last two rounds. It's unlikely that Bob will significantly increase his offer in the next round.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is the best outcome at this point. 

**Strategy:**

* **Avoid Risk:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer in the next round.  Selling to John is the safest option to secure a profit.
* **Maximize Earnings:**  While I would prefer to get more than $1,000,000, it's better to secure a guaranteed profit than to risk losing money by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Focus on the Big Picture:**  This decision prioritizes securing a profit over trying to extract the maximum possible price."
