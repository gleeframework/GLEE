"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you this great product for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  You value the product at $120, and Alice is offering it for $110. This saves you $10 compared to buying from John.
* **Even though Alice values the product at $80, the $110 price is still a good deal for you.** It allows you to buy the product within your budget and get a better price than John's offer."
