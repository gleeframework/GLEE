{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal to entice Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price gives me room to lower the price if Bob counters, while still ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Preparing for a potential counteroffer:**  I'm ready to negotiate if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, he has expressed interest in the product. This suggests there is room for negotiation.
* **John's offer:**  While I could sell to John for $150, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Appealing to Bob's interest:** I'm highlighting that this is still a good deal for Bob. 
* **Maintaining profitability:** $125 allows me to make a profit while still being within a reasonable range for Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Encouraging a response:** My message is friendly and optimistic, aiming to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is still unacceptable, he has shown a willingness to increase his offer. This suggests there's still room to negotiate.
* **John's offer:**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum acceptable price.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to come down to $110 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a profit while you get a great deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my previous offer, showing I'm serious about finding a deal.
* **Finding a middle ground:** $110 is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's current offer.
* **Positive message:** I'm focusing on the mutual benefit of the deal and encouraging a positive response.
* **Setting a deadline:** While not explicitly stated, my message suggests I'm ready to close the deal. This might encourage Bob to accept."
