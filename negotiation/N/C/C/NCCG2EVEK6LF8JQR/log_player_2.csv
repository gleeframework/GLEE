"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth at least $20,000 in the current market, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is a ""good deal"" based on the market value, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Since he can get the same product from John for $10,000, rejecting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous choice for Bob."
