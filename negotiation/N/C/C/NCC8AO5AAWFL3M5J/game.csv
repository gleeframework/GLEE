"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me is significantly higher.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This represents a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but I can't go any higher.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit while still offering you a good deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
