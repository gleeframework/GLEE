"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,500 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. Let's see if we can close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $9,000 is still a bit short of what I need.  I'm prepared to compromise and offer you the product for $9,250. This is my final offer, let's make this happen.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,100, which is a good compromise. Let's make this happen.",9100.0,Bob,6,
