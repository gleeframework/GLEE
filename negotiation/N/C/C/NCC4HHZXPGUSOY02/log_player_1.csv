"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum but still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation while also ensuring I don't give away too much value in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's far from my minimum price of $12,000.  I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,500 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm taking a slight step towards Bob's offer but still holding firm on a price that is closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this signals my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a good bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I've already come down a significant amount, and I believe there's room for Bob to increase his offer further. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $9,000 is still a bit short of what I need.  I'm prepared to compromise and offer you the product for $9,250. This is my final offer, let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, but this time I'm calling it my final offer. This signals that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I hope this pressure will push Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,100, which is a good compromise. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $9,100 is still lower than my ideal price, it's only $100 away from my final offer and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer ensures a deal and saves me the risk of further bargaining that might not lead to a better outcome.  It's also more than Bob's initial offer, and a good deal overall."
