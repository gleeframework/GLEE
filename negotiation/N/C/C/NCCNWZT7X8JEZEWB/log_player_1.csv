Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to part with it for $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down, while still keeping you well above your minimum price. 
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:** Offering a price too close to your minimum ($80) might make Bob think the product isn't valuable and discourage him from buying. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price that's highly profitable for you while still being appealing to him."
