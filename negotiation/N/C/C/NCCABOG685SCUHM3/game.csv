"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it, reflecting its unique qualities and potential for your business.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This represents a fair price considering the potential benefits and allows us both to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. Let's see if we can work this out.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you while acknowledging the unique benefits of this product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This represents a good compromise and allows us to both benefit from this deal. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I value your continued interest, $950,000 is still below the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which represents a fair price for both of us.  This allows you to secure this valuable asset while ensuring I get a reasonable return. Let's finalize this deal now.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
