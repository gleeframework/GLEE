Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This represents a fair price considering the potential benefits and allows us both to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. Let's see if we can work this out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
