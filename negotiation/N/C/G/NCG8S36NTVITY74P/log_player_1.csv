Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 would be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. A price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob, increasing the risk of rejection. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially transforming your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Given its potential impact on your business, I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial offer."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, creating a positive frame for the negotiation.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value ($150,000 profit) while still offering Bob a compelling discount ($50,000 less than his perceived value).
* **Confidence:** By expressing confidence in the offer's fairness, you aim to nudge Bob towards acceptance.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer.  You could explore different prices within the ZOPA based on your risk tolerance and assessment of Bob's negotiating style."
