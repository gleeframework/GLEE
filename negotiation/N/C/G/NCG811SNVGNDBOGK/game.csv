,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to come down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm still very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $115.  Let's split the difference.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to compromise. I can do $130, which is a bit closer to your target. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $120. That would be a fair price for both of us, and we could close the deal.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more move. I can do $127.50, which is a slight concession from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",127.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm almost there, but $127.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down just a little bit more to $125?  I'm really hoping to close this deal and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",125.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, Bob! I can do $126.25, which is a slight concession from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",126.25,Alice,9,
