"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,500,000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,350,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This feels like a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
