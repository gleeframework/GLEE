"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $145 is within your budget, you can try to get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her product's value of $120.  You can always buy from John for $150 if needed."
