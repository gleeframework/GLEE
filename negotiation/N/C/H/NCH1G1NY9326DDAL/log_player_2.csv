It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  The price is significantly lower than what you're willing to pay, so there's room to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}

I'm starting with a low counteroffer, hoping to get Alice to come down from her initial price.  This will also help gauge her willingness to negotiate."

While $5,500 is a decent price, there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to keep trying to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying but still trying to keep the price low.  I'm hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While I'd still prefer to pay less, $5,200 is a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy from her."
