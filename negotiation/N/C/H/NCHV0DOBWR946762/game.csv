"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe the product's value is worth it, and I'm confident you'll see that too.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10,500?  That's a good compromise and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $11,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10,750? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",10750.0,Alice,5,
