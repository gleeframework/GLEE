"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. This price still leaves me with a profit, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? It's a good deal for both of us, and we can close this transaction quickly.",9750.0,Bob,4,
