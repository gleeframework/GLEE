Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,600,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower and offer $1,575,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is clearly engaged and negotiating in good faith. $1,575,000 is a substantial profit, and continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer. It's better to secure a strong offer now."
