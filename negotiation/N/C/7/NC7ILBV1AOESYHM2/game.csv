"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value the product, $600,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm happy to pay $500,000.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $575,000. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it. What do you think?",575000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $575,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we split the difference and settle on $537,500?  It's a fair compromise, and allows us both to reach an agreement.",537500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $537,500 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm thinking of a price of $550,000. It's a small increase, but I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",550000.0,Alice,5,
