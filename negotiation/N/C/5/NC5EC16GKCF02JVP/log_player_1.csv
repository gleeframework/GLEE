Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, we can negotiate down from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $15,000 is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm offering $16,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough to Bob while still allowing me to get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm offering $15,000.  This is a final attempt to reach a compromise with Bob before I consider selling to John. This price is a reasonable middle ground between our last offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer of $14,000 is getting close to my minimum, but I don't think I can push for more. It's not worth risking further negotiation, especially since John is guaranteed to buy at my minimum price."
