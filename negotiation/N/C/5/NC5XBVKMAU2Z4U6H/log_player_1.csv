Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and I'm offering it to you first. Given its value, I propose a price of $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can leverage this security to aim higher with Bob. 
* **50% Markup:** The offer of $1,500,000 represents a significant 50% profit margin if Bob accepts. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial gain.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob provides a starting point. Offering it above this value creates a negotiation space where Bob might be willing to pay a premium to avoid missing out."
