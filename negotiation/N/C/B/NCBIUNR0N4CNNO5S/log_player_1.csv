Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its worth and the benefit you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for me.
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.  

**Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing I can sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $10,000."
