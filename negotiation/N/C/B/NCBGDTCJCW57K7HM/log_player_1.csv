Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate. Holding firm might push him closer to our desired price range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,110,000 for the product. This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're coming down in smaller increments now to signal that we're nearing our bottom line.  This offer keeps the pressure on Bob while still allowing room for some final negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to pay $1,060,000 for the product. I think this is the best compromise we can reach. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close to John's offer, but there's still a reasonable margin.  Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, indicating he's still interested. Rejecting this keeps the negotiation alive and might prompt him to move closer to our price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation from your side.  I'm willing to make one final concession to seal this deal.  Let's settle on $1,090,000. This is my absolute best offer."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're now getting very close to our fallback option with John. This firm counter-offer emphasizes the value of the product and puts a clear deadline on the negotiation, prompting Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,040,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now stated this is his final offer, and while it's less than we hoped, it's still a $40,000 profit over John's guaranteed offer.  Continuing the negotiation at this point risks him lowering his offer or sticking to this price, leaving us with a smaller gain or having to accept the fallback option."
