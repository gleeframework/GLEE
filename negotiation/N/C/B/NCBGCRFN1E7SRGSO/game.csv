"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,600,000. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm willing to go. This product has value, but I'm looking for something closer to the  $700,000 - $800,000 range. Would you be willing to come down significantly on the price?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. This product offers substantial benefits, and I'm confident it can bring you a great return on your investment.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has potential, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me to consider.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but to be frank, I'm prepared to walk away from this deal if we can't find common ground.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction, reflecting my desire to reach a deal with you.  I believe this price accurately reflects the value this product can bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I can go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I need to see some movement from you to justify going any higher.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your hesitation, and I want to be straightforward.  I have another potential buyer who's prepared to offer me $1,200,000 for this product. However, I believe in finding the right fit, and I value our negotiations. I'm willing to make one final offer at  $1,000,000. This is a firm offer, and I need a decision from you this round.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
