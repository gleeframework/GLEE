"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm willing to go. This product has value, but I'm looking for something closer to the  $700,000 - $800,000 range. Would you be willing to come down significantly on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. This product offers substantial benefits, and I'm confident it can bring you a great return on your investment.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,250,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has potential, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me to consider.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but to be frank, I'm prepared to walk away from this deal if we can't find common ground.  Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is starting to show more flexibility, but his offer is still significantly below my minimum.  I'll reject and counter-offer, but I need to start moving towards John's offer as a safety net if Bob won't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction, reflecting my desire to reach a deal with you.  I believe this price accurately reflects the value this product can bring to your business."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I can go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I need to see some movement from you to justify going any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is increasing his offer, we're still far apart.  He's at $900,000 and I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. John's offer of $1,200,000 is looking more appealing, but I'll try one more time to bridge the gap with Bob before resorting to that."

However, I believe in finding the right fit, and I value our negotiations. I'm willing to make one final offer at  $1,000,000. This is a firm offer, and I need a decision from you this round."",
