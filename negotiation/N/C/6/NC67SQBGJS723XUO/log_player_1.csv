"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My initial offer is $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's below Bob's value but still leaves me with a profit. This should give me room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a better price. While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  That's still a great deal for you, and it leaves me a little room to make a profit. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about $132?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial target of $140, $132 is a good compromise and still gives me a decent profit.  It's also significantly better than selling to John for $120.  I'm happy to close the deal and move on."
