Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm offering it at a price that reflects its value. Would you be willing to pay $950,000 for it?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Strategic positioning:** The offered price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still lower than what John will pay. This creates a potential win-win scenario where Bob might negotiate a price he finds acceptable while you still earn a significant profit. 
* **Alternative in mind:** You are secure knowing John will buy the product for your desired minimum, so you can afford to be firm in negotiations with Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while acknowledging the possibility of Bob's rejection."
