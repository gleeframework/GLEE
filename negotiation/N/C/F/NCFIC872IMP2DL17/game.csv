"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $14,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I still need it to be a little more affordable. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
