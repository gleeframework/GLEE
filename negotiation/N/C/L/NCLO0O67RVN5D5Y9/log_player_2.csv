"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Alice is offering it for $115. While this is a good deal, you can get the product from John for $120, which is still within your budget. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate with her further or see if she drops the price to something closer to your maximum."
