"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm not quite ready to pay $1500000.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for less than a significantly higher price.  I'll try to counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a chance to close a deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  I believe this offer is fair and reflects the value we're both looking for. Let's keep talking. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
