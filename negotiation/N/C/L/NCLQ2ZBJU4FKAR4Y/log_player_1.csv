Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible. Offering it for $14,000 gives Bob a good deal (he values it at $15,000) while still netting me a significant profit over my minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting at $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate up slightly if he's inclined.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:** Offering it too close to $15,000 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could make him less likely to accept."
