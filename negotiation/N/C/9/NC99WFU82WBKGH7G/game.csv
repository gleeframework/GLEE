"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $8200 for the product. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8200 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $8000. This is my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $8500. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
