While we could continue negotiating, accepting Bob's offer at $860,000 is a good deal.  Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  We are still making a $60,000 profit over John's offer.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and the risk of Bob lowering his offer further.
* **Uncertainty of Future Rounds:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer a better price, and we risk ending up with John's $800,000 offer if negotiations fail."
