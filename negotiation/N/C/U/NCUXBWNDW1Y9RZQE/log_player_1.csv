Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  It's a fantastic deal for something of this quality and value."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Anchoring:** By offering a high initial price, I'm setting an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, the final price is more likely to be favorable to me.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I know I have John as a backup buyer at $15,000, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob. This gives me leverage.

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might be put off by the high initial price and refuse to negotiate. However, it's a calculated risk I'm willing to take to maximize my potential profit."
