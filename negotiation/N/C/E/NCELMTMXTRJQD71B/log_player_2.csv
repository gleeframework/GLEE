"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth $100 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  It's a steal at that price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Even though you believe the product is worth $100 to you, Alice is selling it for $90. This is a better deal than paying $100 to John. 
* **You're still saving money.** You are able to buy the product for $10 less than your maximum budget."
