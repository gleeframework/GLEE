Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a significant profit but still leaving room for negotiation.  This price is above my minimum but below Bob's perceived value, so it should be attractive to him.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's above my minimum, I can likely get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price closer to my initial offer.  $1,300,000 is a fair compromise that should hopefully be acceptable to both of us."
