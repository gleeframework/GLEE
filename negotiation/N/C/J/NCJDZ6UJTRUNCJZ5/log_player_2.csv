"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product to you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is better than $120, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, $110 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum value ($80). This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $95 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $105, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $110 to $105, which is a good compromise.  At $105, Bob is still saving $15 compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price for Bob, and he doesn't need to risk further negotiation."
