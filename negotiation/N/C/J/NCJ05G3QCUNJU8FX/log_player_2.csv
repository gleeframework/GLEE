Alice is coming down, but we can still try to push for a better deal.  We'll counteroffer slightly below her price to encourage her to move closer to $8,000."

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, and this offer is a reasonable compromise. It's better to accept a good deal than risk losing it by pushing too hard."
