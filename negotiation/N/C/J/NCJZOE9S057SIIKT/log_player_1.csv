Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate.
* **It's less than your minimum:**  This gives you a buffer in case Bob counters.
* **It's a reasonable price:** It's not so high that Bob will immediately reject it.

By starting with a slightly higher price, you create a space for negotiation and increase the chances of getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. It's not worth accepting his offer because I can sell to John for a much better price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit margin.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees a better outcome, so I'll choose to sell the product to him."
