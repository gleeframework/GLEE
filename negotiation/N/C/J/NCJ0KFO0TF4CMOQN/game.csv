"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1750000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1750000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1850000. This price reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1800000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it allows us both to make a good deal.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
