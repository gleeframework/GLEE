"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to my asking price. How about $950,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and your profit margin. Let's make a deal!",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $925,000? This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my profit margin. Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
