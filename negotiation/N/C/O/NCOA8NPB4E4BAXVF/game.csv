"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm not quite ready to come down to $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,
