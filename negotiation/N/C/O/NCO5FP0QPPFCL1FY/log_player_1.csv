Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **Above John's Offer:** The offer is significantly higher than John's offer ($12,000), making it clear you're seeking a premium price from Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob counters, but don't go below your minimum of $12,000."
