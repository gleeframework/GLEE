Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but we're still quite a ways apart.  To be frank, anything above $1,000,000 makes it less appealing than simply going with a different vendor.  Would you consider $925,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  While $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to come up to $975,000.  I think this represents a fair compromise, and would allow us to close this deal.

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $1,000,000 valuation. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed deal."
