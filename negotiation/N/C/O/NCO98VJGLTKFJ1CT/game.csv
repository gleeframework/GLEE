"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that initial price is quite high. I appreciate the potential of the product, but I'm looking to make a purchase closer to market value.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. While $800,000 is too low, I'm willing to move down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true value of this product and its potential returns.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but we're still quite a ways apart.  To be frank, anything above $1,000,000 makes it less appealing than simply going with a different vendor.  Would you consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I recognize the value of a mutually beneficial deal. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to come up to $975,000.  I think this represents a fair compromise, and would allow us to close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
