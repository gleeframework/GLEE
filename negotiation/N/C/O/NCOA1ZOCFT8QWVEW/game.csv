"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I see the value in this product, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm happy to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. $16,000 is closer, but still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is my final offer, as I'm ready to move forward with the purchase if we can agree.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit above your final offer of $15,500. I'm willing to meet you at $16,250. It's a small step up from your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16250.0,Alice,5,
