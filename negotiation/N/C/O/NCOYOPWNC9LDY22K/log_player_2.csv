Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $12,000 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need to get closer to my target. Can you meet me at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $11,250? That's the best I can do at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's becoming clear that Alice is very unlikely to go down to a price that makes sense for you. She's playing a tough game of negotiation. At this point, you're better off taking John's offer of $8,000.  You'll save yourself more time and potentially more money by cutting off further negotiation with Alice."
