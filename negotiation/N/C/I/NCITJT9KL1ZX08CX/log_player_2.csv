"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is way above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $15,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $13,000 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target of $12,000. Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, but he should try to negotiate further to get a better price. It's worth continuing the negotiation with Alice as there's still room to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're willing to go up to $12,000, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there yet. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm offering $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly from $13,000 to $14,000, but it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's a risk that further negotiation will not lead to a lower price, and with only 5 rounds left, time is running out.  It's more efficient for Bob to secure the product at his target price from John.  While there's a chance he could get it for less from Alice, the risk of getting a worse deal is too high."
