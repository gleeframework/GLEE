,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $90 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $70? I think that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $70 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $85?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $78? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",78.0,Bob,4,
