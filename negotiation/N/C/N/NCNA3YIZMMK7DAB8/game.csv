"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great fit for your needs and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of this product, but your asking price is a bit high for my budget. I'm prepared to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this point. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
