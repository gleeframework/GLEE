"I appreciate your initial offer, and I'm excited about the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial price. Would you consider $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still a bit above $1,200,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,237,500? I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",1237500.0,Bob,4,
