"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum value of $1,500,000. This strategy has a few advantages:

* **Establishes a strong starting point:** It sets the tone for the negotiation and gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Tests Bob's interest:** If he rejects this offer, it tells me that he might be seriously interested but is seeking a lower price. 
* **Prepares for potential counteroffers:** I have room to lower the price in subsequent rounds if necessary.

However, if Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to lower my price in subsequent rounds. I will keep an eye on the number of rounds left and my minimum acceptable price to make sure I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still lower than my desired selling price.  I have several rounds left, and I believe I can still get closer to my desired $2,000,000.

**Here's my strategy:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:**  Show him I'm not desperate for a quick sale.
* **Counteroffer in Round 3:**  I'll make a counteroffer closer to $2,000,000, but still slightly lower than my initial offer.

This approach allows me to maintain a sense of control and maximize my potential profit. I am also considering John's offer as a safety net, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a counteroffer at $1,900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway, while still aiming for a higher price.

* **Strategic Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to cave in too quickly.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By not accepting Bob's offer immediately, I retain some leverage and potentially increase my chances of getting closer to my desired price.
* **Balancing Risk:**  While I want to secure a deal, I'm also aware that Bob might reject this offer again. I have several rounds remaining, so I can still adjust my strategy accordingly.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider lowering my counteroffer again in the next round, but I'll be cautious not to go too low too quickly. I'm also keeping John's offer as a backstop, ready to sell him if negotiations with Bob stall or if the remaining rounds become limited."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and I believe I can get closer to my goal.  While Bob's offer is improving, it's still below my desired range.

Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting, I avoid settling too quickly.
* **Rounds Remaining:** With several rounds left, I can continue to negotiate. 
* **Closing the Gap:**  I'm confident that I can push Bob closer to my desired price point with a few more rounds.

**Strategy for Round 5:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer at $1,875,000. This offer is a compromise between my previous counteroffer and Bob's current offer. It shows I'm willing to be flexible but still holding onto a decent profit margin. 

I'm also keeping a close eye on the number of rounds remaining and the potential of selling to John as a safety net if the negotiation doesn't progress favorably."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting again shows Bob that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Rounds Remaining:**  I have four rounds left, which gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I'm confident that with a few more rounds, I can push for a higher price that is closer to my target.

**Strategy for Round 7:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer at $1,850,000. This is a compromise, but it's still slightly higher than Bob's latest offer. I'm aiming for a middle ground that is more favorable to me.

I'm keeping a close eye on the remaining rounds and the potential of selling to John as a safety net if the negotiation doesn't progress favorably.  However, I'm still optimistic about closing a deal with Bob at a price closer to my desired range."

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer is $1,850,000. This is a compromise, but still slightly higher than Bob's latest offer. I'm aiming for a middle ground that is more favorable to me. 

* **Strategic Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but maintains a solid profit margin.
* **Closing the Gap:**  It narrows the gap between our offers, making a deal seem increasingly likely.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's offer immediately, I keep some leverage in the negotiation.

I'm aware that time is running out, but I'm confident that I can close a deal with Bob at a price closer to my desired range.  I'm also monitoring the situation and keeping John's offer as a fallback in case negotiations with Bob falter."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to negotiate a higher price. While $1,800,000 is still lower than my ideal price, it's a significant profit, and I'm confident I can't push Bob any further.

Here's why I'm accepting the offer:

* **Time Constraint:** With only two rounds left, I risk getting stuck with a worse deal from John or a complete breakdown in negotiations. 
* **Significant Profit:**  $1,800,000 is a substantial profit, well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Reduced Leverage:**  My leverage is diminishing with fewer rounds remaining. 

Accepting this offer secures a solid profit and avoids the risk of a worse outcome."
