"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $80.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $80 is quite low considering the product's value. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $130.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $80. If we can't reach an agreement at that price, I'll have to go with John's offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being upfront. However, I can't sell this product for $80. It's worth significantly more than that, and I wouldn't be doing it justice.  How about $125?  This is my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
