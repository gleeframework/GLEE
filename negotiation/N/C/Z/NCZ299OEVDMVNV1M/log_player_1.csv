"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $150. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Gauge Interest:** This first offer will help me understand how interested Bob is in the product and how flexible he might be on price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $80.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is far too low and is exactly his perceived value. Accepting would mean selling significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and prepare a counteroffer for Round 3."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $80 is quite low considering the product's value. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $130."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from $150 to $130, signaling willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Middle Ground:** Offering a price seemingly in the ""middle"" can be a psychologically effective negotiation tactic, even though it's skewed towards my desired outcome.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help me understand if Bob is willing to move significantly from his initial lowball offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $80. If we can't reach an agreement at that price, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bluffing:** Bob is likely bluffing about John's offer to pressure me into accepting his low price. 
* **Maintaining Position:** Accepting $80 would be a significant loss. I need to show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Next Steps:** I'll use my next counteroffer to call his bluff and gauge if he's really willing to walk away. I'll move slightly closer to his offer, but not significantly."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being upfront. However, I can't sell this product for $80. It's worth significantly more than that, and I wouldn't be doing it justice.  How about $125?  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Calling the Bluff:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm putting pressure on Bob and calling his bluff about John's offer.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm moving down slightly to $125, showing a willingness to compromise, but only marginally.
* **Protecting Value:** I'm still holding firm above my minimum price, ensuring I don't make a loss. 
* **Deadline Pressure:** Introducing a sense of urgency might push Bob to make a more realistic offer or walk away."
