"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This price still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
