"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the benefit it will bring to your specific needs.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of your product, I believe the asking price is a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
