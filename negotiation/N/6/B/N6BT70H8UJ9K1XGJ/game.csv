"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $20000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value this product holds, I'm willing to come down to $17500. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're holding out for a good price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $17500 is still a bit steep for me, but I'm willing to pay $14000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
