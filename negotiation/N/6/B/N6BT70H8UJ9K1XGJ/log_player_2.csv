Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value this product holds, I'm willing to come down to $17500. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500.
