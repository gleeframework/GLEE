"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest level.  I'm confident that I can get at least $15,000 for the product, so this offer gives me room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still get more. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but if he rejects, I'm prepared to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to get him to go a little higher. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob before having to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

This is my final attempt to get a price closer to my ideal value before I consider selling to John.  I'm confident that Bob is close to his maximum offer, so this price should be within his range.  If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John to ensure a good return on my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price, but I've already reached round 6. There's no guarantee that we'll reach a deal in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing a sale to John.  Selling to John now guarantees me a good return, and I can always try to negotiate with Bob later if I need to."
