Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He values the product at $8,000, so $14,000 might be enough to make him think it's a good deal.
* **It's below your guaranteed sale price:** You're guaranteed $15,000 from John, so you're still getting a good price even if Bob rejects the offer. 

By starting slightly below your guaranteed price, you leave room for negotiation and potentially get closer to your ideal price."
