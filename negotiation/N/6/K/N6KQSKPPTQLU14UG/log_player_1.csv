Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range can potentially benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob some room to feel like he's getting a deal.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting significantly above Bob's valuation, but within a reasonable range.
* **Confidence:** The language conveys that you believe in the product's value.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While the message is firm, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower within the ZOPA.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a smaller margin.
