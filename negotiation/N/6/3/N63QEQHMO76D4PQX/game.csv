"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1200000 is significantly below what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, while I understand your budget constraints, $1000000 simply isn't feasible for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1600000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's make this happen.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
