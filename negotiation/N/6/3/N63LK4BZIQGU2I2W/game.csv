"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind. How about we settle on $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 might still be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $8,200?",8200.0,Alice,5,
