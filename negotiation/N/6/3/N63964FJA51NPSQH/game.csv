"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, and I'm glad you think it's a great opportunity for me. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. I believe $14000 is a fair price considering its value to me is $15000. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious investment in the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $16000 for the product. This is a compromise that still reflects its value to me, while also acknowledging your budget concerns. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to go up to $15500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm confident that this price reflects a fair value for the product, considering its worth to me is $15000. Can you consider this offer?",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're getting close to your target price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $15500. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $16200 for the product. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value it holds for you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",16200.0,Alice,5,
