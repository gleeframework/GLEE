,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $110. Let me know if that works for you!",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already invested a lot in this product, and $100 is getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $105. Let me know if that works for you!",105.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $102, so I'm counteroffering at $103.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in!",103.5,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $106. Let's see if we can meet at this price. It's a fair compromise, considering the value I know you place on this product.",106.0,Alice,9,
