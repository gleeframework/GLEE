Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've set the initial price at $150, which is above my minimum acceptable price. This allows for room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my ideal selling price.
* **Open to Offers:** By mentioning being open to reasonable offers, I'm signaling flexibility and encouraging Bob to counteroffer, potentially getting us closer to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I've used the phrase ""amazing product"" to subtly imply value without giving away too much information about my true valuation. 
* **Focus on Communication:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in a conversation, which will help me understand his interest and potential counteroffers.

This strategy is designed to maximize my potential earnings while maintaining a good relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $100 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is a substantial offer, it falls below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting would result in a loss.  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a great deal for a product like this.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've made a counteroffer of $130, which is higher than Bob's offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. This shows flexibility while still protecting my profit.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I've again emphasized the product's value by saying it's a ""great deal.""
* **Maintaining Openness:** The message is still friendly and invites Bob to continue the negotiation. This keeps the door open for further compromise. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down to $130, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my minimum acceptable price, his offer of $115 is still below my threshold of $120.  Accepting would result in a loss. 

Given that John is willing to pay $120, it makes more sense to sell the product to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob. This ensures I meet my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further concessions that could potentially lower my profit."
