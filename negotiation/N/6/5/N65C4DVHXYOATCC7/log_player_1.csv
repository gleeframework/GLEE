Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the significant value it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Understanding Value:** Knowing the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob gives you leverage. This offer aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference between what you value it at ($1,000,000) and what it's worth to him.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, it's still below what I believe we can agree on.  Bob clearly sees significant value in the product, so there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter-offer to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:**  By moving from $1,300,000 to $1,250,000, I'm showing Bob a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This common negotiation tactic aims for a compromise that feels fair to both parties.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the significant value the product holds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. How about we try $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but his pace is slowing down.  $1,225,000 is a strong offer and is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome, and I risk losing the deal entirely."
