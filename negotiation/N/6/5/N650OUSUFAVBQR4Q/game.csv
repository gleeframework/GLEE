"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your budget, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum price, and $16000 is still a bit below that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $17000. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I still need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer at $17500. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",17500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I need to be realistic about my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $18000, but I'm willing to throw in a small additional feature that wasn't included in the initial offer. This is my last counteroffer, and I hope we can meet at this price.",18000.0,Alice,7,
