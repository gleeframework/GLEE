"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, as it's a good starting point to potentially negotiate a higher price.  This price is also within a reasonable range, considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $150. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm offering $145, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still trying to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally like to get closer to $145, accepting Bob's offer of $142 is a good outcome. It's significantly higher than what I could get from John, and with only 6 rounds left, there's no guarantee I can secure a better price."
