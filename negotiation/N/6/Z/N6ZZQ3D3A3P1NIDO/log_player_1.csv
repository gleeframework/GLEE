Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Enthusiastic Tone:** A positive message might encourage Bob to be more open to the deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies I'm open to negotiation, which can keep Bob engaged. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have a backup buyer at $8,000 allows me to be more aggressive with my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $7500?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I have a backup buyer at $8,000 gives me confidence to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate you making an offer. $7,500 is a little lower than I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and I come down to $8,750? This would still be a great deal for you, and it works for me. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** Instead of rejecting outright, I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is a ""great deal"" even at my counteroffer.
* **Staying above minimum:** The counteroffer of $8,750 keeps me above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message conveys that I'm still open to discussion, encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $8750. I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $8125? It's a fair compromise and would allow me to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is acceptable:** $8,125 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While I could counter again, there's a risk that Bob might reject again or walk away.
* **Securing the deal:** Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the potential of a lost deal with Bob or having to settle for John's lower offer."
