"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $7500?  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate you making an offer. $7500 is a little lower than I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and I come down to $8750? This would still be a great deal for you, and it works for me. Let me know your thoughts!",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $8750. I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $8125? It's a fair compromise and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",8125.0,Bob,4,
