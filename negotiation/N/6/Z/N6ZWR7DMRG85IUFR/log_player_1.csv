Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with the highest possible price, as this allows me to maximize my potential profit. I know Bob values the product at $800,000, but I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price, especially since I have a guaranteed fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is a better price than Bob's initial valuation, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $950,000, which is a significant compromise, but still within my acceptable range. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I am not desperate for a sale. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $900,000 is close to my target and significantly higher than his initial offer. It would be risky to continue negotiating, as I might end up with a lower price or even lose the deal entirely. Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, but accepting Bob's offer now ensures a faster sale."
