Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $100, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more, especially if the product is something he really wants. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $175 leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob. He might try to negotiate the price down, and we can always meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** It's important to remember we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150. This means we shouldn't accept anything less than that from Bob.

**The goal is to maximize profit, and this strategy gives us the best chance of doing so while still being reasonable and potentially securing a deal with Bob.**"
