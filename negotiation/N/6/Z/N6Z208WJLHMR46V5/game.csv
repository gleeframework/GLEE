"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $11,000? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $9,000.  It's the best I can do at this time.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. This is the lowest price I can accept. If you're still interested, let's meet at $10,000. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,5,
