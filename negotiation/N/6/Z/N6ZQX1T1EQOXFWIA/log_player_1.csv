"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A $200,000 difference gives Bob room to bargain without feeling like he's getting a terrible deal.
* **Open and friendly:**  I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport and encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  His offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I'm confident I can secure a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Not risking John:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, I'm willing to risk further negotiation with Bob for the chance of a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still leaves room for a profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising, but not giving in:** I'm lowering my price, but not drastically. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I'm framing the price as a way for both of us to profit.
* **Keeping the door open:** I'm inviting further discussion by suggesting we find a ""middle ground""."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not sure $1,350,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. Would you consider $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** There's still potential to reach a better deal with Bob, even if it takes more rounds. 
* **Risk vs. reward:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, the possibility of a higher price with Bob still motivates me to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,225,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $1,350,000. Would you consider $1,300,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a profitable deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:**  I'm lowering my price slightly, showing flexibility.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and the potential for profit on both sides.
* **Focused on compromise:**  I'm emphasizing the idea of a fair price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure $1,300,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are already in round 6, and Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price.
* **No significant progress:** Bob is unwilling to budge significantly from his initial offer, and further negotiation might not yield a better result.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is my minimum target. While I might be able to get a slightly higher price with Bob, the risk of losing the deal is too high, considering the time constraint."
