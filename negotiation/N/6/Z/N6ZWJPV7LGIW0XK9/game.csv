"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll find it very useful. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $130. Could you meet me halfway at $165?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  Unfortunately, $165 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $140, which is closer to my budget and a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference again and call it $152.50?  This gets us very close to a deal, and I think it's a fair offer.",152.5,Alice,5,
