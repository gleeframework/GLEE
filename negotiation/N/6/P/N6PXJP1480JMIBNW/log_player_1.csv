Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're still getting more than your $800,000 floor.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate:**  This is important for building trust and a positive negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than your desired price. You can likely get closer to your goal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to your desired price and avoids further negotiation. While you might get slightly more by continuing, the risk of Bob walking away or you needing to sell to John for less is too high."
