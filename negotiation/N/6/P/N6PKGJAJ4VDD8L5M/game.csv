"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  However,  $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential.  I could consider coming down to $1,900,000. This is a serious offer reflecting the product's inherent value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
