"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1100000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I've placed on the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1025000. This is a significant step closer to your previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can bridge this gap.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my original price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1025000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1075000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
