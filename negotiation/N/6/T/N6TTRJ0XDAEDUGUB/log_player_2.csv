"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $1,200,000. It's a significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Let's discuss this further! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's potential to negotiate further. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is intriguing, but I'm hoping to find a better price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for Bob. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially secure a better price by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping for a better price.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers your needs and my budget. Let's try to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This price recognizes the value you'll gain from the product while still ensuring I get a fair return. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  At $975,000, Bob can secure the product for a price that's well within his budget and significantly lower than what John is offering. There's always a risk that further negotiation could result in a lower price, but the potential gains are relatively small compared to the current offer. Accepting the offer minimizes risk and allows Bob to secure the product."
