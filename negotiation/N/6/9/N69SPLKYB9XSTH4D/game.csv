"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $10,000 on this item. Would it be possible for you to adjust your offer to meet my budget?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand that you value the product highly, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $17,000 price point. Would it be possible for us to discuss a price closer to my budget, perhaps around $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $15,000 to make this worthwhile.  Would you consider $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your flexibility. Considering my budget and the value I place on this product, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my limit. How about we aim for $13,500? This price aligns better with my financial situation while still reflecting the value I see in the product.",13500.0,Bob,6,
