Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect for both of us to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, which will allow us to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a good return while ensuring I stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Leverage:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000, giving me the leverage to hold out for a better deal. 
* **Potential for compromise:**  I can likely get a higher price than Bob's offer by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still gives you a great value.  This is my final offer before I move on to other interested parties.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the ""great value"" Bob would get at this price.
* **Setting a deadline:**  By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I create a sense of urgency and pressure Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if Bob rejects my counteroffer."
