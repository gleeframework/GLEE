Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000, which still gives you a great value.  This is my final offer before I move on to other interested parties.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

*  Bob's goal is to save as much as possible, but he also doesn't want to risk losing the product to another buyer.
* By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures the product at a price that's within his budget and a better deal than buying from John."
