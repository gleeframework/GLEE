"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,000 is still above his target of $12,000, so he should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a little less. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his $8,000 limit as possible. This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's important to start with a solid counteroffer to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear lower bound."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,500 is within Bob's budget of $12,000. While it's not ideal, it's a better deal than buying from John for $12,000.  This is a good compromise that allows Bob to save money while still securing the product."
