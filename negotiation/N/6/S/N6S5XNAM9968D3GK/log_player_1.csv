"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm being friendly and confident, but not pushy, to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm holding out for a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to close the deal quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Okay Bob, I understand. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a great deal for both of us, so let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
 
I'm staying firm, but also showing flexibility by dropping the price just a bit. I'm emphasizing the win-win situation to entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $107.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I want to secure the sale before he potentially goes lower. It's a good deal for both of us, so I'm accepting."
