"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to offer you $12000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
