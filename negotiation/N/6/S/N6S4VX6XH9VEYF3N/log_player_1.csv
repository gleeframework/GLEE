Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Considering your value of $800,000, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
