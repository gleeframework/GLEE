Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not willing to pay $950,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $950,000. I'll counteroffer with a lower price than my original offer, but higher than Bob's offer, to see if we can find a middle ground."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with it. I'll counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."

Bob's offer is getting frustratingly close to John's offer. I've already compromised significantly, and I don't want to risk a protracted negotiation that might ultimately result in a lower price. I'll sell to John for $800,000, which is still a decent return."
