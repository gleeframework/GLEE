Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still a bit low, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try and get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob with a price of $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a bit more."
