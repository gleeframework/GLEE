"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  $11,500 is less than $12,000.
* **There's potential for a better deal:** You have a higher value for the product ($12,000) than Alice ($10,000). This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's $11,500, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle ground:**  It also leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to her desired value of $10,000 while still giving you a good deal. 
* **Strategic move:** By offering $10,500, you signal to Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal without immediately pushing her away with a too-low offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good:**  $11,000 is still a better price than buying from John for $12,000.
* **Limited room for improvement:**  While you might be able to negotiate further, there's a chance Alice will become less willing to budge.  It's unlikely you'll get a price significantly lower than $11,000.
* **Risk of delay:**  Negotiating further could take time, and you might risk Alice changing her mind or finding another buyer.

Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price without unnecessary risk or delay."
