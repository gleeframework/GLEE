"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth a significant amount to your business.  I'm confident this price reflects its value, but I'm open to discussing it further if you have any concerns. If you're not interested at this price, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is a bit higher than John's, it's still within Bob's budget. However, Bob can get the product for a lower price from John. Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
