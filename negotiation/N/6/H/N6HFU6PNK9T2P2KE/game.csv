"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $14000 for the product.",14000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $16000. I believe the product is worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great investment."
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to budge from $16000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a personalized setup service. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate the additional perks you're offering, but I still believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $15000 for the product.",15000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15500. I'll throw in an additional accessory that complements the product perfectly, and I'm confident it's worth the extra cost."
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $15000, but I need to get the accessories I mentioned earlier, and I'll also include a premium support package for a year. This way, you'll get the best value for your investment. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,5,,
