Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay this price, and if not, we can adjust based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $175 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm going to counter with $190. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it'll be appealing enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $180 is still a good deal.  It's more than what I'd get from John, and it seems like Bob is willing to pay that amount.  I'll avoid risking further negotiation and take this offer."
