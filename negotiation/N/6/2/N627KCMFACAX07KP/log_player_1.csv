Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, making him feel more in control of the process. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind my fallback option (John's offer of $800,000) as my absolute minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is substantial, it's significantly lower than both my initial asking price and his perceived value of the product. I believe there's room for negotiation to bridge the gap and reach a more favorable agreement. Accepting his offer now would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  This product offers you substantial value, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $875,000, I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($750,000) and my previous asking price ($950,000). This approach often feels fair to both parties and can facilitate a quicker agreement.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than my fallback option ($800,000 from John).  
* **Encouraging Agreement:** My message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution, hoping to keep the negotiation moving positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I still feel that a compromise might be beneficial for both of us. Let me propose a price of $825,000. I hope this suggestion can help us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $825,000 is a reasonable compromise. While it's not the highest price I could potentially get, it provides a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable price ($800,000 from John). Further negotiation might risk pushing Bob away entirely, potentially leaving me with a less favorable outcome."
