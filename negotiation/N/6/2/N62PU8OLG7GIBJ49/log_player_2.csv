Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to my price range, her final offer of $130 is still more than I want to spend. I can get the product for my target price of $120 from John, so it makes more sense to go with the guaranteed better deal."
