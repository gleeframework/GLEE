Round 2

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is better than selling to John for $120, it's still lower than my minimum price of $120. I'm hoping I can push Bob closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I need to get at least $135 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  I'm confident it will be worth the investment. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 135}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $125 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'm confident I can push him a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $130 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to achieve my minimum goal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway at $130, but I'm still trying to save a bit of money. I'm willing to pay $128 for the product. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $128 is only $8 less than my minimum price of $130.  It's a good compromise that allows me to sell the product at a price that is still acceptable, and with only 4 rounds left, there's a chance that I might not be able to get a better price. It's also better than selling to John for $120."
