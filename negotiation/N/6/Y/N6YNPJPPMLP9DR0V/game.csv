"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more to you than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,750 is closer to what I was hoping for, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,750. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $9,600. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",9600.0,Alice,5,
