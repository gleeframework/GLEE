"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is way too high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $60 would be fair.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $60 is significantly below the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $110 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Could you do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, to be completely transparent, I have another buyer who's prepared to pay $120 for this product. I'd much rather work out a deal with you, but I need to be realistic about its value. Could you do $100?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you have other offers, Alice, but I also have a budget I need to stick to. How about we settle at $85? That's a fair price considering.",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $85 is still lower than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, this is my final offer â€“ how about $95 and we close the deal?",95.0,Alice,7,
