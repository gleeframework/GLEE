"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe this price is still fair considering the value you mentioned, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth considerably more, and I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment for you. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1050000? This price acknowledges the value you see, while also allowing me to meet my minimum requirements. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1050000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1025000? This price takes into account the value you see in the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
