,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $13500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but $11500 is getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can do $13000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think about other interested buyers, so I want to make sure we can come to an agreement soon. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
