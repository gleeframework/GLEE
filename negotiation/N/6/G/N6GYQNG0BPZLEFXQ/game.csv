"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I put into it. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. I can offer you $10,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's close the deal, I'm ready to buy.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,250. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value and my initial asking price. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
