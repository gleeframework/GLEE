"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested. I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Since Alice is offering the product at her own value, it's not beneficial for Bob to buy from her. Rejecting her offer allows Bob to purchase from John for the same price."
