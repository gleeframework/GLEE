"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we split the difference and settle on $9000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8500? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and I'm really eager to get this product.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8500 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $8750.  This is my final offer.  I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price considering the value of this product.",8750.0,Alice,5,
