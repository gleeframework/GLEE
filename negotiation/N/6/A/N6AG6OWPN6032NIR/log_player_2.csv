"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it for $10000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate, especially since you have a fallback option with John. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we split the difference and settle on $9000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still more than you're willing to pay. There are still rounds left, so it's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get Alice to come down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and I'm really eager to get this product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8500 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $8750.  This is my final offer.  I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price considering the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $8,750 is within your budget. It's getting close to your counteroffer, and there's a chance she might not budge further. It's better to secure the product at this price than risk further negotiation and potentially end up paying more, or worse, lose the opportunity to buy it from her."
