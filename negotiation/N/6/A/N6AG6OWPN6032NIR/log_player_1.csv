"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $8,000 is my minimum, I think I can get closer to my initial offer of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8500? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and I'm really eager to get this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,500 is closer to my goal, I think I can still push for a higher price. I'm confident that I can close the deal within the remaining rounds without having to sell to John for the minimum price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $8,750.  This is my final offer.  I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 8750}
