""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. I know this would be a valuable asset to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's always beneficial to try and get a higher price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it at or below this price guarantees a sale but minimizes your profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of a sale before resorting to your guaranteed buyer."
