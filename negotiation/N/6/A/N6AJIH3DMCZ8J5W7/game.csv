"I'm interested in the product, but $1250000 is a bit too steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900000 is simply too low.  While I value our potential partnership, I need to ensure I receive a fair price.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $1075000? This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to make a reasonable profit, but $1075000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we compromise at $1025000? That way, we both get a fair deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
