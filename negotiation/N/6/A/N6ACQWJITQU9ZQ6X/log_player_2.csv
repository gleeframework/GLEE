"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but unfortunately, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,250,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,350,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price. There's still a chance Alice might be willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's work towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still not enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable deal.  Let's finalize this now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason:  Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's a chance that further negotiation could bring the price down, but with only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal is high.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
