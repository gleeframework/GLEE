"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but unfortunately, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,250,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's work towards a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still not enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable deal.  Let's finalize this now.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
