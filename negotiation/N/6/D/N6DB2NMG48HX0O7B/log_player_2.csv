"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $115, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal for him.  While further negotiation is possible, there's a risk that Alice will get more stubborn or Bob will run out of rounds and have to buy from John for $150. It's a good time to accept the offer."
