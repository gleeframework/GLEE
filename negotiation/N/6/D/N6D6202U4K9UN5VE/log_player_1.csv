Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know how valuable it is, so I'm offering it to you for $14,500. This is a limited-time offer, so don't miss out!"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's valuation leaves room for him to counter-offer while still ensuring you get a price significantly higher than your minimum ($12,000). 
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you add a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly."
