{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:**  Mentioning the product's value to Bob is a subtle way to remind him of the potential benefit, which might encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This initial offer allows for potential counteroffers and ensures the negotiation doesn't end prematurely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$8,500 is too low:** While it's above my minimum acceptable price ($8,000), it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves me with less profit than I would like. 
* **Opportunity to increase price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price, potentially securing a better deal. 
* **Not risking selling to John:**  Selling to John at this point would only get me $8,000, which is less than Bob's offer. I can risk further negotiation without losing out on a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This still leaves room for you to get a great value for this product, while also ensuring I get a fair price for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:**  $9,250 is a compromise from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product.
* **Appealing to value:**  Reiterating the product's value and how it benefits Bob is a subtle reminder of its worth, encouraging him to consider a higher price.
* **Finding middle ground:**  The offer positions this price as a ""middle ground"", implying that it's a fair solution for both parties."
