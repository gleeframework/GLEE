"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This still leaves room for you to get a great value for this product, while also ensuring I get a fair price for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is now offering the product for $9,250.
* **John's Offer:** John is selling the product for $12,000. 

Alice's offer is significantly better than John's, and it's still within Bob's budget. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $2,750 compared to buying from John.  While a lower price is always desirable, the risk of Alice rejecting a further counteroffer or having to pay John's full price is too high."
