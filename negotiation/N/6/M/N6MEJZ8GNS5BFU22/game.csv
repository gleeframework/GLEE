"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? ",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This still leaves room for you to get a great value for this product, while also ensuring I get a fair price for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9250.0,Alice,3,
