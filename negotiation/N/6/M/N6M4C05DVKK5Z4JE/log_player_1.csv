Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really like for $180. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 180}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Offering $180 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down a bit, while still ensuring you make a profit above your minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** This initial offer also helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately rejects it, you know he's likely very price-sensitive. 
 
This strategy maximizes your potential profit while considering Bob's potential response and your fallback option with John."
