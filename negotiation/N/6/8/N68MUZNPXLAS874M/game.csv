"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from what it's worth to me. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, and it would allow me to make a significant profit. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to profit from this deal.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
