"Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $120. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $180. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",180.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $180 is getting closer, I'm still only comfortable paying $150.  This product is very important to me, and I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
