"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to your business. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that's still very attractive. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from what I could potentially get elsewhere, but I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
