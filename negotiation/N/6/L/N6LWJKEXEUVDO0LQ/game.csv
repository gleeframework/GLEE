"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a nice product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $75, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll give you a deal for $100. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with it.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80, which I think is a reasonable price. Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to meet you at $92. It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,7,
