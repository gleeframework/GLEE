Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I think this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. This information is incredibly valuable.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to maximize your profit, and selling to Bob allows for a much higher price than your backup offer from John ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:**  By framing the offer around the ""value"" the product brings to Bob's business, you create a stronger argument for the high price."
