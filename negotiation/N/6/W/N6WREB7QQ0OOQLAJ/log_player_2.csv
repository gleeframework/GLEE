"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be fair to propose a price of $950,000 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. Bob wants to save as much money as possible. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  There's no need to jump to John's offer right away, as Alice might be willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it. This offer reflects a significant price point that I believe is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. By offering $750,000, Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while also aiming for a significant discount.  This offer is still within his budget and is considerably lower than Alice's initial offer, giving her room to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and respect your valuation of our product. In light of this, we're proposing a new price of $875,000 for the item. This amount aims to bridge the gap between our initial offer and your counteroffer while still ensuring a reasonable profit for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, but $875,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price. It's worthwhile to continue negotiating and see if Alice is willing to drop the price further.  There's still room for a compromise without resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers the value of your product and my budget.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's minimum price while still maintaining a significant discount.  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while also trying to secure a price that is closer to his goal."
