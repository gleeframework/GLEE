"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it. This offer reflects a significant price point that I believe is fair for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers the value of your product and my budget.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point.",800000.0,Bob,4,
