"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, recognizing the value you see in the product.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,250,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 still falls short of what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, demonstrating my commitment to finding a solution.  This offer is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's reach an agreement in this round.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm not going any higher. I'm starting to think that this product is not worth more than $1,200,000 to me, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Let's see if we can meet on this number.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
