Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a significant opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe I can still get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, recognizing the value you see in the product.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,250,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation. There are still several rounds left, and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 still falls short of what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, demonstrating my commitment to finding a solution.  This offer is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm not going any higher. I'm starting to think that this product is not worth more than $1,200,000 to me, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Let's see if we can meet on this number. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already compromised several times, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that meets my needs.  I'm confident that John will be happy to buy the product for $1,500,000.  I'd rather take the guaranteed sale than risk losing out on a much higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
