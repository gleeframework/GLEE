"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However,  $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $9500, which is a compromise between our initial offers. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $7500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $7500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you a price of $8500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $8500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Let's meet in the middle at $8000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,6,
