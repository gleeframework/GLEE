"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $950000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value you mentioned, and it allows us to both get a good deal. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
