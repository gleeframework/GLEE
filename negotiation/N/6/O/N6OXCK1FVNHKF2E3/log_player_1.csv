"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value of the product. This maximizes my potential profit while leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, giving me an opportunity to gauge his seriousness and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering with $13,500. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation process. Accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids the risk of a further stalemate or having to sell to John for a lower price."
