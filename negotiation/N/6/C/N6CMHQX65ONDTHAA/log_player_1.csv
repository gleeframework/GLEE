Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your limits:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less than that.
* **Maximizing profit:** Offering the product to Bob slightly below your minimum allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit margin than John's offer.
* **Strategic positioning:** By presenting the offer as exclusive and highlighting the product's value, you create a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he rejects it.

This approach balances your desire for maximum profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
