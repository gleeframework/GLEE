"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

You can get the product from John for $150, so accepting Alice's offer for $140 would still save you money.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, you should reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
