"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $15000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $18000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $17500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16000, but I'm starting to think that buying from John for $12000 might be a better option for me. Can you consider meeting me at $16000 or lower?",16000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're considering buying from John, Bob, but I'd rather not lose the sale to him. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll include a free premium service that's worth $2000. So, the total value you'll get is $18000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",16000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the free premium service, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $16000. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, and I'm willing to consider the premium service as part of the deal. Can you accept this price?",14000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you at $15000, but I'll throw in the premium service again, just like I did in the last round. This way, you'll get the product and the premium service for $15000. I think it's a fair deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",15000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the premium service, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $15000. I'm willing to meet you at $13500, and I'm willing to consider the premium service as part of the deal. I think this is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal here.",13500.0,Bob,10,
