Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and open to negotiation.
* **Opportunity:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for both of us, highlighting the potential benefit for Bob. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum, leaving room for a counteroffer.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  Bob's response will indicate his level of interest and potential for further negotiation.
* **Maintain control:** If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, and always have the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While it's tempting to take it and get some money, it's not a good deal for me.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting Bob's offer means losing $5,000, which is a substantial amount.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm confident in the value of my product and my negotiation skills.
* **Safety Net:**  Even if I reject Bob's offer, I have the backup option of selling to John for $15,000, so I'm not taking a huge risk.

**Next Steps:** 

I will counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to $12,000. I'll use the opportunity to highlight the value of the product and potentially offer a small concession to incentivize Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500 to make this deal work. It's still a fair price, and I believe you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a small concession from my initial $12,000 offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and reiterating that my price is still fair, even with the concession.
* **Building Momentum:**  By framing the offer as an opportunity to ""make this deal work,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Close the gap:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Show commitment:**  My willingness to compromise shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation if Bob still rejects, but I'm not giving away too much ground too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. This aligns closely with what I am able to afford at this time. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistent Rejection:**  Bob has repeatedly rejected my offers, demonstrating that he's unlikely to budge much further.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is consuming valuable time, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price. 
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While selling to John means losing out on potentially more profit, it's still a better outcome than accepting Bob's low offer and losing a significant amount of money.

**Conclusion:**

By selling to John, I'm securing a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum requirement.  While I may have hoped to get a higher price from Bob, continuing to negotiate would have been risky and potentially unprofitable.  It's better to move on and secure the deal with a reliable buyer."
