"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",14500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for something closer to $14,000. How about we split the difference and go with $13,750?  It's a fair price for both of us.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for $14,000, but $13,750 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,250.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500.  This would give us both a good deal. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,5,
