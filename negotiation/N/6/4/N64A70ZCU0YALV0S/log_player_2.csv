"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $95 is within your budget, it's not the best deal. You can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  You're willing to pay up to $100, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is coming down in price, which is a good sign. However,  $90 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with. There's still room for negotiation, and you're willing to pay up to $100, so you can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $90 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $88.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 88}
