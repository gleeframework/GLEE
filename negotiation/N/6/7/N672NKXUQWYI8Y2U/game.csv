"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $850,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price.  Let's meet closer to the middle. How about $900,000? This recognizes the value you've highlighted while still reflecting a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to meet you at $900,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $880,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider this price?",880000.0,Bob,4,
