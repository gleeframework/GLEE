"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer makes sense in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. 
* **Within Budget:** $9,500 is within Bob's budget and leaves some room for Alice to compromise without losing too much.
* **Open to Compromise:** The message emphasizes a desire to find a mutually agreeable price, fostering a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This still leaves some room for profit for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his ideal price point. Bob is determined to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for further negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering again allows Bob to try and push the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer represents a small increase from Bob's previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Staying Within Budget:** $9,750 remains comfortably within Bob's budget.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive tone and reiterates a desire for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still too far from what the product is worth to me. Let's try $10,250. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to save as much as possible.  While $10,250 is getting closer to his ideal price, he can likely still push for a better deal. It's a good time to counter-offer and see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still a bit outside of my budget. How about $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this figure."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This counteroffer is a significant move toward Alice's offer, showing Bob's willingness to compromise. 
* **Almost at Budget:**  $10,000 is very close to Bob's ideal price point.
* **Positive and Finalizing:** The message emphasizes a desire to close the deal and implies that Bob might be willing to accept this offer."
