,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This still leaves some room for profit for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still too far from what the product is worth to me. Let's try $10,250. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still a bit outside of my budget. How about $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this figure.",10000.0,Bob,6,
