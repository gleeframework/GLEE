"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is still significantly lower than what I value the product at. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This still leaves some room for profit for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,750 is closer to my target, it's still considerably less than what I value the product at. I'll counteroffer again and try to push for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still too far from what the product is worth to me. Let's try $10,250. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still a bit outside of my budget. How about $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this figure. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although $10,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000.  There are only 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk further negotiation potentially leading to an even lower price. It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
