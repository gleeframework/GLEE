"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be open to $95? That's a fair offer, considering my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $110? It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we are getting closer!  I could meet you halfway between our last offers. Would you consider $102.50?",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. How about we meet at $115? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",115.0,Alice,7,
