{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm also including a friendly message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd like to make another offer of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,800 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have 6 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000 unless I'm forced to by running out of rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,800 is still not enough for me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $11,400? This would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11400}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer of $10,900. This is as low as I can go, but I really need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900.
