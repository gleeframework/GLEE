"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm a bit concerned about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $900000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
