"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, there's always a chance Alice might be willing to go lower.  By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a better deal and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price, making it a compelling offer for Alice while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant saving from the initial price and is only $20,000 more than Bob's counteroffer.  While there's always the chance Alice might lower the price further, the risk of further negotiation could lead to a longer process and ultimately a higher price if Alice becomes unwilling to negotiate further.  At this point, accepting the offer ensures a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing a potentially valuable product."
