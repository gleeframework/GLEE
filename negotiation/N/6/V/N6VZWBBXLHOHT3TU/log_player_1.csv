Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $115?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $115 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
