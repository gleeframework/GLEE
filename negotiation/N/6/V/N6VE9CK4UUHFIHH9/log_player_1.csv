""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This offer reflects a considerable discount compared to what I'd accept elsewhere. Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's an opportunity to potentially earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price slightly below our guaranteed sale price ($1,200,000) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob, should he counter-offer. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale with Bob."
