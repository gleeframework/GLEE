"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $15000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price before accepting or resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $15,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13500.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is a good price for the product.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your counteroffer and you'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price. It's best to accept this offer and secure the product for a good price."
