"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while. With that said, I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've seen in similar products. Can you consider this offer?",875000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value is worth a bit more. I'm willing to sell it to you for $925000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $925000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $900000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think the product's value is worth a bit more. I'm willing to sell it to you for $915000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.",915000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $915000 is the best price for me. I've already gone up to $900000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm going to have to pass on this offer and explore other options. I'll consider buying the product from John for $800000 instead.",800000.0,Bob,6,
