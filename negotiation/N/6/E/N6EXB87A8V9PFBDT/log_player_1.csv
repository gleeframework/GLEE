Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will reveal how interested he is and give you a sense of his price sensitivity. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob."
