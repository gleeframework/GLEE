"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be selling it to John for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $12,500
* **Your Value:** $15,000
* **John's Price:** $15,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $2,500 compared to buying from John. While you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, it's a good deal given your maximum budget and the fact that John is also offering the product for the same price."
