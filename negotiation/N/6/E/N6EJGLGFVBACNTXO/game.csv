"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits I'll receive from the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This offer reflects the product's true value.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $15,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget of $10,000. Can we meet at this price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
