"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $13,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is higher than her value for the product ($12,000) but lower than your maximum price ($15,000). There's room for negotiation to get a better deal. Buying from John at $15,000 would be a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a little too high for me. Could you do $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($12,000). 
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed positively, expressing interest while also clearly stating your price limit. This leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the initial counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $12,500? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we can likely do better. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about a lower price without being overly aggressive.  There's still a decent margin between her offer and our fallback option of John."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $12,000? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counter-offer splits the difference between your last offer ($11,000) and her current one ($12,500). 
* **Signaling a Limit:** By offering $12,000, you're matching Alice's estimated value for the product. This suggests you're getting close to your limit and encourages her to accept. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Phrases like ""ready to close the deal"" add a touch of urgency, potentially prompting Alice to accept before you reconsider."
