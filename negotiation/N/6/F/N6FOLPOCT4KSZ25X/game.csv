"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a price significantly below its market value.  I understand its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. This represents a substantial savings for you and a fair deal for me. Consider this a one-time opportunity to acquire this product at a price you can't refuse.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
