Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000.

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below John's price. She's already made several concessions, and we're only $5,000 away from John's offer. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, potentially reaching a stalemate, and losing out on the guaranteed price from John."
