"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm proposing a price of $95 for it. This price not only reflects the worth of the product but also allows us to cover our costs and maintain a fair profit margin. I understand the value you place on this product is $80, but I hope you'll consider the additional benefits and enhancements we provide. Looking forward to your positive response.",95.0,Alice,1,
