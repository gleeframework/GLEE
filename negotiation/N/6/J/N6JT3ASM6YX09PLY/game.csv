"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. That's my top price for this product.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? This gives you a great price and allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $110. How about we meet at $105? That's the lowest I'm willing to pay.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $107.50. This is a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $105. I'm willing to meet you at that price. Can we do business at $105?",105.0,Bob,6,
