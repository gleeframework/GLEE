"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration of its value, I believe it would be fair to propose a price of $15000 for it. This reflects not only its current market value but also the potential benefits it could bring to your business. I look forward to your response.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and potential benefits of the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
