"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to sell now, I'm going to reject and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering with $90. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but a bit closer to meeting him halfway.  I'm hoping he'll be willing to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my desired price, I'm going to reject again. I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $90. There are still 6 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm coming down a bit further to $85. I'm hoping that this is a good compromise, given Bob's consistent offers below my desired price. I believe this is a fair price that will be more appealing to Bob while still staying above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's best to accept this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiations failing.  The remaining rounds could result in a lower price, and selling to John guarantees me $80."
