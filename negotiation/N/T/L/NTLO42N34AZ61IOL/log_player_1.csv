Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,500,000 (anything less and you're better off with John).
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Your Advantage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's below his perceived value) but also maximizes your profit.  Since you have a backup offer, you can afford to start higher.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing exclusivity and value.
* **Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's:
    * Significantly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000).
    * Gives you a $150,000 profit over your minimum.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. He may counter-offer.  You have some room to lower the price slightly, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While John is your backup, mentioning other interested parties could strengthen your position. 
* **Confident Demeanor:**  Approach the negotiation with confidence. Your backup offer gives you leverage. 

Let me know if you'd like to explore alternative scenarios or if Bob comes back with a counter-offer!"
