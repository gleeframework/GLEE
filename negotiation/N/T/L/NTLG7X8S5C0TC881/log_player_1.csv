This offer starts the negotiation high, leaving room for potential compromise. It's important to remember that I value the product at $1,000,000, so I'm aiming to get significantly more.  I'll need to analyze Bob's response to determine my next move."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
