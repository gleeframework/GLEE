"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be open to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $13,000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
