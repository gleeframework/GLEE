Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price. It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there is a considerable potential for a deal that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. There's a good chance I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, considering he values the product at $1,500,000. I'll try to find a middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, and it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a respectable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. There's no guarantee I'll get a higher offer, but the potential reward outweighs the risk of settling for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a final attempt to find a middle ground with Bob. It's closer to his offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise, but still offers a substantial profit margin. If he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to move on and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price point, Bob's final offer of $900,000 is only slightly higher than John's offer of $800,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing out on a guaranteed sale. I'll sell the product to John and avoid further risk."
