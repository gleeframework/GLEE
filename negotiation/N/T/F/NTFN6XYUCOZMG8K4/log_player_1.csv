Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, he's unlikely to go above his perceived value of $80. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $100. It makes more sense to take the sure profit now than risk Bob not budging and potentially getting stuck with a lower offer or no deal at all."
