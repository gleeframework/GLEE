{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build a rapport with Bob by expressing my belief in the product's value for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only able to pay $125 right now.  Would you be willing to go down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $125 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher offer. It's worth it to try and get a little closer to my target price of $150. I'll counter-offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to go up to $130? That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really interested in the product, but I'm still limited to $128. It's the most I can do right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $128 is still a little below my ideal price, it's a good compromise and a better deal than selling to John.  I'm happy to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
