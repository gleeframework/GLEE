"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is my final offer as this product is highly valuable to me.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $12,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
