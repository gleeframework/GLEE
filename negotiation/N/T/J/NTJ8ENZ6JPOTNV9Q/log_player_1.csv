{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to emphasize that I'm not being unreasonable. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest while potentially getting a better price than my minimum. If he rejects, I can adjust my counteroffers based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob has expressed interest, I believe there's room to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fall apart, I can still sell to John for $15,000, which is better than Bob's current offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and attempt to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  I think this price reflects the value of the product and is still fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Rationale:**  I'm offering a counter-offer that is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still a significant discount from my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility while showing that I'm not willing to settle for a price that is too low.
* **Focus on Value & Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the fairness of the proposed price, hoping to persuade Bob.
* **Middle Ground:**  Offering a ""middle ground"" price can be perceived as a compromise and may be more appealing than a strict ""take it or leave it"" approach.

This counter-offer aims to find a common ground while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $14,000 is closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still not ideal.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, suggesting that there's still room to push for a slightly higher price.
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is still a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and attempt to get a price closer to my minimum.  It's a calculated risk, but the potential for a slightly higher price outweighs the risk of settling for a lower one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $14,000 is very close to my minimum, but I'm still willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,500? This would be a fair price that respects both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm offering a small compromise, splitting the difference between my minimum and Bob's last offer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a price close to my desired range.
* **Focus on Fairness & Needs:**  I'm reiterating the fairness of the proposed price and emphasizing that it addresses both our needs. This can be persuasive, especially if Bob is genuinely interested in the product.
* **Pressure to Close:**  By offering a compromise and stressing fairness, I'm subtly pressuring Bob to make a decision and avoid further delays.

This counter-offer aims to reach a compromise and potentially secure a price that's closer to my minimum while still keeping negotiations open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $14500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Near My Minimum:** Bob's offer is $1,500 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Limited Upside:** While there's some room to negotiate further, it's likely Bob's budget is truly constrained. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees my minimum and eliminates the risk of further negotiation. 

While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, the potential for further negotiation is limited, and selling to John guarantees my minimum value and avoids the risk of an even lower offer from Bob."
