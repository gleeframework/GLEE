"I'm excited to offer you the product for sale. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,500,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking for a better price.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,200,000, but I can also offer a compromise at $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a lower price.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,125,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,200,000, but I can also offer a compromise at $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind. I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
