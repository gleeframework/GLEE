Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,200,000, but I can also offer a compromise at $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,200,000, but I can also offer a compromise at $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind. I'm not willing to go any lower than this.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is getting close to my ideal price of $1,050,000. While I'd prefer to pay less, accepting this offer saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John. It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to get a lower price altogether."
