,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price point is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,200,000? I think that's fair and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  Let's find a compromise. How about we settle on $1,550,000?  This price reflects the product's worth while remaining competitive. ",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I agree $1,200,000 was a bit low,  $1,550,000 is still more than I had budgeted.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  But $1,375,000 is still significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1,450,000.  This offer represents a fair value for both of us, and gives you a great deal on a valuable product.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right that we're getting close. This product would be a great asset for me, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value.  $1,400,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I can't go lower than $1,425,000.  This would represent a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1425000.0,Alice,7,
