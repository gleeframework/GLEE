Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price point is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,200,000? I think that's fair and would allow us to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
