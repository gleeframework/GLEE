"Alice, $2000000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $500000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500000 is simply too low.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for some flexibility on your end.  What do you say?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1750000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to go up to $700000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700000 is still far below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000 as a final compromise.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1250000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to offer $900000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  This is a fair price that allows for some profit for you and stays within my budget. Let's reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $900000 is getting closer, but it's still below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to go down to $1000000 to finalize this deal.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good investment for you.  Let's make it happen!",1000000.0,Alice,7,
