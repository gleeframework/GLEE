"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This reflects the value you've stated for the product, and it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still leaves some room for profit for both of us. This is a fair compromise, let's see if we can agree.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is a significant offer and shows my commitment to making a deal.  Let's close this now!",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a very fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that we can both be happy with. Let's seal the deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you want to get the best price possible, and I respect that. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, but that's my final offer. If you accept, we can close the deal now. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",910000.0,Bob,6,
