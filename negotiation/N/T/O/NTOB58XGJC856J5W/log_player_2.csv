# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am willing to consider your offer. In light of our discussion, I would like to counter with a price of $1100000 for the product. This is my best offer given the value it holds for both of us.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it gives you a respectable price and gives me a chance to acquire a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. My best offer for the product is now $1075000. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable to you while still providing a fair return for our product.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is getting very close to your counteroffer of $1,050,000.  Since you only have 5 rounds left, it's worth accepting this offer.  You've saved a significant amount of money compared to your original budget and John's price, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better outcome within the remaining rounds."
