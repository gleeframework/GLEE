"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $900,000}

I'm starting with a price that is slightly higher than my minimum price of $800,000, but still relatively close to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate and see if he's willing to make a move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $700,000 because it's below my minimum price of $800,000. I'd rather not sell the product at a loss, and I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob. I'll send a counteroffer to try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $850,000}

I'm increasing my price by $150,000 from my initial offer, trying to get closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000. I'm still below Bob's previous offer of $700,000, so I'm hoping to find a sweet spot where Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $750,000 again, as it's still below my minimum price of $800,000. I'm not willing to sell the product at a loss, and I think I can get a better price from Bob. I'll send another counteroffer to try to get closer to my target price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $800,000}

I'm setting my price at my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm hoping that Bob will finally meet me at this price, as it's already lower than his previous offer of $775,000. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider selling the product to John for $800,000."
