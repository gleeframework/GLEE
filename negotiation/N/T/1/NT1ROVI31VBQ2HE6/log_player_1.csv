**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, the potential gains from continuing the negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the guaranteed $1,200,000 offer from John. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale."
