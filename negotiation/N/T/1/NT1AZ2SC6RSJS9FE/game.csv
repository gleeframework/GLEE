"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $825,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I would be happy to finalize the purchase.",800000.0,Bob,4,
