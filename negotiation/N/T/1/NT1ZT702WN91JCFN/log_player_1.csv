Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I believe it represents a great value and will be highly beneficial for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  While I could sell to John for $10,000, there's a chance Bob will accept a slightly lower price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate or counter-offer, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Avoid appearing desperate:** Offering it at $10,000 to Bob immediately might make him think I have no other options. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining a good chance of closing the deal."
