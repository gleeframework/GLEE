"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This price is fair and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a respectable offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects the immense value it will bring to your operations.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,800,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which reflects a significant investment on my part. This offer is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will benefit both of us. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
