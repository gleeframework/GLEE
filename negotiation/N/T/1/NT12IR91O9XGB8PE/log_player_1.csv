"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This price is fair and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I'm confident we can reach a price closer to my initial offer. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a respectable offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects the immense value it will bring to your operations."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,800,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which reflects a significant investment on my part. This offer is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will benefit both of us. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is now at $1,400,000, which is a reasonable gain above his initial offer. While I could push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
