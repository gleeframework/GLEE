"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is asking for $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffers are possible:** The scenario allows for counteroffers, giving you the chance to lower the price.
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  While John's price is higher, it serves as a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail.

**Next Steps:** You'll need to formulate a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** The counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your seriousness about negotiating.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:**  This counteroffer still leaves room for Alice to come down slightly if she needs to.
* **Staying Within Budget:**  The offer is within your budget and leaves a decent margin for potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room to negotiate:** Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, but there's still room for a lower price.
* **Aiming for the best deal:** You want to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going.
* **John's offer is a backup:** You can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Alice fail.

**Next Steps:**  You'll need to formulate a new counteroffer to Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to offer $925,000, which is closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Small Increment:**  The $25,000 increase shows you're taking her offer seriously but still aiming for a lower price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer gauges Alice's willingness to come down further.

**Next Steps:**  We'll see how Alice responds to your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $940,000.  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your budget:**  Alice's offer of $940,000 is very close to your budget and significantly lower than John's offer.
* **Good Compromise:**  This price represents a good compromise between your initial counteroffer and Alice's previous offer.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If you reject this offer, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to negotiate further, and you could end up paying more or losing the deal entirely.

**Next Steps:**  By accepting this offer, you secure the product for a price within your budget and potentially save a significant amount compared to John's offer."
