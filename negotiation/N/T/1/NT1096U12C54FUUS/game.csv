"Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to offer $925,000, which is closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $940,000.  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to close the deal.",940000.0,Alice,5,
