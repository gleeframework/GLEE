{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to make at least $120, and $115 is still a good profit.
* **It's below John's offer:** You don't want to immediately lose out on John's guaranteed sale.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum desired profit. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to your target of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $105 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $105. Would you be willing to consider $108? It's a bit closer to your asking price, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $108 is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum profit margin of $120. Since you have a guaranteed sale with John for $120, it's wiser to accept his offer and ensure your minimum profit.  Further negotiation with Bob might lead to a lower price, risking a loss."
