"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is already a very competitive price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

```
While I could push for a bit more, accepting $11,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly more than my minimum ($8,000) and Bob seems quite interested. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk him walking away.
