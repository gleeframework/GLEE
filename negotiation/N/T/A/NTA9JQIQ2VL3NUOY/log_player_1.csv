"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity with significant potential value. I'm confident you'll see the benefit in this investment."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High initial offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation and ensures you're getting the best possible price.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Highlighting the product's potential helps Bob see the worth and encourages him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for counter-offers:**  $1,000,000 is a significant number, but it's not completely out of reach, leaving space for Bob to make a counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. As the negotiation progresses, we'll need to adjust our strategy based on Bob's responses and our understanding of his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than our minimum:**  $850,000 is below our minimum threshold of $800,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While we won't accept $850,000, Bob's interest in the product shows that a deal might be reached with further negotiation.
* **We have 8 rounds left:** We have time to try and get a better offer from Bob. 

We'll counter Bob's offer in the next round with a slightly lower price but still above our minimum. This will show flexibility while maintaining our value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below my desired price point.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the product's unique value and offers a fair compromise.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility by lowering our price, but it remains above our minimum threshold.
* **Emphasize value:**  We continue to reiterate the product's unique value to justify the price.
* **Fairness:**  We frame the counteroffer as a compromise to encourage Bob to see it as a reasonable solution. 

We'll carefully observe Bob's response to gauge his true interest and adjust our strategy accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to our minimum:** $900,000 is very close to our minimum threshold of $800,000. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:** We've already gone through 4 rounds, and there are only 6 left. It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers and potentially lose out on a good deal. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  We can still try to get a slightly higher price from Bob in future rounds, but $900,000 is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation.

While it's not our ideal price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of going through all 10 rounds only to end up selling to John for a lower price."
