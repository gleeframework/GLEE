``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This price is higher than my minimum threshold of $100, and leaves some room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, I'm hoping he'll find this offer reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
