"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm looking to sell. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $140? I'm really interested in this product, but that's my top limit.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $150? That's my absolute limit, and it's a fair price for both of us. ",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $150 is your absolute limit, but I'm not willing to give up on the extra $5 just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $155. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
