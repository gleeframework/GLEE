"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it, which is still a fair price given the potential return on investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your offer is a considerable investment, the value of this product is truly unique and  $1,800,000 is a much more accurate reflection of its potential. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes both its worth and your interest.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,650,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's potential while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
