Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair offer:** It's above Bob's perceived value, but below your minimum. This gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's friendly:** It establishes a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **It's clear:** It explicitly states the price you're offering.

Remember, the goal is to get as close to your $150 minimum as possible while still securing a sale. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum.  While you want to make a deal, you can't afford to sell for $100.  It's best to counteroffer and try to get a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
