"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?  That would be my final offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
