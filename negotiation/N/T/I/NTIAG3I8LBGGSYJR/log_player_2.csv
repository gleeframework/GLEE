Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,500 and at this point, it's better to secure the known price from John.  Why risk further negotiation for a small potential saving?"
