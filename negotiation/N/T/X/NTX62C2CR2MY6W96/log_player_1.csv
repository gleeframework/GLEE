Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 2200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and even your minimum, you set a high anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price gives you ample room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a price well above both Bob's valuation and your minimum.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,500,000 gives you a strong position. You can afford to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to keep it under $800,000.  Would you consider an offer in that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum price and his own perceived value. Accepting would be a substantial loss. It's clear there's a large gap to bridge, but walking away immediately might not be the best strategy yet. A counteroffer allows you to gauge his willingness to negotiate upwards."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, my initial price reflects the true value of this product and the potential it holds. While I'm open to negotiation, $500,000 is significantly below its worth.  Could you consider a more reasonable offer closer to $2,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** Lowering the price by $200,000 shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong stance. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  By emphasizing the product's value again, you aim to steer Bob away from his low initial offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge Bob's flexibility. A willingness to move substantially upwards from his offer would indicate room for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a firm budget. I can go up to $600,000, but that's absolutely my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Progress:** Bob's offer has increased, but it's still significantly below your minimum of $1,500,000 and even further from your desired profit.  
* **""Firm Budget"" Signal:**  Bob stating his ""absolute limit"" suggests his flexibility might be limited.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed sale at your desired minimum, eliminating uncertainty and potential for further low offers from Bob.

It's unlikely Bob will dramatically increase his offer to a level acceptable to you. Cutting your losses and selling to John is the most rational decision at this point."
