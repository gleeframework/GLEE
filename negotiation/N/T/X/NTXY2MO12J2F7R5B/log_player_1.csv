Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $22,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation Isn't Realistic:**  In a real negotiation, you wouldn't know Bob's true maximum valuation ($8,000).  
* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher offer than you're willing to accept. This allows room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob counters, there's space to negotiate down and still potentially secure a price higher than John's offer.

**Important:** While I've provided a starting point, successful negotiation involves reading the other party's reactions, adjusting your approach, and potentially making counteroffers."
