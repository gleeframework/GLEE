"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* While $9,000 is better than $10,000, there's room for negotiation. 
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible. 
* $8,500 is a reasonable counteroffer, considering the product is worth $8,000 to Alice. 
* This offer leaves room for Alice to counter, but it's a significant step closer to Bob's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,200 is still a better deal than buying from John for $10,000.
* While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will walk away or offer a worse price in the next round.
* Accepting the offer guarantees Bob gets the product at a price below his maximum budget."
