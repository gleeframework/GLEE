This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **You're getting a discount:** You're buying the product for $50,000 less than John's price and $250,000 less than Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Alice has signaled this is her lowest price. If you push further and she walks away, you'll end up paying John's full price. 

While you could try for a slightly lower price, the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether."
