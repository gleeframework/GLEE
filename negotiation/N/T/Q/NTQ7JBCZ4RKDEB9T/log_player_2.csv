"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to start by rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to move significantly from my initial asking price,  how about we meet halfway at $1,750,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'll counteroffer again, but it's getting close to the point where buying from John might be the better option."
