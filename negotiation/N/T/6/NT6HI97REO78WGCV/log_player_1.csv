Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm asking for $1,999,999. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1999999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  I start with a very high price ($1,999,999) to establish a strong anchor. This makes Bob's perception of value more flexible. Even if he counters, the negotiation is likely to stay in a higher range.
* **Sense of Urgency & Exclusivity:** The message implies that this is a special opportunity for Bob and that the product is highly sought after (even though I have a guaranteed buyer).

**Why this strategy?**

While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay significantly more due to:

* **Perceived Value:** Bob might see even more value in the product than I do. 
* **Fear of Loss:** The fear of missing out on a good deal can be a powerful motivator.

By anchoring high, I aim to maximize my potential profit. If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on selling to John at my minimum acceptable price."
