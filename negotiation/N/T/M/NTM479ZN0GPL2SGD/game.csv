"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. My initial offer is $1,100,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm interested in working with you to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, as that's the maximum I can afford right now.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I have to consider the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. My counteroffer is $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but it's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm really eager to get this product, and I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $900,000, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. My next counteroffer is $925,000.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $925,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a bit more than $910,000 to make this worth my while. My next counteroffer is $920,000.",920000.0,Alice,7,
