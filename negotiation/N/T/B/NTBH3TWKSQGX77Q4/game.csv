"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $120? That's still a great price for a product you value at that amount. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. Can we meet in the middle?",108.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting closer. I'm willing to drop my price to $112, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying this product, let's make a deal. ",112.0,Alice,7,
