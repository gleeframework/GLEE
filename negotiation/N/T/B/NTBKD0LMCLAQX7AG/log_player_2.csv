"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  This is a great price considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $11,500 is still above his target price of $12,000.  He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $11,000? This is still a great price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price lower than $12,000.  $11,000 is still a bit too high.  He should reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750.  This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $10,875.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it also allows me to make a profit.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's target:**  $10,875 is just a little bit above Bob's target of $10,000.
* **Time is a factor:**  Bob only has 10 rounds to make a deal.  There's a chance that if he rejects, Alice will come back with an even higher counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that he could end up paying more than $10,875 or even having to buy from John for $12,000.  Accepting this offer provides a good deal within the budget."
