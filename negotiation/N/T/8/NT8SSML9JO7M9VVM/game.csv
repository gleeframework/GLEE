"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I have in mind. To find a middle ground, how about we consider $8,800?",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $8,800 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
