Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $150, I don't want to go lower than that.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and I can still accept a price higher than my minimum.
* **Appear Reasonable:** While I could start higher, a price of $145 seems more reasonable and might make Bob more likely to engage in negotiation."
