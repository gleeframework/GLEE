{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** This gives him some room to negotiate but still allows for a good profit for you.
* **It's below your minimum:** You leave some room to accept a counteroffer without going below your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This focuses Bob's attention on the offer and encourages a quick response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'm looking for in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even below his own valuation of $1,200,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** While I'm not happy with his offer, it still indicates that he's interested in the product. 
* **Selling to John is an option:** I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my desired price point, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 to make this deal work. This is still a good price for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to compromise but still maintain a substantial profit.
* **Appeal to value:** I emphasize the good price for Bob, reminding him of the product's worth.
* **Urgency:** I subtly suggest a sense of urgency by saying ""Let's meet in the middle and make this happen,"" hoping to encourage a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,325,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is just slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, there's always a risk of Bob walking away completely.
* **Time factor:** The negotiation process is taking longer than I anticipated, and I'm concerned about potentially losing John as a buyer.

**Conclusion:**  It's a good deal for me considering the circumstances. I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
