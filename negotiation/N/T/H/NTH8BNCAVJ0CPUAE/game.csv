"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a significant price difference, but I'm really interested in the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a significant value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $975,000? It's a fair price for both of us, don't you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,012,500? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,012,500. How about we try $980,000? It's a small concession from my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  How about $1,000,000? This is a price that reflects the value of the product to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
