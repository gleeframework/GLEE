"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will benefit your business. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $900000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

However, considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875000.
