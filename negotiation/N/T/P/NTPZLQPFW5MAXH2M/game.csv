"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  This is a fair price given its value to you, and it leaves some room for us both to be satisfied.  Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am unable to meet the price of $1,750,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,250,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint.  However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to meet you halfway. This price still allows for a good profit for me, while remaining within a range that's likely beneficial for you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, I am still unable to meet the price of $1,600,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,400,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is closer to what you're looking for.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in your offer.  However, $1,400,000 is still not enough for me to part with the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This price is my absolute bottom line, and it's a price that John is also willing to pay.  Let's close this deal before I lose the opportunity to sell to him.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your patience and understanding. I've reviewed my budget constraints once again, and I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. This offer is my final proposal, and I hope it aligns better with your needs.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
