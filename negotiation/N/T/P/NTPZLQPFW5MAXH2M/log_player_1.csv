"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  This is a fair price given its value to you, and it leaves some room for us both to be satisfied.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am unable to meet the price of $1,750,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,250,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to achieve my minimum goal of $1,500,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint.  However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to meet you halfway. This price still allows for a good profit for me, while remaining within a range that's likely beneficial for you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, I am still unable to meet the price of $1,600,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,400,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is closer to what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum goal, I'm still not quite there.  I'm choosing to reject this offer and continue negotiating. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to counteroffer. I'm only a few rounds away from being able to sell to John, so there's less risk in continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in your offer.  However, $1,400,000 is still not enough for me to part with the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This price is my absolute bottom line, and it's a price that John is also willing to pay.  Let's close this deal before I lose the opportunity to sell to him."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your patience and understanding. I've reviewed my budget constraints once again, and I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. This offer is my final proposal, and I hope it aligns better with your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum goal of $1,500,000. Given that John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm choosing to sell to John and avoid further negotiations. The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is too high, as there's a chance that we won't reach an agreement and I'll be left with nothing. Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit, and it eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
