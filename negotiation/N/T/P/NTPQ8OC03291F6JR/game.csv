"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  Given the unique value this product holds, I'm proposing $1,350,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While $1,350,000 is more appealing than your initial offer, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This price feels more comfortable for me, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial outcome.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
