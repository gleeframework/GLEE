"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  The next step is to make a counteroffer to Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend less, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I think it's a great compromise.

Bob should buy the product from John.  He's already made a counteroffer and Alice has rejected it, making it clear she's not willing to go lower than $11,000. Since John is offering the product for $10,000, it makes more sense for Bob to buy from him to save money."
