Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $12,000 is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, making it a more appealing offer to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a rapport with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I will assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worthwhile to continue negotiating.
* If Bob accepts, I've successfully sold the product at a profitable price.
* If negotiations stall, I can always walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it demonstrates his interest in the product. This opens the door for further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is the fallback option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed buyer in John, allowing me to secure my minimum desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range. This will allow me to explore the possibility of a compromise while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still offers you a good deal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Within Range:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $11,000, he's getting a good deal, as the product is worth $10,000 to him.
* **Collaborative Tone:**  The message emphasizes finding a fair price for both of us, fostering a more cooperative negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I've successfully negotiated a profitable sale.
* If Bob rejects, I will assess his next offer. If it's still too low, I'll consider selling to John.
*  If the negotiation continues, I'll adjust my counteroffers based on Bob's responses, aiming to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $10,500 is only $4,500 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While not ideal, it's a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Accepting this offer could lead to future business opportunities with Bob if he's a reliable customer.
* **Time and Effort:** Further negotiation might be time-consuming and uncertain. Accepting this offer secures a sale quickly.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll complete the sale with Bob and explore potential future collaborations. 
* If future deals with Bob are unlikely, I'll prioritize selling to John for my minimum price on future products."
