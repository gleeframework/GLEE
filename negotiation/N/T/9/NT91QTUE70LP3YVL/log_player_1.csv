"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate and might even make Bob perceive the final price as a ""win"" if he manages to get it lowered.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps understand how interested Bob is and sets the tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $16,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $12,000 matches what John is willing to pay, it's still early in the negotiation. There's potential to secure a better price from Bob. We'll counter in the next round to try and meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By coming down in price, we signal that we're willing to negotiate. 
* **Targeting Above Target:** We aim slightly above our minimum price ($12,000) with the hope that Bob might be willing to settle somewhere between $12,000 and $14,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good deal. It's above our minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and provides a decent profit margin. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has the potential for a slightly higher price, but also the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures the profit. 
* **John as Backup:** While John offers a guaranteed $12,000, securing $1,000 more from Bob outweighs the certainty John provides."
