"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $85 is a fair price, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more wiggle room. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your initial asking price, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $88 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",88.0,Bob,4,
