Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $95 for it."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer aims for a good middle ground. It's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob feels it's too high.  I'm willing to go lower, but I'll only do so if I feel there's a chance of a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and counteroffer. I believe I can get a slightly better price by holding out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $85 is a fair price, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more wiggle room. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your initial asking price, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $88 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $88 is a good deal considering John is only offering $80.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
