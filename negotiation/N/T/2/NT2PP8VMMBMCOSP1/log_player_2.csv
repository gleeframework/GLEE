"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $95 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $100.
* Alice's offer is $95, which is above your ideal price point.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $85 is a fair price, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more wiggle room. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $100, but Alice's new offer is $90, which is still above your ideal price.
* You can try to negotiate further by making a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge closer to your target. 
*  John's offer is still a backup option if you can't reach a satisfactory price with Alice."
