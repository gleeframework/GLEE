While $110 is better than nothing, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."

Bob's offer of $105 is too low, and I've already had three rounds of negotiation.  It's time to move on to a guaranteed sale with John."
