"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, $8,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my original offer of $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still committed to your original offer, Bob. However, I need to prioritize my own interests and make a profit. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $10,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll derive from the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute maximum. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach a deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $9,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll derive from the product, and it's a significant increase from your last offer.",11000.0,Alice,7,
