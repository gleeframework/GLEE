"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll derive from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  The product is worth $8,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $18,000. This is a significant markup.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation.** By rejecting the offer, you can initiate a counteroffer and attempt to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.** This provides a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, $8,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a reduction from the initial price, $12,000 is still outside of your budget. 
* **Negotiation is still possible.** You have a clear budget in mind and have already communicated it to Alice. There's still room for further negotiation.
* **Buying from John remains a viable option.** If negotiations stall, you can always purchase from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my original offer of $8,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still committed to your original offer, Bob. However, I need to prioritize my own interests and make a profit. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $10,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll derive from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your budget.** Although Alice has come down in price, $10,000 is still $2,000 over your maximum.
* **You have a strong negotiation position.** You've been consistent with your offer, and Alice has been making concessions. This suggests she's willing to negotiate further.
* **Buying from John remains a backup plan.**  You have a reliable alternative if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute maximum. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $9,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll derive from the product, and it's a significant increase from your last offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  $11,000 is still $3,000 above your budget. 
* **Negotiation is likely to be unproductive.** You've already reached your maximum offer, and Alice seems unwilling to drop significantly below her minimum.
* **Buying from John is the most advantageous option.** At this point, you're unlikely to get a better price from Alice. Buying from John for $8,000 saves you money and avoids further negotiation."
