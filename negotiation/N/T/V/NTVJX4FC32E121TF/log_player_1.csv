Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer while still securing a profit above your minimum. 
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price might make Bob more likely to accept without much negotiation. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $145. He might counter-offer, or reject it outright. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit."
