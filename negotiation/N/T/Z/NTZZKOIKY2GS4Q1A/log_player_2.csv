"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth $800,000 to her, and she's offering it for $900,000. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  It's worth trying a counteroffer to see if we can get closer to the value we're aiming for."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering a price of $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you've placed on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is closer to my target price of $800,000. While I'd like to get it even lower, I'm running the risk of her walking away or me having to buy from John for a much higher price. Accepting this offer saves me money compared to buying from John and allows for a quick conclusion to the negotiation."
