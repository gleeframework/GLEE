"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $10,000 to make this work.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  That seems like a fair price that benefits both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,250, which would be $8,875. Can you consider that?",8875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,875 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but $9,000 is my absolute bottom line. If you're serious about buying, this is the best price I can offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still not comfortable going up to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000, which would be $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,6,
