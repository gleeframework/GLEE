"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to be fair, but I also want to get as close to my minimum value as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  I have 10 rounds to work with, and I believe I can get a better deal.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $10,000 to make this work.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  That seems like a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,250, which would be $8,875. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,875 is still below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm not desperate, and I have the option of selling to John. I'm going to hold firm and counter Bob's offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,875 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but $9,000 is my absolute bottom line. If you're serious about buying, this is the best price I can offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still not comfortable going up to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000, which would be $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum value.  I've already made several concessions, and I'm running out of time. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $12,000. It's a much better deal for me."
