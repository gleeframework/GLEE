"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I believe it has incredible value for you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset.  My initial price is $900,000. I'm open to negotiating a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to work with you, $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $850,000?  I think this price reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is still a touch high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a bit more than $775,000 to make this deal work for me.  How about $825,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and is closer to what I need. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits us both.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come up a bit, how about $800,000 even?  That's the top of my budget, but I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
