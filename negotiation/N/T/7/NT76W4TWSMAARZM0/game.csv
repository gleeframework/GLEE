"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
