"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which still gives you a significant profit margin. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this price, I'll have to look at other options.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900000 is still a bit more than I can justify. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $875000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us and avoids us having to go to John. Let's finalize this deal and avoid any further delays.",875000.0,Bob,4,
