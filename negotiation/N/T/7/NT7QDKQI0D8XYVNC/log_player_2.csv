"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob can likely get a better deal than $950,000. It's worth negotiating further with Alice to try and lower the price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which still gives you a significant profit margin. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this price, I'll have to look at other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's desired price point, it's still higher than his ideal. It's worth one more round of negotiation to try and get the price down further. There's still a potential for a win-win situation, as Alice is likely willing to accept a price closer to $850,000 than to risk losing the deal entirely and having to find another buyer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I can justify. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $875,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us and avoids us having to go to John. Let's finalize this deal and avoid any further delays."", ""product_price"": 875000}
