{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, as you know the value is significant. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves me with a significant profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not aiming for the full $1 million right away, as it leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer and allows for a more collaborative negotiation.
* **Setting a clear expectation:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the potential for a win-win situation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob accepts:** Great! I've successfully sold the product for a good price.
* **Bob rejects:** I'll need to consider his counteroffer, taking into account my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **If Bob's counteroffer is too low:** I'll likely make a counteroffer, slowly moving towards the middle ground.
* **If negotiations stall:** I'll be ready to sell to John for $800,000 to ensure I don't lose out on the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my target:** While $850,000 is still a good profit, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves less room for further negotiation.
* **Potential for better deal:** Bob is clearly interested, and I believe I can get closer to my target price.
* **Minimizing risk:** Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob without immediately falling back to the $800,000 offer from John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely in the range of $900,000 to $925,000, trying to meet him halfway.
* **Continue negotiating:** I'll be prepared to adjust my counteroffer based on Bob's response and continue negotiating until we reach an agreement or I'm no longer confident of achieving a better price.
* **Selling to John:** If negotiations stall, I'll still have the option to sell to John for $800,000, ensuring I don't lose out on the deal entirely."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000 to show my commitment to this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility while still retaining a significant profit.
* **Maintaining a strong position:** $925,000 is still considerably higher than Bob's initial offer, suggesting I'm confident in the product's value.
* **Encouraging further negotiation:** I'm highlighting the possibility of a mutually beneficial solution, emphasizing the win-win potential.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob accepts:** Great! We've reached an agreement that benefits both parties.
* **Bob rejects:** I'll need to consider his next offer carefully, deciding whether to continue negotiating or move on to John.
* **Selling to John:** If negotiations stall or reach an impasse, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $800,000, ensuring I still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $925,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $875,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it's still not a price that I'm entirely happy with.

* **Minimizing risk:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation with Bob without being forced into selling to John at a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely in the range of $900,000 to $910,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Continued negotiation:** I'll be prepared to adjust my counteroffer based on Bob's response and continue negotiating until we reach an agreement or I'm no longer confident of achieving a better price.
* **Selling to John:** If negotiations stall or reach an impasse, I'll still have the option to sell to John for $800,000, ensuring I don't lose out on the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of our last two offers, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to compromise.
* **Highlighting the win-win:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair"" and ""happy"" aspects of this offer to make it more appealing and less likely to be rejected outright.
* **Last chance to negotiate:** This offer is a clear signal that I'm nearing my limit for negotiation and am less likely to offer a lower price in the future. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob accepts:** Fantastic! We've reached a good price that benefits both of us.
* **Bob rejects:**  I'll have to seriously consider his final offer and decide whether to accept it or finally sell the product to John for $800,000. 
* **Selling to John:**  If negotiations fail, I will ensure I get at least my minimum price by selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $880,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the minimum:** Bob's offer of $880,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation fatigue:** This is our fifth round of negotiation, and it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach a higher price. 
* **No guarantee of a better deal:** There's no guarantee that Bob will accept another counteroffer, and the risk of getting stuck with John's $800,000 offer is increasing.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accepting the offer:** This ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing out completely.
* **Focus on future deals:** I will learn from this experience and be more strategic in my negotiations in the future, aiming to achieve a more favorable outcome."
