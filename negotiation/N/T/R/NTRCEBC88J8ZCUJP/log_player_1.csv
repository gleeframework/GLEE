"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win for both of us, hoping to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Room for movement:** The price is high enough to leave space for me to lower it if needed, but not so high that Bob will immediately reject the offer. 

**Next steps:**

If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'll always keep in mind the $12,000 offer from John as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's closer to my desired price, $9,000 is still below my minimum of $12,000.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I can still potentially get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer because I have John's offer as a backup. 

**Next steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired price. I will keep John's offer in mind, ensuring I don't go too low."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Maintaining my minimum:** $9,500 is still above my minimum of $12,000, so I'm not losing out on potential profit.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation friendly and encourage Bob to accept.

**Next steps:**

If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll reassess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer. I'll always be mindful of John's offer and my minimum price to ensure I get the best possible deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $9,200 is still below my minimum of $12,000. While it's tempting to accept, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I have several rounds left to continue negotiating with Bob. I'm not yet at the point where John's offer is more appealing.
* **Potential to close the deal:** I believe a little more pressure and a few more rounds might convince Bob to come up to a price closer to my minimum.

**Next steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I will continue to use a positive and persuasive tone, reminding him of the value of the product and the opportunity for a mutually beneficial deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** I'm offering a small increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still aiming for my minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, subtly implying that my price is justified. 
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I'm using positive language to foster a cooperative atmosphere.

**Next steps:**

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's getting closer, $9,150 is still below my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Limited rounds left:**  We're approaching the middle of the negotiation process, and I need to be careful not to settle for a price that's too low.
* **John's offer is becoming more attractive:**  With only four rounds left, John's offer is becoming increasingly tempting as a backup option.

**Next steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired price while still being within his budget. I will continue to use a positive and persuasive tone, highlighting the product's value and the benefits of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. If Bob rejects my offer, I will seriously consider accepting John's offer in the next round."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value and time:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value and the fact that time is running out. This could nudge him to accept a higher price.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I'm using positive language and emphasizing the benefits of reaching an agreement.

**Next steps:**

If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I will seriously consider accepting John's offer in the next round. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I still want to get the best deal possible."

**Next steps:**
