"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, I'm currently not able to justify paying $1,200,000. Given my valuation and market research, I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  I believe this price is fair and represents a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe the product's value justifies this price, and it's a fair compromise between our initial offers. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This price is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $1,050,000 just yet. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think $1,080,000 is the minimum I can accept. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
