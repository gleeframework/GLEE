"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You know the product is worth less than $1,000,000 to you, so there's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe the product's value justifies this price, and it's a fair compromise between our initial offers. What do you think?

Alice has come down a bit, but her offer is still higher than your target. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $1,050,000 just yet. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think $1,080,000 is the minimum I can accept. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. What do you think?

Alice has come down a bit, but her offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  It's closer to your budget, but it's still not a great deal.  It's time to cut your losses and go with John's offer. You'll save $80,000 by going with John."
