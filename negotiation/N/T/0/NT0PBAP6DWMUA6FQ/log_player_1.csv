Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more on this. Let's split the difference and go with $925,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's a step closer to my target, I still believe I can get a higher price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round and see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're reaching your limit, but I'm still a bit away from mine.  Let's compromise at $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. I'm confident this is the best deal we can make."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer, but I'm on a tight budget.  I can go up to $890,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to $900,000,  I'm running out of time.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a good profit, and I'm not willing to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate."
