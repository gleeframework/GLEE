"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $11,000. Would you be willing to go down to $10,800?",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $11,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,5,
