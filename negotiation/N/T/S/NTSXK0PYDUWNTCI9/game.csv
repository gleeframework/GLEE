"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little more wiggle room. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $85 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",90.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I understand your budget constraints. To be honest, $87 is really pushing my limits. However, I'm willing to make one last concession for a quick and clean deal. I'll come down to $89.  This is my final offer.  What do you say?",89.0,Alice,7,
