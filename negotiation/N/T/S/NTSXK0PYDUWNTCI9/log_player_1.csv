"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to build rapport with Bob.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value to Bob, even without explicitly mentioning his perceived value of $120. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while still securing a sale. By starting high, I increase the likelihood of getting a price closer to my ideal. However, I am also prepared to negotiate if necessary, or sell to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $80, but there's still room for me to get a better deal. 
* **Exploring Higher Price:** I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my initial offer of $100. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's a chance Bob is willing to pay more if I counter with a slightly lower price.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get the highest price possible. While $90 is a decent offer, I'm not desperate and I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little more wiggle room. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, even at $95.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price while maximizing my profits.  By offering $95, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate but also my desire to get as close to my initial offer as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80, I'm still not ready to settle just yet.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There's still room for negotiation, as Bob has shown a willingness to compromise. 
* **Time on My Side:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I can afford to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to $90 as possible.  I believe there's a good chance that Bob will eventually accept a price closer to that.  However, I'm also prepared to accept the $80 offer from John if Bob proves to be unwilling to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $85 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's the exact midpoint between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $85. This demonstrates a genuine effort to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Finality Emphasis:** I'm stating that $90 is a fair price for both of us, subtly suggesting that this is a good point to close the deal.
* **Positive and Direct:** I'm keeping the message positive and direct to encourage a swift decision.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping to close the deal at $90, which is still a good profit margin for me. By offering a compromise and emphasizing a fair price, I'm aiming to convince Bob that it's in his best interest to accept this final offer. If he rejects, I'll reassess my options, considering the remaining rounds and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $87 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $80, I'm still not ready to settle just yet.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to be more strategic.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I've come down significantly from my initial asking price, but Bob has shown a willingness to compromise. There's still a chance he might be willing to go higher.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to hold out for one more round to see if Bob will raise his offer. If he doesn't, I'll likely accept his offer, as I don't want to risk losing the sale and ending up with the lower price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I understand your budget constraints. To be honest, $87 is really pushing my limits. However, I'm willing to make one last concession for a quick and clean deal. I'll come down to $89.  This is my final offer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 89}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm stating explicitly that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to make a decision.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm offering a very slight concession from my previous offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price close to my desired outcome.
* **Emphasis on Clean Deal:** I'm highlighting the benefit of a quick and clean deal for both of us, potentially appealing to Bob's desire for a smooth transaction.

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds remaining, I'm hoping to close the deal at $89. This offer is still a good profit margin for me, and I believe it's reasonable enough that Bob might accept. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John at $80, as I don't want to risk losing out entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $89 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $88 is only $8 away from my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds remaining, I need to be realistic about my chances of getting a better offer.
* **Risk of Losing Sale:** If I reject Bob's offer and he doesn't come back with a higher counteroffer, I risk losing the sale and having to sell to John at a lower price.

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer to get closer to $90, accepting Bob's offer at $88 is the most practical decision at this point. It secures a sale and ensures that I don't lose out on any profit."
