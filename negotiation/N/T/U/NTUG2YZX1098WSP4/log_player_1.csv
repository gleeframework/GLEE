Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I'm in a strong position to negotiate with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000) allows me to gauge Bob's eagerness and potentially secure a much higher profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can always negotiate downwards, knowing my minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000."
