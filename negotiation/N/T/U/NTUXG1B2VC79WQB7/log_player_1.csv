{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really like the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $140? That's the highest I'm able to go right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is higher than my minimum, it's not ideal. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $140 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $155? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a little above my limit. How about we split the difference and go for $152.50? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $152.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $152.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $152.50 is a bit lower than my initial goal, it's still above my minimum and a decent compromise.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm happy to close the deal."
