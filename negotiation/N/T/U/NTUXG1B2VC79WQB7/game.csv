"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really like the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $140? That's the highest I'm able to go right now.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $140 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $155? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a little above my limit. How about we split the difference and go for $152.50? I think that's a fair compromise.",152.5,Bob,4,
