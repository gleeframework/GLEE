Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point.** It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and emphasizes value.** It suggests the product is good for Bob, increasing his potential desire to purchase.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize profit:** This approach aims to get as close as possible to my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation room:** It leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth that could potentially lead to a higher price.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob. If Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable, I can confidently walk away and secure the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than my initial offer. Accepting it would result in a considerable loss. Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain control and potentially negotiate a higher price.  While I can sell to John for $15,000, I'm still hopeful to secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to sell the product without losing too much."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  Instead of rejecting Bob outright, I'm offering a counter-offer that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a reasonable price for me. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm emphasizing that $10,500 is a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and potential willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While $10,500 is lower than my desired $15,000, it's still a good profit margin. This keeps me in a strong position if Bob refuses to go higher.  If he rejects my counteroffer, I can then decide to accept John's offer or make a final counteroffer to Bob before selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500? That's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000.  At this point, I've already made two counteroffers and reached a point where further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a price I'm comfortable with. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me the best possible outcome and secures a good profit. It's time to move on to a buyer who values the product closer to its true worth."
