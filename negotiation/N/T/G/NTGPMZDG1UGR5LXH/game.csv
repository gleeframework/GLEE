"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. This is a very interesting product, but I'm not sure I can justify $1500000 at this time. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, which reflects its value to me.  Let me know if you're interested in exploring this further.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in this product and believe we can find a mutually agreeable price.  How about $1300000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to make a good sale.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1350000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is already a compromise, and I believe the product's value justifies this price. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
