Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's really valuable to me. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  $110 is still within the range of what the product is worth to me ($100 minimum). This makes the initial offer reasonable, but also indicates that I am willing to negotiate.
* **Express value:** Highlighting the value of the product to me can help Bob understand the reasoning behind the initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to earn as much money as possible. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I could get from John ($100).
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can likely negotiate a higher price with Bob.  Since he is interested, it's worth exploring a counteroffer.
* **Risk mitigation:** Selling to John ensures a guaranteed $100, but I have a chance to get more by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $95?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Offering a price in the middle between my initial offer and Bob's shows I am willing to negotiate.
* **Value justification:**  Highlighting fairness helps Bob see the value in the counteroffer.
* **Negotiation space:**  $95 leaves room for further negotiation if needed, but still represents a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $95 is a fair price for you, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:**  While $85 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than the guaranteed $100 I can get from John.
* **Limited negotiation space:**  Bob has already gone down to his minimum price.  Further negotiation is unlikely to get me a much higher offer. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and ultimately ending up with less money. 

**Conclusion:**  It's in my best interest to sell to John and secure the guaranteed profit of $100."
