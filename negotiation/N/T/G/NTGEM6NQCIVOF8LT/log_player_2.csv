"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, you can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is too low for me.  How about $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,000 is still lower than what John is offering ($10,000). 
* It's also a reasonable compromise after your counteroffer.
* Accepting this offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John, which is a significant amount."
