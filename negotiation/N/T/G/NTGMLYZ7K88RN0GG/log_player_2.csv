"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, you can potentially do better.  You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's product is worth $80 to her. There's room for negotiation to find a price that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price of $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $100. How about we try $95? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is a good compromise. It's still within your budget of $120 and closer to your desired price of $90.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially losing the product is high. It's better to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with."
