"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider offering the product at $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my set limit. Could we perhaps agree on $15000 for the product?",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $17000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $16500?",16500.0,Alice,5,
