"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product for $115. It's a steal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $115 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $120, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $105.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 isn't quite enough for me. How about $110? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still get great value from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $100.  Rejecting the offer again gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price.  He can try to meet Alice halfway, or even push for a lower price, since he has the option of buying from John for $100 if the deal falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $110 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $107.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm firm on $110.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now firm on $110, and Bob's goal is to stay within his $100 budget.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk is that it could drag on and Alice might eventually end the negotiation.  At this point, it's more prudent for Bob to take the guaranteed deal from John for $100 and avoid the risk of losing out entirely."
