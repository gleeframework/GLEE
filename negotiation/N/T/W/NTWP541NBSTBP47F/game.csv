"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand your offer is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher and offer $825,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,
