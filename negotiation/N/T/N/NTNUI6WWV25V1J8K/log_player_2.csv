"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $12,000 is not a good option. Buying from John for $10,000 is a viable option, but it's worth seeing if Bob can negotiate a better price with Alice first.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows Bob to try and get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
 
Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good price quickly.  By offering $9,000, he's demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still staying within his budget.  This move puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or counter with a more reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum value of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price.  It's possible that Alice might be willing to come down further, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to walk away from the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

Bob is now increasing his offer by $500. He's showing Alice that he's willing to negotiate and get closer to her desired price but still maintaining his limit of $10,000. This move could be a good compromise, and if Alice rejects it again, Bob might consider buying from John as there are limited rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still within his budget of $10,000, so it's not time to buy from John yet.  Alice's offer is getting closer, but Bob should keep trying to negotiate. It seems like Alice is getting closer to his price point.  One more round of counter-offers could be enough to secure a deal within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob is now offering his maximum price of $10,000. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product, but he is not willing to go any higher. It's a bold move that could either lead to a deal or force Alice to reject the offer. If she rejects it, Bob might have to consider buying from John to avoid running out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,125 is just slightly above Bob's maximum price point of $10,000. However, with only 3 rounds remaining, it's a good idea for Bob to accept the offer. He might not be able to get a lower price within the remaining rounds, and buying from John would cost him the same amount. It's a good deal, and accepting it secures the product for Bob while staying within his budget."
