# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate and meet in the middle.  While we might be able to get the price down a bit more, $750,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer and a reasonable price overall."
