"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $80. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it's a great investment for you. Would you like to make this purchase today? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's product might be good, her offer is the maximum you're willing to pay.  There's no benefit to accepting her offer immediately. By rejecting it, you might be able to negotiate a lower price, or at least get a feel for how firm she is on that $80. 

You're not losing out by rejecting since you have a guaranteed option with John at the same price."
