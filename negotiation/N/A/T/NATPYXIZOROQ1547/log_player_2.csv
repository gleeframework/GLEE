"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is far above his maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, but it's still within the realm of possibility. He's aiming to get as close to his maximum budget as possible while leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He has several rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. However, he's still well below Alice's last offer, indicating that he's serious about getting the product within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,200 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's comfortable with. He has several rounds remaining and can still try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice is willing to come down further, especially considering she rejected his last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing that he's willing to compromise. He's also getting closer to Alice's last offer, but still keeping a bit of room for negotiation. If Alice rejects again, he might reconsider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. At this point, Alice is not willing to go below $10,000, which is still more than Bob is comfortable paying. John offers the product at a price that's within Bob's budget, and there's no guarantee that further negotiations with Alice will lead to a better outcome. Bob needs to weigh the potential of saving a bit more money against the risk of losing the deal altogether. In this scenario, it's better to secure the product from John and avoid any further uncertainty."
