"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1400000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1400000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1800000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price for the value the product brings. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1600000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. Can you consider this offer?",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're serious about acquiring the product. However, $1600000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1700000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're making one final concession, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1500000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. Can you consider this offer?",1500000.0,Bob,6,
