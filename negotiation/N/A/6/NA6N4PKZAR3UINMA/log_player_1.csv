Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:** A friendly message might make Bob more inclined to negotiate. 
* **Leaving space for counteroffers:**  The message invites Bob to make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open.

This strategy aims to find a price that's mutually agreeable, while also maximizing my profits. If Bob rejects this offer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation for the product. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you be able to accommodate that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'm open to negotiation, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.  I'll counter with a higher price, hoping to find a compromise closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $80 is simply too low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $95? That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm also not immediately going back to my initial price.  $95 represents a compromise that's closer to my desired value.
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate that this is still a good price for Bob, framing the offer positively.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to make another counteroffer, allowing for continued negotiation. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between my desire for a higher price and the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
