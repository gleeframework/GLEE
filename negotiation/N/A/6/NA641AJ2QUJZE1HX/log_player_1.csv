{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have a chance to get a better price from Bob. I'll try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about $1,550,000? That's still a great value for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price, considering its value to me is $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While $1,450,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a slightly better price. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm not ready to sell to John for $1,500,000 yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,500,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,425,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. 

While I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. It's unlikely I'll be able to reach a price I'm comfortable with, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John."
