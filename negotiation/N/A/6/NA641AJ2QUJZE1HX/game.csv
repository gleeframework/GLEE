"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about $1,550,000? That's still a great value for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price, considering its value to me is $1,000,000.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
