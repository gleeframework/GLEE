"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  Given the value I'm placing on this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This represents a significant investment on my end, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $850,000 and my valuation is substantial. I'm willing to move from my initial offer, but I need to see a significant step from your side to justify letting go of this valuable product. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a significant stretch for me. To bridge the gap, I'm offering $900,000. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I hope we can reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. Your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. However, $900,000 is still below the product's true value and what I'm willing to accept.  I can go down to $975,000, but this is my final offer.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This represents a significant investment on my end, and I believe it's a fair and final offer for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
