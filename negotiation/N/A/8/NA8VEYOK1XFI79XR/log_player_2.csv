You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $15,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is my final offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  To be fair, $11,000 is already a significant reduction.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

It's unlikely Alice will go below $9,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price."
