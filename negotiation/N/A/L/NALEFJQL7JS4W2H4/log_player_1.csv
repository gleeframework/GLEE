Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, knowing it's more than Bob values the product at, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being rigid and leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, which will give me information about his willingness to pay.
* **Safety Net:** I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate for a sale and can walk away if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There is still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired amount. 
* **Testing Bob's Interest:** By rejecting his offer, I can gauge how serious he is about buying the product and how much he's willing to compromise. 

I will proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" for both of us to further encourage acceptance.
* **Confidence in Product:** I'm reiterating my belief in the product's value to reinforce its worth. 
* **Open to Negotiation (Again):** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, but getting closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $9,200? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,200 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk is that Bob will continue to push for a lower price, and I'm not sure I want to go that low.
* **Time is Money:** Further negotiation could take more time, and I value my time.  
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John guarantees me a sale at my minimum acceptable price. 

This is a safe and efficient choice, ensuring I get the best possible outcome given the current situation."
