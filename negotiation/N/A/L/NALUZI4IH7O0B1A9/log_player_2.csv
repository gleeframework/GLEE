"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. This is a significant opportunity, as I'm confident its worth is far greater.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is the same price as John's. Since there's no benefit to buying from Alice at the same price, it's better to reject her offer. This leaves open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice, or potentially finding an even better deal elsewhere."
