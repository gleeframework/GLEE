"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to me ($150) but still lower than what it's worth to Bob ($100). This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I think $150 would be a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  While I'd prefer more, it's a good deal for me and guarantees a sale."
