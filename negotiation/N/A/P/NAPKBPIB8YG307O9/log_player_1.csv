"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):** Opening with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Offering a brief reason helps frame the price as something other than arbitrary.  
* **Gauging Bob:**  This first offer will give me valuable information about Bob's negotiating style and how badly he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate your perspective on the product's value. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Serious:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000 indicates he's a serious buyer, as it's above his own valuation.  
* **Room to Negotiate:**  There's still a significant gap between his offer and both my minimum and my initial ask. I believe I can negotiate him higher. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John in my back pocket willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects a fair price given the product's unique value."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** I've significantly reduced my price from the initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic Midpoint (but tilted in my favor):**  While presented as a ""middle ground,"" $1,750,000 is still closer to my asking price. This anchors the negotiation higher.
* **Re-emphasizing Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob about the product's benefits to justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value you see in the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. This still allows me to save some money while acquiring the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  $1,600,000 is a significant amount over Bob's own valuation and a substantial profit for me.
* **Negotiation Momentum:**  Bob has steadily increased his offer, showing he's committed to making a deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially push for more in further rounds, there's a risk Bob could walk away or that the deal could stall. Accepting now secures a great outcome."
