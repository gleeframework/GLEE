Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm hoping to get a high initial offer that will give us a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is much lower than my minimum. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $14,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000, I'm choosing to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob. This ensures I get a price I'm happy with and saves me time and energy."
