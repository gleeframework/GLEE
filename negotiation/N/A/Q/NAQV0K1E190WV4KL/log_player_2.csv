**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to reach a point where it makes sense for you to buy from her instead of John. You've been consistently increasing your offers, and Alice has been consistently rejecting them. At this point, you're risking a stalemate where you end up paying more than you need to.  John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000, which is significantly better than Alice's current offer and any likely future offer."
