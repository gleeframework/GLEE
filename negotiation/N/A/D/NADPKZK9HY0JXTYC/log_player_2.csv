"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal on a high-quality product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's starting price is too high. There's room for negotiation to get closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,500) than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message remains positive and expresses continued interest in the product. This helps maintain a good negotiating relationship with Alice.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  While $6,500 is a significant drop, it's still well below my $8,000 maximum, giving me flexibility to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great compromise that still gives me a good profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:** While $8,500 is closer to my budget, it's still above what John is offering. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice seems willing to move on price, so there's likely room to negotiate further and get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is getting closer, but to be honest, my absolute limit is $7,000. If you're able to make that work, I'm ready to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm now setting a firm boundary at $7,000.  This is a clear signal to Alice that I'm serious about my budget.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating I'm ""ready to close the deal"" if she accepts, I'm adding a bit of pressure for her to agree.
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering (Slightly):**  While $7,000 is my target, I'm still open to accepting a price slightly above that if Alice pushes back strongly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,000 is your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $7,200. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $7,200 is a good price, saving me $800 compared to John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I might be able to get the price down a little more, the potential savings are small, and I risk Alice pulling out of the deal entirely. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort. Accepting now secures the deal and lets me move on."
