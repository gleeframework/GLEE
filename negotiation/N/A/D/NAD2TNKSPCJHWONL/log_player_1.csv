Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above our minimum ($150). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a significant profit if he accepts outright.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, so there's no risk of ending up with nothing."
