Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to part with the product for $1,000,000 (your deal with John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 could theoretically work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to scare Bob away with a price so high that he rejects it.  Aiming slightly below his maximum valuation gives you room to negotiate if needed.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. I know how valuable it would be for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and highlights the value for Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little while still giving you a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Confidence:** Expressing confidence in reaching an agreement can encourage Bob to engage. 

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** How Bob responds will determine your next move. If he counter-offers, you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or if you'd rather sell to John. 
* **Negotiation is Fluid:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this initial offer. Be prepared to adapt your strategy based on his response."
