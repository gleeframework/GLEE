"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $10000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I've had to pay for it. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you have a price in mind, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8500.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. I appreciate that. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $9000. How about we meet in the middle at $9250? It's a price that I'm comfortable with, and it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",9250.0,Alice,5,
