"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is your maximum, there's no reason to jump at the first offer. We don't know what Alice's bottom line is, so there's potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer (a 33% reduction) shows Alice we're serious about negotiating. It's a bold move, but it gives us room to maneuver in the subsequent rounds.  We'll see how Alice responds and adjust accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to our initial counteroffer, but there's still room for improvement.  We're not at our max yet, and there's a chance she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're steadily increasing our offer, showing Alice we're willing to meet her halfway. This counteroffer is a good compromise between our initial offer and her last one.  It leaves room for further negotiation but also shows we're serious about getting a deal done."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down again, but it's still not low enough.  We are close to our maximum but can still try to get a better price.  We've shown we're serious about negotiating, and we're confident we can get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing our maximum, but we're still pushing for a better deal.  This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offer and Alice's latest offer, showing our willingness to compromise. It's a strong but reasonable offer, and we'll see if Alice accepts it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now very close to our maximum, and Alice has come down significantly. While we could counteroffer again, it's unlikely she'll go lower, and we risk losing the deal. Accepting this offer saves us $2,200 compared to buying from John, and it's within our budget. It's a good compromise and a successful negotiation."
