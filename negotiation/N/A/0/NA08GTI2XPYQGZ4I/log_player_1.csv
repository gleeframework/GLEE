"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find very useful. I'm asking for $100 for it."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the message positively, highlighting the potential value to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  By starting at $100, I'm giving Bob room to counteroffer without making it seem like I'm being unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to pay less than $100. Could we agree on $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$85 is too low:** While $85 is above my minimum of $80, it's still below the value I'd like to get for the product. 
* **More negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob. I'm not willing to settle for $85 just yet. 
* **Assessing John's offer:**  While John is a backup option,  I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $85 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? This would still be a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Reinforce value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a great deal for him, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Build rapport:** I'm trying to maintain a positive and collaborative tone, making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I still feel that $92.5 is a bit high. Would you consider $87.5? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $87.5 is closer to my minimum, I believe there is still room to negotiate. I don't want to settle for this price if I can get more.
* **John is a backup:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay $80, but I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm maintaining some leverage and showing that I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  Let's meet in the middle again. Would you be willing to go up to $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise again:** I'm offering another compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, creating a sense of mutual benefit.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm stressing the importance of closing the deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
