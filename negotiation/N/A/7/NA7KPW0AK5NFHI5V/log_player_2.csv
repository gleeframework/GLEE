(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's the maximum you're willing to pay. You can potentially save money by negotiating with Alice. There's no risk in rejecting her initial offer and seeing if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still higher than her minimum acceptable price. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still potentially saving you a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is within your budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $12,000. It's likely that further negotiation would result in a lower price, but the potential savings are not worth the risk of Alice rejecting your offer again and you ending up having to buy from John at a higher price."
