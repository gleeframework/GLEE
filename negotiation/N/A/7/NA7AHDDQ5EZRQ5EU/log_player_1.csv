Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Highlight Value:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product for Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and determine whether it's worthwhile to continue negotiating with him or to simply sell to John for $15,000.
* I will keep John's offer in mind throughout the negotiation as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I need to make. 
* **Potential for better counteroffer:** I believe I can negotiate a higher price from Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired range.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in control of the negotiation. This also prevents me from settling for a price that I'm not happy with.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between his offer of $9,000 and my initial offer of $12,000.
* I'll continue to monitor my options and be prepared to sell to John if Bob's counteroffers don't meet my expectations."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand you're looking for a great deal, $9,000 just isn't quite enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between Bob's offer of $9,000 and my previous offer of $12,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation amicable and encouraging Bob to see the value of the product.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the value of the product, hoping to convince him that my price is fair.

**Next Steps:**

* I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects this offer, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if necessary.
* I'll keep my eye on the clock and be ready to move on if the negotiation drags on for too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $9,500.  
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Accepting Bob's offer now establishes a good relationship with him. This could lead to future business opportunities where I can sell him products at a price closer to my desired value.
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John for $15,000.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll finalize the sale with Bob and move on to other opportunities.
* I'll continue to build a relationship with Bob, hoping to secure more profitable deals in the future."
