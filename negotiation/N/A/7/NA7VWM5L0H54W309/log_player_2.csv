Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice.  $14,000 is too close to your maximum, and there are still rounds left."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit further.  $13,000 is a good price, but I can still try to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,000. How about we split the difference at $12,500? I think this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
