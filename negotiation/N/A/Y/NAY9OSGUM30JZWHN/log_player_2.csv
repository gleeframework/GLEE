Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $11500. This is the last time I'll come down, so if you're serious about buying, this is your chance.

Bob should buy the product from John for $10,000.  Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget and he only has a few rounds left.  It's better to secure the product for a lower price from John than to risk losing out on a good deal."
