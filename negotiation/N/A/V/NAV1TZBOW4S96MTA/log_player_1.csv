Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't have to settle for less than $800,000, making this a strong starting point.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or willingness to pay. Gathering more information about Bob could lead to a more tailored and potentially more profitable offer."
