"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $2,000,000. I think its value will become clear during our discussions."",
 ""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** While the price is high, I offer a soft justification (""unique opportunity"") to avoid immediately alienating Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message implies a willingness to discuss the price further, setting the stage for a potential counteroffer. 
* **John as Leverage:**  The presence of John, my guaranteed buyer, gives me a strong fallback position. I don't mention John explicitly, as that might make me appear less flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000. This is my maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, which was expected. While I could take the sure $1,200,000, I still have ample time to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000. Selling to John right now would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, however, my valuation for this product is significantly higher. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000."",
 ""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I begin by showing Bob I heard his concerns and understand his position. This helps maintain a positive negotiation climate.
* **Firm but Fair:** While I make a significant price reduction, I'm still aiming high. This signals that I'm serious about my valuation but willing to negotiate.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** My message frames the negotiation as a collaborative effort to find a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Time Strategy:** With plenty of rounds remaining, I can afford to make gradual concessions.  I want to see if Bob is willing to move significantly from his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but $1,800,000 is still outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and shows my commitment to finding a deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is only $100,000 less than my guaranteed sale price with John.  
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has significantly increased his offer from $1,200,000, indicating genuine interest and willingness to compromise. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate for a higher price with Bob carries the risk of him walking away. Accepting his current offer secures a very good profit. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows me to access and utilize the funds sooner, which could have its own advantages."
