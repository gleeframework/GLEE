Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $12,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can start with a significantly higher offer. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value (""given its value"") to justify the high price without explicitly revealing our minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not overly aggressive, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 

By starting high and gauging Bob's reaction, we maximize our chances of securing a price significantly higher than our minimum acceptable amount."
