"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product, considering its value to me. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price closer to my maximum budget, but still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $17,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. I'm going to reject and try to negotiate further. I'm hopeful I can get the price down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate you coming down to $17,000, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product and am willing to offer $12,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to get a reasonable price.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:** 

I'm sticking to my strategy of gradually reducing the price, but still leaving room for negotiation.  $12,000 is still a decent profit for Alice, and I'm hoping she'll see the value in coming to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $12,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is getting closer to my budget, her offer is still too high. I'm willing to risk pushing further and potentially getting a better deal. I'm also starting to think about the potential for a deal with John, so I'm not entirely out of options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still above what I can reasonably afford.  I'm willing to offer $13,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a small increase from my previous offer, demonstrating that I'm still committed to finding a deal. $13,000 is still a considerable profit for Alice, and it's closer to my budget, making it a more appealing option for me. This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also highlights the need for Alice to be more flexible. I'm hoping she'll accept this offer, but I'm also keeping in mind the option to buy from John if negotiations continue to stall."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my budget, and I've already made several counteroffers.  I'm not confident that further negotiation will get us to a price I can comfortably afford. I've decided to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John for $8,000. While it's not the ideal price, it's within my budget and guarantees I get the product."
