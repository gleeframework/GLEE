"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product, considering its value to me. ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $17,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down to $17,000, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product and am willing to offer $12,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to get a reasonable price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $12,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still above what I can reasonably afford.  I'm willing to offer $13,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. ",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,7,
