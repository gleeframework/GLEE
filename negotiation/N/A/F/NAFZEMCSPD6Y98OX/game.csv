"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, I'm looking to secure a better price to make this a truly worthwhile investment.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to secure a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us. Let's close this deal and make it happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to meet your price of $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $900,000. I'm thinking of a price of $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this price. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
