"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $11,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) than Bob's estimated value ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By offering $11,000, I'm leaving a gap for Bob to make a counteroffer.  This encourages him to engage in the negotiation and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Time Constraint:** While I have 10 rounds, it's important to start strong and make progress early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,000 is too low:**  While it's better than nothing, $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay more than his initial estimate of $8,000.
* **Time Remaining:** I have 8 rounds left, so I can afford to continue negotiating and try to get closer to my desired price. 

I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My previous offer of $11,000 was rejected, so I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price to $10,000.
* **Midpoint Approach:** This offer is roughly the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It's a fair compromise that might be appealing to Bob.
* **Balancing Act:**  I want to stay as close to my desired price as possible while still keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 than his previous offer. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  I've already gone through 3 rounds of negotiation, and I'm aware that time is a factor.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower price or a stalemate.  Selling for $9,500 guarantees a profit and allows me to avoid potentially losing the deal entirely.

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and close the deal at $9,500."
