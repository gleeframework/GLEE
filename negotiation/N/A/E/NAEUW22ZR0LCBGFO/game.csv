"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about $1,050,000? That's a significant discount from my initial price, and it reflects the value I know this product will bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $950,000. Given the value this product brings, I believe $975,000 is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll gain. It's a good compromise, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
