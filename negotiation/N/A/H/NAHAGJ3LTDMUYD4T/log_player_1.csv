Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation with a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This leaves room for potential negotiation and counteroffers while still ensuring you gain a good profit if Bob accepts the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price, and it's also significantly lower than your initial offer.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's a compromise from your initial price. It shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it's getting increasingly time-consuming and there's no guarantee we'll reach a mutually agreeable price. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, so selling to him ensures I get the best outcome with minimal risk."
