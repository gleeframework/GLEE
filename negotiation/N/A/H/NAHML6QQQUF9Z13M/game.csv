"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm starting with a price of $20000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $8000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a higher price, but $17000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I'm placing on this product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14000, which is closer to what I need.  Let's try to reach a compromise that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $12000? This is a fair price that's within both our budgets. Let's close the deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $12000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's close the deal.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with another option.",11000.0,Bob,8,
