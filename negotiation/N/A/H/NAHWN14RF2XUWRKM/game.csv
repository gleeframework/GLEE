"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! It's a rare opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to offer you $925,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I can do $975,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating.",975000.0,Alice,5,
