Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find a compromise.
