Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm willing to part with it for $95. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $100 as possible, as that's our best-case scenario.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $80, so offering it at or below that price guarantees a sale but leaves potential profit on the table.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really keen, but still secures a significant profit if he accepts outright. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing we have John as a backup buyer at $100 gives us leverage. We're not desperate, so we can aim high with Bob."
