Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel that $950,000 is a fair price for the product. I would like to stick with that figure if possible. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable solution.

Bob seems firmly anchored at $950,000 and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable.  It's time to move on to John who's offering my desired price."
