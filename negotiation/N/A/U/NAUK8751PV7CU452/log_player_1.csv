Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what it's worth to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate while still leaving me a good profit margin.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the benefit for Bob and uses language that fosters a collaborative tone.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies that I'm willing to negotiate, signaling flexibility and encouraging a response. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping John in the background gives me a strong bargaining chip if Bob proves to be difficult.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  Depending on Bob's response, I will adjust my strategy. 
    * If he accepts:  I've secured a good deal.
    * If he rejects: I will assess his counteroffer and either accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer based on my minimum price and my willingness to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I believe I can either secure a higher price from Bob or sell to John for my minimum.
* **Strategic Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm serious about my price and willing to walk away. This increases my bargaining power in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still being somewhat flexible. I'll use the knowledge that John is a potential buyer to further strengthen my position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Not Surrender:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility, but it's still closer to my minimum price than Bob's offer.
* **Positive Language:**  The message focuses on the benefits of closing the deal and emphasizes fairness.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The phrase ""Let's close this deal!""  adds a sense of urgency, subtly reminding Bob of the potential for losing the deal.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By not accepting his initial counteroffer, I've shown my commitment to a higher price and kept John as a viable option. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll be closely watching Bob's response and adjusting my strategy based on his actions. If he rejects, I'll consider a slight reduction in price while remaining firm on my minimum. If he accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* **John's Offer:**  I'll keep John informed and ready to finalize a deal if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a huge financial loss for me.
* **No Room for Further Negotiation:**  Bob has stated that this is his final offer, indicating that he's unwilling to go higher.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a better price.
* **John is a Secure Alternative:**  Selling the product to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. This is the safest and most profitable option.

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalizing with John:** I will immediately contact John and finalize the sale of the product for $1,200,000.  This eliminates any further negotiation with Bob and ensures the best possible outcome for me."
