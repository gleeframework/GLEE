Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase an exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900000. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $870000, but I need to make a profit. I'm confident that the product is worth more to you than that, so I'm willing to make a compromise. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $870,000 is now within your budget of $1,000,000.  While it's still higher than your ideal price, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product while still saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
