"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate further.  However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,750. Let's meet in the middle.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,750. I'm thinking of selling the product for $10,875. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it. What do you think?",10875.0,Alice,5,
