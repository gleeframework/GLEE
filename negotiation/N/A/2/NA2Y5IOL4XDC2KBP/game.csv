"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and allows for some room for negotiation.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me and our previous offers. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. I understand that's a bit above your target, but I believe the product's value to you is worth it. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering our previous offers and the product's value to you.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,175,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering our previous offers and the value of the product to me. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering our previous offers and the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
