"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is above my budget. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've considered your proposal, and while I recognize your valuation, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still significantly higher than what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This represents a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us to reach an agreement. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to compromise further, but $900,000 remains below its true value. Let's settle this right now.  I'm prepared to accept $1,050,000. This offer reflects my strong desire to close the deal with you today.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us to reach an agreement. If you're willing to accept this, I'm ready to close the deal today.",950000.0,Bob,6,
