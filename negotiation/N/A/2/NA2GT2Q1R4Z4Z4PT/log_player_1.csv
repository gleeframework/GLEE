"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $120 to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a good compromise, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work out a better deal. Considering the value of the product to me, I'd like to propose a price of $90. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I believe I can still get closer to my goal.  I'm going to counter with a price that's slightly lower than my initial offer, leaving room for further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 95}
