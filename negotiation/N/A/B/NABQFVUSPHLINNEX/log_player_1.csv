Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. I understand it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. My initial offer is $950,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** Starting with $950,000 allows room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Message Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, potentially making him more inclined to negotiate.
* **Option to Walk Away:** Alice has the backup option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go in her favor. This gives her leverage throughout the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $875000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $875,000 is still significantly lower than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Alice has the option to counteroffer and potentially push Bob closer to her desired price. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, Alice has the opportunity to potentially earn more by continuing negotiations with Bob.

**Next Step:** Alice should make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to her minimum acceptable price, but leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $875,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on the value of this product.  I'm prepared to accept $925,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're open to this price."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Alice has decreased her price from $950,000 to $925,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, this price is still above Bob's offer, leaving room for further discussion.
* **Message Tone:** The message is firm but polite, emphasizing the value of the product and the concessions Alice is making.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Alice maintains her minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 while giving Bob a small window for negotiation. This keeps her in a strong position and prevents her from accepting a price significantly lower than her value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I believe we can find a solution that works for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $900000 for the product. This proposal represents a reasonable compromise between our positions and allows me to stay within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While Alice could potentially push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and a significant profit. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is still an option, it's a smaller profit than what Bob is offering. 

**Conclusion:**  Alice should accept Bob's offer. The risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential for a smaller profit."
