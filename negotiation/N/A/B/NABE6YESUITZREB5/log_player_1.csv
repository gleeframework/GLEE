Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting high to establish a strong position and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Below Bob's value:** The offer is still significantly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000), making it attractive.
* **Above my minimum:** The price is comfortably above my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), ensuring a good profit.

This strategy aims to secure a deal quickly at a favorable price while leaving room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is tempting, it's still a significant amount below his perceived value of the product. I believe there's room for further negotiation to bridge the gap and reach a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to counter-offer in hopes of securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,250,000 is a strong offer, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly and propose a price of $1,300,000."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, indicating willingness to negotiate.
* **Small adjustment:** The decrease is modest, maintaining a firm stance on the product's value.
* **Above Bob's offer:**  The counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while aiming for a higher selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,225,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently meeting me halfway, indicating a genuine interest in the product. While I'd ideally like a price closer to $1,300,000, accepting his offer of $1,225,000 secures a substantial profit of $225,000. Further negotiation risks pushing Bob away, and the difference in potential profit doesn't outweigh the risk of losing him as a buyer altogether."
