"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000.  It's a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  $20000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, Thanks for your offer. I understand it's lower than I'd hoped. While I'm eager to find a buyer, I need to make sure the deal works for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12000. This price is a significant step towards your offer, and I'm hoping we can find a solution that benefits us both.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still outside my range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8000.  If this doesn't work for you, I'm going to have to consider other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still not able to go that low.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $10000. This is a substantial reduction from my previous offer, and I hope it's a good starting point for us to find an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $8000.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
