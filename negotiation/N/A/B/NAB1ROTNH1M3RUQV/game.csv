"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $13,500. I think that's a fair price considering the value you've mentioned earlier.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned earlier.",14000.0,Bob,6,
