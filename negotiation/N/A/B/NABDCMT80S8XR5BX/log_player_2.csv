"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but could you do it for $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message aims to be respectful while clearly stating my price target.
* **Strategic Goal:** My ideal outcome is to get Alice closer to my $8,000 maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is significantly below my asking price, I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to facilitate the deal.  Remember, this product holds real value for you and could bring significant benefits.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, $9,000 is still $1,000 more than John's offer. I'll counteroffer in a way that encourages her to move closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That would work well for me."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer suggests a compromise while still leaving room for Alice to come down a bit further.
* **Direct and Reasonable:** The message is straightforward and presents a clear target price without being overly aggressive.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** I'm getting closer to my limit. If Alice doesn't budge significantly in the next round, I may have to consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it's very close to my minimum acceptable price.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll need to move on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. 
* **Too High:**  Even with her moving down, $10,000 is still significantly more than John's offer of $8,000. 
* **No More Room to Negotiate:** It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and it's not worth the risk of further counteroffers.

It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John at a price I'm comfortable with."
