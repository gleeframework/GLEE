"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to establish a strong starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** This price leaves room for me to lower the price in subsequent rounds if necessary. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm framing the offer in terms of the value the product holds for Bob, which could entice him to consider it. 

**Note:**  This is a strategic starting point. The actual negotiation will depend on Bob's response and my assessment of the situation. I'm always prepared to sell to John if I feel I'm not getting a good enough deal from Bob."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Room for counteroffers:**  I have multiple rounds left, and I can likely secure a better deal with some strategic negotiation. 
* **John is a backup:**  I'm comfortable holding out and using John as a safety net if negotiations with Bob break down.

**Next Step:**  I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a great deal. Let's see if we can close this now."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial offer.
* **Still within my desired range:**  $1,100,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Urgency:**  I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency by suggesting that we close the deal now, hoping to entice Bob into accepting. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy for the remaining rounds accordingly."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** With several rounds left, I can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range.
* **John is still a backup:** I'm comfortable holding out and using John as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Step:** I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range while leaving room for further compromise if needed."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and puts us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  I'm lowering the price significantly again to show my willingness to reach an agreement.  
* **Still above my minimum:** $1,050,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I'm not making a loss.
* **Creating urgency:** I'm emphasizing the need to reach an agreement to encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's response.  If he rejects this offer, I might consider going lower, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as my backup."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited rounds left:** With only 4 rounds left, the pressure is mounting to secure a good deal, but I don't want to rush into a decision that undervalues my product.
* **John is a secure backup:**  I know I can sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.

**Next Step:**  I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap but staying firm on my minimum price."

```

* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the limited rounds left to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:**  I'm framing this offer as a significant compromise, implying that I'm pushing my limits to reach a deal.

**Next Steps:** 

* I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. 
* If he rejects this offer, I'll have to weigh the remaining rounds against John's offer. 
* If there are only a few rounds left, I might consider lowering my price further, but I won't go below $1,000,000."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Minimum:** While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, it's still below it. 
* **Limited Rounds Left:**  Only 2 rounds remain.  The likelihood of getting a higher offer from Bob is low.
* **Secure Backup:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum and a safe choice. 

**Conclusion:**  At this point, the risk of not securing a deal with Bob outweighs the potential benefit of getting a slightly higher price.  Selling to John ensures I meet my minimum price and avoids the risk of a deal falling through."
