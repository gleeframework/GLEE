I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $15,000 is my minimum, I can still try to negotiate a better price."

``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not the ideal price, it's still above my minimum and closer to my initial asking price.  It's better to secure a sale now than to risk losing him and having to sell to John for less."
