"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,400,000 is significantly lower than the product's value.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,550,000?  This would still give you a good deal while ensuring I receive a fair price.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
