Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed $100 offer from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $99 is close to your minimum, it leaves a slight chance Bob might negotiate up a little. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** $99 feels significantly cheaper than $100, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have no way of knowing how much Bob is *willing* to pay, only the product's value *to him*."
