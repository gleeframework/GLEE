Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a good profit margin. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
