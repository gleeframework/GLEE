"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $800,000 to you. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my target price as possible.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a good profit margin. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit margin. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me and allows you to make a good profit. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go down to $900,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in this compromise.",925000.0,Alice,5,
