Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $8,000, and I know you'd benefit greatly from it. To make this a swift decision, I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,750.  Let me know your thoughts!"", 
""product_price"": 8750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is above Bob's perceived value, it leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the value of the product, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider, given the product's value to him."
