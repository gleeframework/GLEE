"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. You know the product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to you, and you can get it for that price from John. By rejecting, you can try to get a lower price from Alice. You have 10 rounds, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it shows that I'm serious about negotiating.  It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it will give us a starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but it's still too high. I can still potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer gives me another chance to try and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial counteroffer. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to come down further."
