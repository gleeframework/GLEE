Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a valuable product.  I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Targeting the ""sweet spot"":**  You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000. Aiming for a price between these figures maximizes your potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Creating urgency:** The phrase ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly before he misses out on what he might perceive as a good deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, the message doesn't completely close the door to negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide if you want to accept, counter again, or move on to John."
