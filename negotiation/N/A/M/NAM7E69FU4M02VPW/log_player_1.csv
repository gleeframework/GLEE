Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it presents significant value at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering the product at $10,000, we can gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, we've maximized our profit. If he negotiates, it shows he's interested but wants a better deal.
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John. This knowledge gives us leverage in our negotiation with Bob."
