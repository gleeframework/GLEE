Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is way out of my price range. I'm only willing to pay $80 for this product. Let me know if you're interested.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still too high for me. I'm really only able to pay $90 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

We're getting closer, but we're still not at a price I can accept.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a little too much for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $90. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

It seems unlikely Bob will go above $90. It's time to cut my losses and secure a sure sale with John at my minimum acceptable price."
