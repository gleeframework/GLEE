{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $10,000 allows you to potentially capture a significant portion of the value difference ($12,000 - $8,000 = $4,000) while still exceeding your minimum selling price. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between:

* **Securing the Sale:** A price closer to Bob's valuation increases the likelihood of him accepting. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** A price closer to your minimum might be rejected, leaving you with the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
