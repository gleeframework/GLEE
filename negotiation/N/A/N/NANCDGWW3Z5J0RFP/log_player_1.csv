Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to me.  This gives me room to negotiate and also signals to Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that's significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,300,000. This is still a good price for me, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise and hopefully will lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. It's better to accept this offer than to risk another round of negotiation and potentially lose the sale to him entirely."
