"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $7,500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 might be a bit steep for your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $7,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,000 is still a bit out of reach for me at the moment. Could you do $6,500? That would work much better for me.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $7,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $6,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's the best deal you'll get. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",6750.0,Alice,5,
