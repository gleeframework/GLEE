Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $11,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves room for negotiation if he's willing to pay more. I'm also keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $12,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $10,500.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still significantly higher than what he offered.  I believe this price is fair considering my minimum value and the potential of selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still too low for me. Even though it's close to my minimum, I'm not comfortable with the risk of further negotiation. I've already gone through several rounds and haven't reached a price I'm happy with.  I'd rather secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
