"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  $1,100,000 is a good starting point, as it's significantly more than my minimum price of $800,000, but also leaves room for Bob to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.  I'm hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target of $1,100,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise, still leaving room for negotiation, but getting closer to my desired price. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this offer, considering it's still significantly more than what John is offering."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still holding out for a better price. Bob's offer is getting closer, but I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise, but still a strong price considering the value to Bob.  I believe this is a fair offer that both of us can agree on. If Bob rejects this, I'm getting closer to considering John's offer."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hopeful I can secure a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find common ground."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a significant compromise, but it's still a good price for me.  I'm getting closer to John's offer, and I believe Bob will recognize the value of this product and accept."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time. Bob's offer is just above my minimum price, but I don't think I can squeeze out a better deal in these final rounds. It's time to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
