Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high but reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 is higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than your minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if needed while still aiming for a good profit.
* **Creating a sense of value:** The phrase ""special price"" and highlighting the ""value it provides"" aims to entice Bob and make him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Direct and clear communication:**  The message is straightforward, making it clear what you're offering and prompting a response from Bob.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** You make a $25 profit, which is better than selling to John for your minimum price.
* **Bob negotiates:** This opens the door for you to potentially still sell the product above your minimum while staying below John's offer.
* **Bob rejects:** You sell to John for $150, achieving your minimum acceptable price."
