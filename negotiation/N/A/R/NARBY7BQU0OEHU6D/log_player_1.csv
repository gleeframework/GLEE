I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm close to a deal with Bob, the price hasn't reached my desired level. I've negotiated as much as I can, and John offers a much better price that meets my needs.  I'm not willing to risk losing out on a significantly higher profit just to close a deal with Bob."
