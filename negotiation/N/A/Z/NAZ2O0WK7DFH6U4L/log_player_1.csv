"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it gives me a good starting point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I have 8 rounds left to try and negotiate a better price.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a bit closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I'd prefer. I have 6 rounds left. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk a few rounds to potentially secure a better deal.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your offer. However, $8,500 is still below my minimum. Let's try one last time to find a solution. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a good compromise that allows both of us to achieve a positive outcome. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the negotiation process. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm offering $8250 for the product. This is my last offer, and I expect it to be accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,250 is still lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  He's also becoming more agitated, making the negotiation process more stressful.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time to get a price that's closer to what I want. It's time to cut my losses and move on. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me the best possible outcome."
