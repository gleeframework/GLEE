Alice's offer:

While Alice's offer is tempting, there's still room for negotiation. You're aiming for a price closer to your value of $8,000, and there's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down a bit more to secure the sale."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a great deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $9,250. This is a very competitive price, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for Bob.  He gets the product for $9,250, which is well below his maximum price of $12,000, and only $250 more than his ideal price of $9,000.  There's a good chance Alice won't come down further, so accepting her offer is the best course of action."
