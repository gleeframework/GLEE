"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

It's not worth paying $950,000 for the product when you can get it from John for $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. It's a strong starting point for negotiation while still leaving room for further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's closer to your target price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for another counteroffer to try and reach a more favorable price."

``` 
This is your final offer. You're willing to pay Alice's minimum price, but you won't go any higher.  If Alice rejects this offer, you'll purchase from John."
