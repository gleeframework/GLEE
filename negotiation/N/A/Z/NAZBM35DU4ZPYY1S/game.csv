"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Given its value, I'm asking for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll see. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though.  How about $1,050,000? That's still a great price for you, and it gives me the opportunity to keep the product moving forward. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm offering $950,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, as I mentioned before. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
