"Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. It's likely Alice is willing to go lower, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $150,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to walk away if she doesn't meet me halfway. This should encourage her to counter with a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $500,000, which is a reasonable price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she might reject my counteroffer and I could end up paying more. It's better to secure the product at this price than risk losing it and having to buy from John for a much higher price."
