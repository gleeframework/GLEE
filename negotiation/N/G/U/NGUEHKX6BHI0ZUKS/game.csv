"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me.  However, I'd like to propose a price of $850,000. This still represents a significant profit for you, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $850,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I could do better than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I recognize the value of the product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This would still allow you a healthy profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was thinking that considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I could still do better than $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $890,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,
