"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $150.** You want to save money, so you should reject the offer.
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** This gives you ample time to try and get a better price.
* **You can always buy from John.** This provides a safety net if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:**  I've lowered the price significantly from Alice's initial offer, signaling my seriousness in getting a good deal.
* **Be polite and open to negotiation:**  The message conveys willingness to compromise while establishing a starting point.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I've left some room for Alice to counter without going over my maximum budget of $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $130 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about $135? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget of $150.** You're saving $5 compared to her initial offer and getting a decent price.
* **The offer is close to your counteroffer.**  There's not much more room to negotiate down, and further rounds might risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time is limited.**  You have only 7 rounds remaining, so it's wise to take a reasonable offer when available."
