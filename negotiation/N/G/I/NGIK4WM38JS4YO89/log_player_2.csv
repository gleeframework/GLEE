"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. It's worth a significant amount to both of us, and I'm confident you'll see its worth at $1,500,000.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum valuation and significantly higher than John's offer. It makes no sense to accept Alice's offer in this scenario."
