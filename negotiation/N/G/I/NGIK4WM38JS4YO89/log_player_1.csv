Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. It's worth a significant amount to both of us, and I'm confident you'll see its worth at $1,500,000.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Target:**  I'm aiming high to maximize potential profit. While Bob values the product at $1,200,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives it as essential or if he's in a time crunch. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob pushes back on the initial price, there's room to negotiate down towards $1,200,000.
* **Strong Backup Option:** The guarantee of selling to John at $1,200,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob."
