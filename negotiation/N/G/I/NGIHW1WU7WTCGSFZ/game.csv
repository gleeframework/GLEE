"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the counter offer, Alice. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a little ways off.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is my final concession, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. I can offer it to you for $12,000, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. This is my last serious offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",12000.0,Alice,7,
