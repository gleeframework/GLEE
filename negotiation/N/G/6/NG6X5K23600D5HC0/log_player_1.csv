Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation, potentially allowing you to reach a price closer to Bob's value of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than the value I'm aiming for.  I'll reject this offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the initial $950,000, but still remaining above Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
