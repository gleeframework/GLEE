# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's still very favorable for both of us.  Please consider my offer of $950,000.  This allows you a significant gain and ensures I get a fair price.  Let me know your thoughts.
