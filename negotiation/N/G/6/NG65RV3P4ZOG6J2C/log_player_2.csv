"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  We have room to negotiate down closer to our $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with an offer significantly below Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Politeness:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important for a successful negotiation. 
* **Target in Mind:**  Our ultimate goal is to get the product as close to $10,000 as possible. This offer gives us some wiggle room to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This price is still fair considering the value to you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** Alice has come down in price, but $10,500 is still above our ideal price and our backup option with John. 
* **Strategic Advantage:**  By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about getting a price closer to our target.  Alice is more likely to make further concessions as the negotiation continues."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice.  To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and settle at $9,750?"", 
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows Alice that we are willing to move from our initial low offer and meet her closer to the middle ground. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $9,750 is still below our $10,000 maximum and gives us a small buffer if Alice tries to negotiate back up slightly. 
* **Time Constraint:** We are getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, so it's a good time to start aiming for a price that's acceptable to us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This price is still fair for both of us and represents a significant step towards a deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $10,250 is only slightly above our ideal price and our backup option. It's unlikely we'll get Alice much lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns at this point. We risk Alice becoming frustrated and sticking to a higher price, forcing us to buy from John anyway.
* **Time:**  We are over halfway through the negotiation rounds. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids the potential for things to stall."
