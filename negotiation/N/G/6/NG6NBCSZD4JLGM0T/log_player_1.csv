{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130.  It's a great deal for you, and it's worth every penny!  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts by highlighting the value proposition for Bob, and sets a price higher than my minimum threshold. This gives Bob a chance to negotiate, but still leaves room for me to earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is below my minimum, it's still close. I'm going to counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $100 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115.  It's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still above my minimum and close to my desired price. Accepting his offer is the best option in this scenario, as it ensures a sale and a profit."
