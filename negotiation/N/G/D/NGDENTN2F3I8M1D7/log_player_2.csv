# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product at a price that's significantly lower than its true value to me. I believe it will be a valuable asset for your business.  The price is $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. Buying from John gets you the product at the best possible price."
