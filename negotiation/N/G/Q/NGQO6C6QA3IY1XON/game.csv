"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the value of our product. I am unable to lower the price below $7,500. However, I am willing to include a complimentary accessory valued at $500 with the purchase.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer of the accessory, but I'm still focused on the price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $7,250?  This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and still be within my budget.",7250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thank you for your persistence. I'm glad you're considering the value of our product. I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we settle on $7,350 for the product, including the same complimentary accessory I mentioned earlier?",7350.0,Alice,5,
