{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it's also a good starting point for me to maximize my profit. I'm confident that I can get at least $12,000 from John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $11,500 is too low for me, as I'm confident I can get at least $12,000 from John. I'll counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I believe this is still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us, and it gives Bob a chance to accept a deal that's closer to his desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's only slightly below my minimum, and it's still a better offer than what John is offering. It's important to secure a sale, and I'd rather get $12,150 than risk losing out on the deal altogether."
