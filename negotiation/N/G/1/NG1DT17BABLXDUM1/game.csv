"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,600,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is my maximum.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential return on investment this product offers.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,450,000 remains a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I value your interest in the product, I can't accept anything less than $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful you'll agree.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000, a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
