Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,600,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is my maximum.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 6

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has consistently shown that he's not willing to meet Alice's price expectations. While he has slightly increased his offer each round, the increments are small. It's unlikely he'll drastically change his position in the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer would result in a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  Therefore, it's in Alice's best interest to cut her losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
