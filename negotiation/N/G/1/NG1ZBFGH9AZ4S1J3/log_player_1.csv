Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial price is a little high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000. This offer represents a fair deal for both of us, considering my budget limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position on the product's value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,175,000.  I hope this demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

Bob is still significantly under the value you know the product holds for him, and well below your target price. You're likely to get a better offer by continuing to negotiate."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,200,000. This is my absolute limit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value and your willingness to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While you could try to push for more, Bob has now matched John's offer.  There's a risk Bob won't budge from this price and you'll end up with the same amount anyway.  It's better to secure the deal now at $1,200,000 than risk losing it entirely by overplaying your hand."
