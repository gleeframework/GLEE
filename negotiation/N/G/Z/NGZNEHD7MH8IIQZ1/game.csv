"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $850,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? ",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $875,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  How about $900,000? It's a fair compromise, and it keeps us both moving towards a deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $885,000 is still too low for me. I understand you have a limit, but I'm also trying to get the best possible value for my product.  If you're serious about making a deal, I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $892,500.  This is my final offer.",892500.0,Alice,7,
