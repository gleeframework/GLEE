"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let's start our negotiation strong!",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is certainly valuable, but I'm starting with an offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation, considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for this product.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This gives you a good deal while ensuring I receive a reasonable amount for this valuable asset.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm willing to go up to $1,175,000. This is a good deal for both of us - it's closer to your asking price and still within my budget. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer, but it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to make sure I get a decent return on this product. How about $1,200,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
