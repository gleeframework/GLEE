"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $950,000 for it. This is the maximum I can afford at this time.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've given this some more thought and am willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000. This is still below your original asking price, but it's the best I can do at this time.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
