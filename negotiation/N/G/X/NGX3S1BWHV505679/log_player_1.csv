Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since the product is worth $8,000 to both Alice and Bob, starting with a higher offer ($10,000) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for Bob to counter-offer:**  Even if Bob doesn't accept the initial price, he might counter with an amount that's still higher than Alice's minimum ($8,000).
* **Having a backup plan:** Alice knows she can sell to John for $8,000 if Bob rejects the offer, so there's limited risk in aiming higher.

This strategy maximizes Alice's chances of getting the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring she doesn't lose the sale entirely."
