Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for crafting this offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell below $1,500,000 because John guarantees that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The Gap:** There's a $300,000 difference between what Bob values the product at and your minimum.

**The Strategy**

You need to offer a price that's enticing to Bob while still ensuring you get a good deal. Here's a possible approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I make it available to others.  I believe its true value far exceeds your initial assessment, but to ensure a fair deal, I'm willing to let it go for $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Why This Might Work**

* **Sense of Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is a pre-public offer creates a sense of scarcity and value.
* **High Initial Price:**  Starting with $1,450,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **""Fair Deal"" Language:**  Framing it as a ""fair deal"" despite the high price might make Bob more receptive. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher.
* **Relationship Value:** Is a strong relationship with Bob worth potentially accepting a lower price?

**Remember:** This is just one approach. The best offer depends on your specific goals and any additional information you might have about Bob."
