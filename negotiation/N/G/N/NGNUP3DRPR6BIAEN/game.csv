"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. Can you consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $15,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? I believe this is a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the value and my budget. Can you consider my offer?",11000.0,Bob,4,
