"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get a great deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Let me know if that's something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get closer to his $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget is a bit tight, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,000. It's a great compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $10,000 is still above Bob's target, but it's closer. There's still room for further negotiation, and Bob shouldn't settle unless he has to.  He should try to push Alice a little further towards his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. That's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering we're both trying to find common ground.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's still a good deal, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is still too high, but she's showing a willingness to compromise. Bob should continue to try and negotiate, hoping to get closer to his target price. He has more rounds to go, and he's not desperate yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're both trying to find a solution here.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. That's a good compromise for both of us. If we can agree on that, I can make the purchase right away. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to compromise again, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I can offer it to you for $12,500. It's still a good deal, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has gone back up in price, and it's clear that the negotiations aren't going to get Bob closer to his desired price.  He's now in a situation where he has three rounds left, and he's unlikely to get Alice down to his target.  To avoid wasting any more time, it's best for Bob to buy from John for $8,000. It's the best outcome he can achieve at this point."
