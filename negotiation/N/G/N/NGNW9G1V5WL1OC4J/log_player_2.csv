"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product that I know you'll find valuable. I think it's worth $11,500, but I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum price of $12,000 and significantly lower than buying from John.  This saves you $2,000 compared to John's offer."
