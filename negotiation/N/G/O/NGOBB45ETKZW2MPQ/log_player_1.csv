Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $110 for it.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and higher than Bob's perceived value ($80).  This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Optimistic Tone:** I'm being optimistic and positive in my message to encourage Bob to consider the deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $110 is a good starting point, I'm open to negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's acceptable or if I should make a counter-counteroffer. I'll also be mindful of the fact that I have a backup buyer in John, which gives me more bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity for better price:** I believe I can likely get a higher price from Bob by making a counteroffer. 
* **John as leverage:** Knowing John is willing to pay $100 gives me a safety net and strengthens my bargaining position.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $100.  I'll be mindful of Bob's budget concerns but will not go below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  How about we split the difference?  I can do $95 for the product.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reiterating that the product is a good value, and I'm confident he'll be happy with it.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation if Bob still feels the price is too high.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he accepts, the deal is done! If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer, or go with my backup option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $100.  There's no need to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll contact John and finalize the sale. It's a win-win situation, as I get my minimum price and John gets the product he wants."
