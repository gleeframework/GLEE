# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $680,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $710,000. This is a reasonable price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is a good deal compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and secure the product."
