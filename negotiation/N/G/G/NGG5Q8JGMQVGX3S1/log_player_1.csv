Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to maximize profit. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, she should aim higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,450,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate. Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, Alice will still make a profit over her guaranteed price. 
* **Strategic Messaging:**  The message focuses on the product's ""value and potential"" rather than just its price, appealing to Bob's potential interest. It also invites Bob's perspective, opening the door for negotiation."
