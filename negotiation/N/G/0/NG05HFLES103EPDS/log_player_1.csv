"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is a bit above what the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good deal.  I'm confident I can close the deal in the next few rounds, but if Bob doesn't come around, I can always turn to John and get my minimum asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to sell the product for $12,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,000, still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his valuation.  This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate, hopefully encouraging him to come closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a bit more.  It's still early in the negotiation and I believe there's more room for compromise. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $12,500. This is a significant concession, showing Bob that I am serious about reaching an agreement. It's also a compromise, as it's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.  I hope this will be enough to persuade Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm tempted to accept,  I've already come down significantly, and with John waiting in the wings, I believe I can push for a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12200}
```

I'm lowering my price again, this time to $12,200. This is a small concession but shows that I am willing to meet him halfway.  We are getting close to an agreement, and I want to close this deal before we run out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,100 is only $100 less than what John would pay, and we're getting very close to the end of the negotiation. It's time to accept and secure the deal. I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by being too stubborn."
