Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Anchoring:**  By suggesting $20,000, you are setting a high anchor point. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counter-offer might be closer to your desired range than if you started lower. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, who is willing to pay your minimum price. This gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

**Important Note:**  While the goal is to maximize profit, it's important to be realistic. Bob may completely reject the offer if he feels it's too far from his perceived value. You can always adjust your offer in subsequent messages based on Bob's response."
