"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth every penny of its $100 value to you. Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, I am proposing to sell it to you for $95. This is an exclusive offer tailored to appreciate your interest and ensure you get the best deal possible. Don't miss out on this opportunity to own a product that will truly make a difference in your experience. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting the offer leaves the option to buy from John, which is the best choice in this scenario as it aligns with Bob's budget."
