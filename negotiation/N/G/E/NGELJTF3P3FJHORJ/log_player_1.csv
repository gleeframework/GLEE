"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $5,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to make a deal, holding out for a much better price is worthwhile.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly below its value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $19,000 is still too far out of my price range.  Would you consider $7,000? I feel that's a fair offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, I'm a little disappointed you can't meet the $19,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're making an effort to find a middle ground, and I respect that.  While $14,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,500. Hopefully, this brings us closer to a deal we can both agree on.
