Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  The offer is still attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $15,000.
* **It sets the stage for negotiation:**  It leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, and for you to potentially negotiate a price closer to your desired outcome."
