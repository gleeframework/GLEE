"Hi Bob, thanks for considering this deal. I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe can greatly benefit you. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for both of us.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $700,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,450,000?  This reflects the value it would bring to your business.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While that's closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we try a price of $900,000? I believe that's a fair offer that considers the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's settle at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I have other interested buyers.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other buyers, but $1,200,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying.  Considering your final offer, I'd be willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. ",1000000.0,Bob,6,
