Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more in the range of $750,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $875,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to go up to $800,000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, Bob landing at my minimum acceptable price means it's time to close the deal. Holding out for a better offer from Bob carries the risk of him lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting the $800,000 ensures a sure profit."
