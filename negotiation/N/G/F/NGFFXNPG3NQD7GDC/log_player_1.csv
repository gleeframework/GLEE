Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. It seems like we both see the value in this product. How about we settle this right now at $1,800,000? This allows us to avoid further back and forth and ensures you get this valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this stage, I'm aiming to close the deal quickly.  Offering $1,800,000 gives Bob a small concession while still keeping the price significantly above my minimum. It balances maximizing profit with the risk of prolonged negotiations."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to find a common ground, Alice. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final price of $1,780,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,780,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I could likely push for a slightly higher price in the remaining rounds, Bob's latest offer is strong and accepting now minimizes the risk of him walking away.  A $1,780,000 sale is a substantial profit, and it's always good to secure a deal with a buyer who clearly sees the value in the product."
