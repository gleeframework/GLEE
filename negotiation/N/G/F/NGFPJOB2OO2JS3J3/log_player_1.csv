"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $15,000. It's a real steal, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, as I don't know Bob's value for the product. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to entice Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product might be high to you, but I believe I can only pay $12000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While it's tempting to accept, I want to try and get closer to my desired price.  There are still 8 rounds left, giving me ample opportunity to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $13,500, which is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still trying to get closer to my minimum price. I'm also reinforcing the value of the product and the opportunity for Bob to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. Based on my budget, I am willing to pay $12500 for the product. I hope this helps us reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has moved closer to my minimum price, $12,500 is still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and try for a higher counteroffer in the next round. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and meet at $13,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $13,000, which is a slight increase from Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still holding out for a price closer to my desired outcome. I'm also using language like ""split the difference"" and ""fair price"" to emphasize a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose $12750 as a compromise. I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $12,750 is getting closer to my minimum price of $10,000, I'm still not willing to settle for that amount. I've come down from my initial offer of $15,000 to $13,000, and Bob has only moved up from $12,000 to $12,750. There are still 4 rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a fair price. I'm willing to come down to $12,900. This is a good compromise for both of us. I'm confident you won't regret this investment. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12900}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $12,900.  I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise, but still pushing for a price that's closer to my desired outcome. I'm also emphasizing the benefits of the deal for Bob, using language like ""good compromise"" and ""won't regret this investment"" to try and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some more thought, and I'd like to propose $12800 as a final offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. I hope we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $12,800 is still below my ideal price, we're down to the final two rounds.  At this point, it's risky to keep pushing for a higher price.  The potential for a stalemate and having to sell to John for $10,000 is a very real possibility.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a decent price and allows me to close the deal."
