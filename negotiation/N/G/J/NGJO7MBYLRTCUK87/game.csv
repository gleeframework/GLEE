"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  This still gives me a good return, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $90 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and lets us come to an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
