{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer leaves a good margin for myself, but also gives Bob a good deal since he values the product at $15,000. This starts the negotiation at a reasonable price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is below my minimum price of $12,000. It's too low for me to accept. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This still gives you a good price, considering you value it at $15,000, and it's closer to what I need to get for it.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000. How about we try $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum price.  I'm happy to accept and sell him the product.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, it's not worth risking losing the deal entirely."
