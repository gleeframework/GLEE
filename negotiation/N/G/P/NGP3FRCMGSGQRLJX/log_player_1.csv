Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a good starting point.**  It's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate, but also leaves some room for a compromise.
* **The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.** This is important to keep the negotiation positive and open to finding a mutually agreeable price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. I'm prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response and my desire to maximize my earnings while also ensuring a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired price, it's still lower than my preferred outcome.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price, as selling to John for $15,000 is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $12,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer the product for $13,250.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise.** It's a halfway point between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying closer to my target price.
* **The message remains positive and encourages a deal.**  Highlighting the mutual benefit and emphasizing the ""split the difference"" approach can make the counteroffer more appealing to Bob.
* **I'm still open to negotiation if needed.** This counteroffer doesn't close the door on further discussion, allowing for potential adjustments based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $12,750? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. Although it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of further lowering the price isn't worth it.  John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, ensuring I maximize my earnings.  I'm confident that I can find another buyer in the future if this deal falls through."
