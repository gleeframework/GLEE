"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $14,000. I know this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice values the product at $12,000, so she might be willing to go lower. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal."
