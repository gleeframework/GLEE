"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good deal, it's still above your target of $80.  You have room to negotiate a better price, and you can always buy from John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $90, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this price is fair, considering my goal is to pay no more than $80, and I have the option of buying from John for that price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is getting closer to my target, I'm still willing to negotiate a bit further. I'm confident I can get the price down to $80, and I have the option of buying from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $80, which is my maximum price and aligns with my goal. It's a fair compromise considering Alice's previous offer of $85.  I'm confident she'll accept, as it's still a better deal than selling to John. If she rejects, I'll buy from John as a last resort."
