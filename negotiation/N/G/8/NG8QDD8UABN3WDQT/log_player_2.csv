"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still higher than what you'd like to pay. You have 9 more rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to $80, which is the product's value to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not happy with it. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I have more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $105.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still want a price closer to my ideal range.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Alice than my previous offer of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is now within my budget and is getting close to my target price.  With only 5 rounds left, it's becoming riskier to continue rejecting offers. If I don't accept, I might end up having to buy from John at a much higher price. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price now."
