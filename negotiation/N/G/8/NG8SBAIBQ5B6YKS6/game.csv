"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I think the product's value is worth more than $80. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I still think the product's value is worth more than $88. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $88. How about we try $91.50? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value.",91.5,Alice,5,
