"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but that price point is a bit high for me. Could you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is considerably below its true worth and what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
