"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm on $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both agree on. Let's work together to close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, taking anything less than $12,000 would be selling myself short.  However, I do want to make this work. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but that's my absolute lowest price. This is a great deal on a product you'll love.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to go up to $9,800. This is really stretching my budget, but I believe in the value of this product. Let's close this deal.",9800.0,Bob,8,
