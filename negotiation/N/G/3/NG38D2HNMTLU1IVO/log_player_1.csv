Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so starting near that figure is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While aiming high, leave a slight margin for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Confidence:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.

This approach balances ambition with a touch of realism, increasing the likelihood of securing a sale close to Bob's maximum valuation while still leaving you with a significant profit."
