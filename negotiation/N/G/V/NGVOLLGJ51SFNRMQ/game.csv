"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm not quite ready to pay $12,000. Would you be willing to accept $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Would you be willing to consider that price?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. Would you accept $12,500? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about my costs and my target profit. How about $13,500? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from this product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
