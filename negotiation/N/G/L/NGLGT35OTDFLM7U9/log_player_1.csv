"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with my highest possible price, as I know John is willing to pay that much. This gives Bob the maximum incentive to negotiate and allows for potential profit for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob, or fall back on John's offer if necessary.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above Bob's initial offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can find a price we both agree on. If he continues to refuse to meet my minimum price, I'll fall back on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob $1,050,000. This is a further reduction from my previous offer, but still above Bob's latest offer. I'm trying to find a price that we can both agree on. This offer is closer to Bob's perceived value for the product and I'm hopeful this will lead to a successful negotiation."
