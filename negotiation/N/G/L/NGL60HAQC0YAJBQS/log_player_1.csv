"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is significantly lower than the value I'm seeking. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,600,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. I'll pay $1350000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I still want to see if I can get a better deal. I'm not ready to settle for $1,350,000 just yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see that we're not quite aligned on the price yet. To be honest, $1,350,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. It's a fair price that considers both our perspectives.  Let's close this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1550000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to compromise further. I'll pay $1400000 for the product, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm concerned that we're not getting closer.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, it's a safer choice at this point.  I'll accept John's offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
