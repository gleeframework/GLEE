"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I understand that you're on a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1250000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1280000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1230000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1300000, but I'm not budging from there. This is my last offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
