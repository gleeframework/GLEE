Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. What do you think?,250.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a great product, but $250 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to offer you $100 for it, seeing as I can get a similar product from John for that price.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $200 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $150, as that's the highest I can go without losing too much of my own value.  Let me know if that works for you.",150.0,Bob,4,
