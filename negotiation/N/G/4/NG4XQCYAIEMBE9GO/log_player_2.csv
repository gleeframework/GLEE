"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $800,000, and Alice is asking for $900,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** It's always better to try to negotiate a better price, especially since you have a backup option with John."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000.  I'm confident this product is worth that to me, and I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I was hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a new offer of $875000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your budget.**  You're willing to pay up to $800,000, and Alice is now offering $875,000. 
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it.**  While you could try to get a lower price, you're risking Alice walking away and leaving you with only the option to buy from John at a higher price.  
* **Accepting the offer is a good compromise.** It saves you $75,000 compared to John's price and shows Alice that you're serious about the deal."
