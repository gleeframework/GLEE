"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $9,000?  This gives you a great deal and allows me to still make a decent profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That's the best I can do for now.",9500.0,Bob,4,
