Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects that. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $600,000 for it to make sense. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $600,000 is more than his initial value of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make a profit.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a low price. I have more rounds to play and can still potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $800,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
