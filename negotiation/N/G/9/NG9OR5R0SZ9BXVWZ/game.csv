"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects that. Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $600,000 for it to make sense. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $800,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,3,
