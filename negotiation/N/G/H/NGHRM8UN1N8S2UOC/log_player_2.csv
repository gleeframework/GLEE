"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product! We're excited to offer you a deal. We're willing to sell the product to you for $14000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $14,000 is over his budget, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12500. We think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
Bob should buy the product from John for $10,000. Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's budget, and there's no guarantee that they will come down further. John offers a price within Bob's budget, ensuring a successful purchase and avoiding the risk of further negotiation."
