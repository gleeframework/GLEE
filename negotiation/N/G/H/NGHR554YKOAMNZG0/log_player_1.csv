Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
