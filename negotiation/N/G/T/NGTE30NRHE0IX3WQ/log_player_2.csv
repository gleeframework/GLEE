"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob wants to save as much as possible, so he starts with a lower counteroffer than Alice's initial offer.
* **Fair offer:** $90 is a decent compromise, leaving some room for negotiation.  
* **Building rapport:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes Bob's interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great deal for you, and it's fair for me.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  $95 is still within Bob's budget of $120.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has already moved down from her initial price, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal increases with each round. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Buying from John for $120 would be more expensive, so accepting Alice's offer is the better option at this point."
