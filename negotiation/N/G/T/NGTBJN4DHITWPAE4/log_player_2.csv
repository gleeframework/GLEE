Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You're trying to save as much as possible, but Alice is already offering a price that's within your budget and closer to your ideal price of $80. Accepting her offer is the best option in this scenario."
