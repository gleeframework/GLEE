Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,080,000 is a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
