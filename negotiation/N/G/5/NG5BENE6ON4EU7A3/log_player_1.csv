Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000,  it's always best to explore maximizing profit. Bob values the product at $1,000,000, giving us some room to negotiate above that.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob. He gets it for $100,000 less than what we'd sell it to John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  We're aiming high, but depending on Bob's response, we might need to adjust our strategy in a subsequent round."
