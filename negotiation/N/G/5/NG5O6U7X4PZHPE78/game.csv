"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a significant compromise and a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a way to make this work.",12500.0,Alice,5,
