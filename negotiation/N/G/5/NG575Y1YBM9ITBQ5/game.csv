,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $13,500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $12,500. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I've made concessions, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package worth $1,000. So, the total value you'll get is $13,500. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",13000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not willing to pay $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,500, without the premium support package?",12500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you the product with extras for $13,000, and you rejected it. I'm not willing to go back to $12,500. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $13,000 and $12,500. I'll sell the product to you for $12,750. This is my final offer.",12750.0,Alice,9,
