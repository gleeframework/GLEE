Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I believe it's a great deal and would be very useful to you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $119 is just below your minimum, it leaves a slight possibility for Bob to counter-offer, potentially getting you even closer to your desired price.
* **Strategic Messaging:** Highlighting the ""great deal"" aims to persuade Bob that he's getting a bargain, even though the price is above his perceived value. 
 
This strategy aims for the best-case scenario of Bob accepting the $119 offer. If he rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your desired minimum."
