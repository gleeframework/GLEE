"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand your perspective on the value, but I'm aiming for a price that reflects the product's true worth and potential.  How about $1,100,000?  This is a price that is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal. Let's find common ground!",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. How about $950,000? This is a compromise that I think is fair and reasonable.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000 to reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference -  I'm offering $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it an excellent investment. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $975,000 is a more reasonable price. This is a fair price that I'm willing to pay for the product.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting very close. I understand you're looking for a price that works for you, but I also need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm offering $987,500. This is a compromise that demonstrates my willingness to close this deal.  Let's make this happen!",987500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about $975,000? This is a price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",975000.0,Bob,8,
