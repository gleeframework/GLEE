"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $950,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000, which aligns more closely with what I'm willing to spend.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but my initial offer reflected the true value of this product.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $800,000 is a fair price for the product based on my budget. I would like to stick to my original counteroffer of $800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,4,
