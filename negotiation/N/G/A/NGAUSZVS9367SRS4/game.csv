"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer very attractive.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product would be valuable for my business, but the price point is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product would bring to your business.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While I think it's getting closer, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $700,000. I'm offering the product to you for $800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,
