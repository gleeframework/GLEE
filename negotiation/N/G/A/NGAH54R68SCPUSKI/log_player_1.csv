"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Confidence and Value:** The message highlights the ""value and potential"" of the product, reinforcing its worth. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone is friendly and inviting, suggesting you're open to hearing Bob's perspective. 

By starting above your minimum and engaging in a positive way, you set the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value of the product, which is significantly lower than your minimum. While you could accept John's offer right now, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. It's worth exploring if you can bridge the gap and potentially get a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Would you be willing to consider $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Counter:** We acknowledge Bob's offer but stand firm that it's too low.
* **Highlight Value (Again):** Reiterate the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **Significant Drop, but Above Minimum:** We make a substantial drop from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000, showing willingness to negotiate but staying above our $1,200,000 floor.  
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The language emphasizes finding a ""fair compromise,"" encouraging Bob to reciprocate with movement on his end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is now closer to our minimum, he's moved up $100,000 while we've moved down $300,000 in our offers.  We're still significantly closer to our guaranteed sale price with John.  Rejecting and countering keeps the negotiation open while subtly highlighting that our price is firming up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,200,000.  I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions. To make this work, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000.  This is my best offer."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Urgency:** We introduce the other offer to create a sense of urgency and limited time for Bob to make a decision.
* **""Best Offer"" Language:** This signals to Bob that we're firm on this price and unlikely to go lower.
* **Slight Concession, Strong Justification:** We make a small concession from $1,300,000, but we frame it as a final move because we ""value our discussions"" and want to ""make this work."" 

This approach aims to encourage Bob to close the deal quickly at a price above your minimum while still acknowledging his interest."
