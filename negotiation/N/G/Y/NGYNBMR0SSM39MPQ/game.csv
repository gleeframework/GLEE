"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the 'introductory price,' $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",75.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I would like to propose a price of $85 for the product. This still offers a reasonable profit while being more accessible than my previous offer. Please let me know if this works for you.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $80.  That's my absolute maximum, and it aligns with what I'd pay John.  Let me know if you're willing to go for it.",80.0,Bob,4,
