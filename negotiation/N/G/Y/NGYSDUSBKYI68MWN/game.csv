"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a truly exceptional item, and I'm confident you'll be impressed by its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. This is a fair price considering its rarity and potential benefits. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's uniqueness. However, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000, as it's still below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's uniqueness and potential benefits. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and still reflects the value I see in the product. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1200000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, as it's still below the product's true value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
