"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I see the value in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to counteroffer.  I need to get closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to accept.  Let's split the difference - how about $900,000? I'm confident this product will bring you significant returns, and this price reflects that value."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I need to accept. I'll counteroffer again.  It's worth pushing for a higher price, especially since I have the option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant concession. This price reflects the value you'll gain from this product. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
