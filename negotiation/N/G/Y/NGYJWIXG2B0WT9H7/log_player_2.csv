# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I believe will be of significant benefit to you. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a price that reflects a fair compromise.  My offer is $1,200,000. This price allows you to acquire the product at a substantial discount while still enabling me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment. Please consider my offer carefully, as I believe it presents a win-win opportunity for both of us.
