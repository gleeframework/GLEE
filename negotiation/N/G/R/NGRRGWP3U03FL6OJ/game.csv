"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a lot to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $600,000 for it at this time.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting the immense value this product offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does staying within my budget. I can increase my offer slightly, but $1,900,000 is still too high. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to own this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for clarifying the situation.  While $1,300,000 is closer to where I'd need to be, it's still a significant jump. I'm willing to offer $800,000 as my final offer.  I understand this might not meet your initial expectations, but I believe it's a fair offer given my budget constraints.",800000.0,Bob,6,
