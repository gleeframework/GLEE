"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000.  This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, so this price leaves some profit margin.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested enough to make a counteroffer, giving us the opportunity to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy to sell the product for $8,000,  I'd like to see if I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it still gives me a good profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $8,500 is a good compromise.  I'm happy to sell the product to Bob at this price.  If I continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, or I might not be able to secure a better price within the remaining rounds.  It's better to accept a fair offer than to risk losing the sale altogether."
