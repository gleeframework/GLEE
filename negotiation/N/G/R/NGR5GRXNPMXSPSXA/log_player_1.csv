"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you bringing this to me.  While I see the potential,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our target price and still leaves a substantial gap between what we know he values the product at.  We'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $950,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see your point about the value of the product. However, I'm still not there yet on the price.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering $975,000.  This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product while also keeping the deal within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

We're making progress, but Bob's offer is still below our minimum acceptable price. We need to nudge him closer to the $1 million mark. We'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,025,000.  I believe this price represents a fair compromise and reflects the value you'll gain from the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting a sense we're both very motivated to make this happen.  To show that, I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This feels like a fair price point that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob has reached our acceptable minimum.  While we could push for more, accepting now ensures a great deal and avoids the risk of him decreasing his offer or us having to settle for John's offer later."
