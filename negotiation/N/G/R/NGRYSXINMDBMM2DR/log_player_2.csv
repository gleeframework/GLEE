You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's initial offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong negotiating position.  It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it gives us a good starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer keeps the pressure on her to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,100,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a good price.  This is a moderate increase that might be more appealing to Alice than the previous $1,000,000 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price and is now closer to my ideal price. Accepting her offer at $1,150,000 allows me to buy the product for a good price and save a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal or running out of rounds outweighs the potential savings."
