"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Perhaps we can settle on something closer to $800,000? How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, we're still quite a ways off from a price that reflects the value of this product. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
