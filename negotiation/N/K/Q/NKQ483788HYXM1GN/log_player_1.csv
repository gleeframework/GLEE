Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Perhaps we can settle on something closer to $800,000? How about $700,000?
