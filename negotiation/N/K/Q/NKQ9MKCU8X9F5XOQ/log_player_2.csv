"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $150.**  You're looking to save as much money as possible.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer.** This gives you more control over the negotiation and the potential for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $115 for the product? I believe this price reflects its value while staying within your financial limits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget of $150.**  You're looking to save as much money as possible, but $115 is a reasonable compromise.
* **Rejecting the offer again risks Alice raising the price further.**  You've already made a counteroffer and been rejected, so the chance of getting a lower price is decreasing.
* **Buying from John would be more expensive.**  While you could potentially negotiate with John, it's likely he'll stick to his price, making Alice's offer the better option."
