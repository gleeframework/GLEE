"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.
