"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $10,500? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",10000.0,Bob,4,
