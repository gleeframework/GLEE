{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($15,000) but leaves room for compromise. It also signals your willingness to negotiate, which might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand your valuation, but I believe I can only afford to pay $15000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation when you can secure the desired amount right now."
