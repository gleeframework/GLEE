Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's a valuable item, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate, while still leaving the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion, hoping to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $10,500? This would still be a great price for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a price that is closer to my initial offer. I am also highlighting the value of the product to emphasize the fairness of my counteroffer."
