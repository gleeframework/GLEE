"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than John's price of $12,000, you can likely negotiate a better deal. Alice values the product at $8,000, leaving room for her to go lower. Rejecting her initial offer might lead to a counter-offer closer to your desired price range."
