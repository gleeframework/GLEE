"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,500,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we meet at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
