"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. Would you be interested in buying it for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no point in paying $100 to Alice."
