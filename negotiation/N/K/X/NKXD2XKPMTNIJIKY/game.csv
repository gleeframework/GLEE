"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's a price that makes sense for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you consider $15,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  $15,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
