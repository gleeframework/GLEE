Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I believe it's a great deal and will be very useful for you."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since Bob values the product at $150 and you have a guaranteed backup buyer, you can afford to start with a price higher than his valuation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $175 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  If Bob accepts the $175, you make a $25 profit. If he rejects it, you still sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
