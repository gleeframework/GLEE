"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the price.  What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low just yet. How about $110? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great price for a product of this quality.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $108.  Let's split the difference and go with $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a deal we can both be happy with.",110.0,Alice,5,
