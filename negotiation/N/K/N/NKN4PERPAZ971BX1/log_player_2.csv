"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We are starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives us bargaining room and aims to understand Alice's lower acceptable price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85?  I'm confident this is still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we can still negotiate further. We are aiming for a price closer to $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $77? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

We are making a smaller counteroffer, moving closer to Alice's price but still leaving room for further negotiation.  The message aims to find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $77 is still a bit low for me, but I'm flexible.  I'm willing to come down to $82.  This is my final offer, and it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down significantly and stated this is her final offer. While we could push for a slightly lower price, it's unlikely we'll get much lower than $82. Accepting this offer is a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity."
