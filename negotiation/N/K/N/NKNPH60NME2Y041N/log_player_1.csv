Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $90. I think it would be a great deal for you!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $90 gives Bob a $10 discount (making it attractive) while earning you a $10 profit over your minimum.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose out on the guaranteed sale to John."
