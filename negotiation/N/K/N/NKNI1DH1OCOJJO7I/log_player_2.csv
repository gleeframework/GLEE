"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. I'm asking for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its true worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high. While the product is valuable, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. Would you consider $900,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's budget than the initial offer, it's still above his desired price point.  He can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice or by purchasing from John for $800,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open for a potentially more favorable outcome."

{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $900,000.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $875,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
