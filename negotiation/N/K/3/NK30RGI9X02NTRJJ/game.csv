"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $1,600,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offer.  How about $1,450,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still hesitant. While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a bit short of what I need.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000, which is a significant concession. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied. This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
