"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's still a good value for you, and I get a good price for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

This is a good deal for you, Bob. You save $20 compared to buying from John and get the product for less than your maximum budget."
