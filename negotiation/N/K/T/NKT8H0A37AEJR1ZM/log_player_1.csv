{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$135 is a reasonable starting point:** It's above Bob's valuation of $120, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:** It builds rapport and makes Bob feel valued. 
* **The offer is open to negotiation:**  It invites Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential win-win scenario.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer and you'll have to negotiate further. 
* **Time:**  You'll need to consider how long you're willing to spend negotiating with Bob before accepting John's offer of $150.
* **Your ultimate goal:** You want to maximize your profit, but you also need to be realistic about Bob's valuation and what's achievable."
