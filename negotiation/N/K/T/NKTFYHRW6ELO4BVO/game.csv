"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $12,500 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,250?  I'm very interested in your product, and this price seems fair to both of us.",12250.0,Bob,4,
