I'm starting with a price that's slightly above my minimum, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to pay.  I'm also trying to build a positive rapport by highlighting the value of the product.  We'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $12,500 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,250?  I'm very interested in your product, and this price seems fair to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price, and I'm confident that I can't get much better than this. I'm happy to accept his offer and sell the product for $12,250."
