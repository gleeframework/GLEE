{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $12,000 is out of my budget.  I'm interested in this product but I can only go as high as $8,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get Alice closer to your $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really keen on getting this product, but my absolute maximum is $8,500.  I'm confident we can find a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $8,500. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, $9,500 is still too high. It's worth pushing for a lower price and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is my final offer.  If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a decent profit. I'm thinking of $9,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can meet at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $9,750 is still too high for your budget. At this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed price of $8,000 from John. You've negotiated with Alice for several rounds, and it's unlikely you'll be able to get her down to your desired price.  It's time to secure the product and move on."
