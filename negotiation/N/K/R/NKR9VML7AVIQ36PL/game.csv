"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we start at $9,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While $9,500 is tempting, I know how valuable this product is and I can't let it go for less than $10,500. I think that's a fair compromise, don't you agree?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
