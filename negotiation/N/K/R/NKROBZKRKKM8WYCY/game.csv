"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's the best I can do at this time.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
