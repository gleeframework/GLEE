Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Showing Confidence:** A confident starting offer can influence Bob's perception and make him more likely to consider negotiating.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  I'm open to negotiation, and $100 gives us both room to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Protecting My Interests:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and am willing to pay $90 for it. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my target price of $100. 
* **No Guarantee of a Better Offer:** There's no guarantee that I'll get a higher offer in future rounds. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate might take longer, and I'm not sure how much time Bob will give me. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to Bob for $90 ensures a sale and a profit that's only slightly below my initial goal.  It also mitigates the risk of losing out completely if Bob decides to walk away or if I fail to secure a better counteroffer."
