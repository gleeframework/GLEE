"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that budget can be a constraint. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $13500, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",12000.0,Bob,4,
