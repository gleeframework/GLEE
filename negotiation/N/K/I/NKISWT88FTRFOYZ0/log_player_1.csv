Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, getting Bob to buy it for a price between $8,000 (his valuation) and $12,000 (our minimum) will net a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with an offer of $11,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob and positions the offer as exclusive, potentially making him more inclined to accept."
