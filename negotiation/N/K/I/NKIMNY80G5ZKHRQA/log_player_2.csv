"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice first.  If that fails, buying from John is the best option."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, I believe the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  I think this is a fair compromise, considering its potential for generating value.

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, as a price closer to $1,600,000 is still within my budget and potentially more profitable.  If I can't get her to budge, then John is the better option."

If you're not willing to accept this, then I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see that we're not too far apart on price. I'm prepared to make a final offer of $1,900,000. This represents a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to make a deal with you. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider John's offer.

Alice has come down significantly, but $1,900,000 is still too high for my budget. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise. If she rejects it, I'll buy from John."

Let me know if this is acceptable."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
