"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $980,000.  However, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to stay at least at $1,000,000.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to stay at $1,000,000, but I'm really struggling to justify that price. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's as high as I can go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",990000.0,Bob,6,
