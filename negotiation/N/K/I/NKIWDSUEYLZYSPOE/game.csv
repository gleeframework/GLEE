"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? It's a fair deal for a product we both know is valuable.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make another offer of $12,200. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to wrap this up. How about $12,350? That's my final offer.",12350.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,350 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another offer of $12,000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
