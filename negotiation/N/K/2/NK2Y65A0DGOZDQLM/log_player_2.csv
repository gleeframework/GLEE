"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is less than his maximum budget of $120, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice ($80).  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. While I'm interested, $90 is still a bit high for me.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $87? I think it's a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is now $87.** This is still below Bob's maximum budget of $120. 
* **Negotiation has already yielded a lower price:**  Bob started at $90 and brought it down to $87. 
* **Further negotiation might not yield a better price:**  Alice is already meeting Bob ""halfway.""  Continuing could risk Alice walking away or even increasing the price.

While Bob could try for $86, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal or ending up paying $120 to John.  Accepting the offer is the most rational choice."
