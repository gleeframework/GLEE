Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. I'm excited to discuss the details with you.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $1,000,000 even? That seems like a fair compromise.
