"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider an offer of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $1,000,000 even? That seems like a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll consider an offer of $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
