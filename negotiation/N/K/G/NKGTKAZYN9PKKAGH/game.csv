"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you've mentioned.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a significant gap from where I see this product's value. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,050,000? This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you've mentioned.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, I need to get at least $1,000,000 for this product to make it worthwhile for me.  How about we settle at that price? It's my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. How about we settle at $975,000 for the product?",975000.0,Bob,6,
