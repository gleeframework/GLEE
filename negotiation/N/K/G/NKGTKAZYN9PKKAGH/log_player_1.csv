Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you've mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently unwilling to meet Alice's minimum price of $1,000,000.  While he's incrementally increasing his offers, it's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's acceptable to Alice within the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer ensures Alice receives her desired profit without further negotiation."
