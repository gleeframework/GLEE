Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear this is her final offer. While the product is worth more to her, it's unlikely she'll go below $12,000. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $10,000, it makes no financial sense to pay Alice more."
