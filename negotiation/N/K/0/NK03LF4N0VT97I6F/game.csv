"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to go lower?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $14,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $12,000? ",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and call it $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm offering the product to you for $13,250. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",13250.0,Alice,7,
