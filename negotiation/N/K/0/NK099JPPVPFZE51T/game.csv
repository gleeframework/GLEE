"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I'm on a tight budget and $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $10,500."
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider this price?",10000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $9,500? I'm hoping we can make a deal!",9500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,500. I'm willing to make a small concession, so I'm counteroffering $10,250. This is the lowest I can go."
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice. However, $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm counteroffering $10,000. This is my final offer, I'm afraid.",10000.0,Alice,5,,
