Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $15,000. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my goal."
