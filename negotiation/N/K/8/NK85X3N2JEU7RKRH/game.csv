Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a very competitive price considering its worth to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.,1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $850000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $975000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account the value it holds for you, while still allowing me to earn a decent profit.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $975000 is still a bit too high for me. Given my target price and the value of the product to me, I'm comfortable offering $900000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it benefits both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
