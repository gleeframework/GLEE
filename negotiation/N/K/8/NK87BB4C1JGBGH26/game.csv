"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a deal at $105. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $95, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a deal at $100. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
