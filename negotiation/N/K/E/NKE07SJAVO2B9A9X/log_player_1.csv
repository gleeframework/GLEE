Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  A price of $2,000,000 gives you significant room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value and the existence of other potential buyers, creating a sense of scarcity and urgency. 
* **Limited-Time Offer:** This encourages Bob to make a decision quickly and might make him less likely to negotiate down the price too much.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. Depending on Bob's response and your risk tolerance, you might adjust your approach in a real-world scenario."
