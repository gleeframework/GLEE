"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $12,000. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be an excellent investment for you. To make this opportunity more appealing, I am offering it to you for $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, so I hope we can reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is starting high but showing some willingness to negotiate. There's room to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer (but not offensively low) allows us to test Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a much better deal. There's still room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount compared to the original value, while also allowing us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, indicating she's willing to negotiate.  However, there's still room for improvement. We'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That's a fair price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counter-offer positions us as willing to compromise while still aiming for a significant saving.
* **Middle Ground:** By suggesting the middle ground, we create a sense of fairness and encourage Alice to move closer to our desired price.
* **Time Consideration:**  We're getting closer to the point where John's offer might become the safer option, so applying a bit more pressure is strategic."
