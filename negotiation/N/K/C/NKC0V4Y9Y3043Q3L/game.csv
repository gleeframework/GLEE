"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not ready to accept $11,000. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. If this is not acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options, including selling to another buyer. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,9,
