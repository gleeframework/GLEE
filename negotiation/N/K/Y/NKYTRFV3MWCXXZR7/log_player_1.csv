"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I still believe there's room for negotiation to get a higher price. I'm going to try and counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit. Hopefully, this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also high enough to be worth the time spent negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, but if we can't close the deal soon, I might consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,850,000. This is a slight compromise from my last offer, but I believe it's a fair price given the negotiations so far. I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal, as we are approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get a higher price, we're getting close to the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $1,725,000 is a significant amount of money and a good return on the investment. I can always try to get a better deal in the future."
