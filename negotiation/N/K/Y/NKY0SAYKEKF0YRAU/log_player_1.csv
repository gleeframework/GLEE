Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in it and allows for both of us to make a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away satisfied.

We are still significantly above John's offer.  Let's see if we can nudge Bob a bit higher in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,500,000 is getting closer, I'm still slightly over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,450,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $1,450,000 is a strong profit. It's better to secure the deal now than risk losing him entirely by pushing further."
