Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm thinking closer to $800,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me, and I'm still hopeful that we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $800,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,250,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle on $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I believe I can get a better offer, and I'll counter in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
