"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate hard, and I appreciate that! However, $7,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your price.  How about $8,000? That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,000 is getting closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm counteroffering at $9,500, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,7,
