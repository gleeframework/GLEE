{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know it's worth to me, but still lower than John's offer. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also shows I'm serious about selling and not just giving it away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to sell it to him than to John, I'm not willing to go below $150.  I'll counter his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested, but $120 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  If you're still interested, let me know. I'm open to further discussion."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his final offer of $130 is still below my minimum of $150.  I'll take John's offer, as it's a guaranteed sale at my minimum price."
