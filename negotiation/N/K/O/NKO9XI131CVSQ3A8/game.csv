"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a unique opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let me know your decision, as I have another buyer ready to pay $1,000,000 if you decline.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
