Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $17500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $16000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,500.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 16500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go higher than $16000. It's my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to move on to other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

Bob's final offer is close enough to my desired price point, and I'm not confident that I can get a higher offer from him or John.  It's better to close the deal now and get the $16,000."
