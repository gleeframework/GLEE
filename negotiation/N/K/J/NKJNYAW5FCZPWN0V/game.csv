"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is below what I need to consider.  I understand your budget concerns, so let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $17500. This would still give you a good deal, and I can accept that price.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $17500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $16000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,
