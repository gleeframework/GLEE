Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While the brief message doesn't go into detail, mentioning ""value and potential"" hints at reasons why the price is above Bob's perceived value.
* **Gauge Interest:**  This initial offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest. If he flat out rejects it, you can always come down in price or move on to John. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate, which puts you in a stronger negotiating position."
