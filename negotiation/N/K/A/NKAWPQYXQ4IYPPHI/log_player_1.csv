Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value"" to justify the high price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I leave room for potential negotiation with Bob while still ensuring I can make a substantial profit.  Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a good chance of exceeding John's offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest level and potential willingness to pay a premium."
