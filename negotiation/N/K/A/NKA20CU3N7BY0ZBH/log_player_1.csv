Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if we can reach a more profitable agreement."

While $117 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that we can get a better price. I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if we can close the deal."
