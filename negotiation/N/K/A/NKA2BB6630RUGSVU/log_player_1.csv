"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum, you set a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a price well above your $1,500,000 floor.
* **Confidence and Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" reinforcing its worth in Bob's mind. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  While starting high, you also signal a willingness to negotiate by inviting Bob's thoughts and positioning the initial price as a ""starting point."" 

This strategy aims to:

* Gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* Potentially secure a deal closer to your desired price.
* Establish a strong position for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is above your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than your initial ask. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Maintain Negotiation Leverage:** Accepting immediately might signal that you're willing to go much lower, limiting your ability to negotiate a better price. 
* **Explore Higher Potential:** There's still room to negotiate towards a price closer to your target. Bob's interest indicates he might be willing to go higher. 
* **Controlled Risk:** You have ample rounds remaining, and the option to sell to John for your minimum provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,600,000 is a serious offer, it's still below the value I place on this product.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I'm confident that at this price, you'll see an excellent return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're making a significant concession of $200,000 to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:** However, you're still holding firm above the $1,600,000 mark, signaling that you're not desperate and believe in the product's higher value. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message reiterates the potential return on investment for Bob, subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Encouraging a Counter:**  By making a substantial move, you're encouraging Bob to respond with a counteroffer that brings you closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Your Minimum:** Bob's offer now matches your absolute minimum selling price. While you could try to push for more, it's risky. 
* **""Fair"" Deal Emphasis:**  Bob is framing this offer as a compromise and a fair deal, potentially making him less likely to move significantly higher.
* **Time Value & Opportunity Cost:** Continuing negotiations has diminishing returns. Accepting now secures the sale and allows you to move on to other opportunities. 

While you could potentially get a slightly higher price from Bob with continued negotiation, accepting his offer of $1,500,000 is a low-risk, relatively high-reward move at this stage."
