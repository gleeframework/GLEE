"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness,  $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which reflects the value I see in it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit below my expectations, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering the product's value and your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's uniqueness and rarity.
