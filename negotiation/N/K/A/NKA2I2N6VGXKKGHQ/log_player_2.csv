Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but the product is worth a lot to me and $115 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $122? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $122 is closer to your target, you're still trying to save as much as possible.  You can likely get a lower price by continuing to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
