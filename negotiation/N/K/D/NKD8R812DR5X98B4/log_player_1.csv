Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really value. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95.  This is a good starting point because:

* It's above my minimum acceptable price of $80, maximizing my potential profit.
* It's below Bob's perceived value of $100, leaving room for negotiation. 
* I've added a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $95. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $90?  That's still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting a product worth $100 to you for less. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm getting closer to my minimum desired price of $80, and Bob's offer of $87.50 is a good compromise.  It's likely I won't be able to get a better price, and I'm happy to close the deal and secure the sale."
