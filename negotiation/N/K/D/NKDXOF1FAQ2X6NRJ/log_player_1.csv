Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I want a price close to $150, starting slightly lower at $145 gives Bob the impression of a deal and leaves me space to potentially negotiate upward.
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly is advantageous even if I could get a slightly higher price from John.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
