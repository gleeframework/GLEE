"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As the owner, I'm looking for a fair price for it, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $12,000. I believe this is a great value considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to reduce the price to $10,250, which is as low as I can go. This is still a great value for the product, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250.

Alice is very slowly lowering her price.  At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price significantly better than what John is offering. It makes more sense to buy from John for $10,000 and avoid further drawn-out negotiations."
