"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As the owner, I'm looking for a fair price for it, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $12,000. I believe this is a great value considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product looks great, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I do see the value in the product, $10,500 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to reduce the price to $10,250, which is as low as I can go. This is still a great value for the product, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
