"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. How about we aim for $750,000? I hope this proposal works for you.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $825,000? That leaves room for both of us to feel good about the deal. Let's make this happen!",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. How about considering $775,000 for the product? I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to continue working with you, but $775,000 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can offer. Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
