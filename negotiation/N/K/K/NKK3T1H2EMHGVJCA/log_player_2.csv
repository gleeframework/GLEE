"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe you might be interested in. I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm asking for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $140 is a bit high, and there's room for negotiation.  You can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $130?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 130}
