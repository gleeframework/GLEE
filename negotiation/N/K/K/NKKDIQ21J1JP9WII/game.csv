"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to close the deal at this price and move forward.",800000.0,Bob,4,
