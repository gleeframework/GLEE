"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $112.50? That's a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $108? That's the lowest I can go.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $108 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Let's compromise at $110. This way we both get a fair deal.",110.0,Alice,5,

"I'm close to accepting, but I'd like to try to get it a bit lower. How about $107? That's my final offer.",107.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $107 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $108.50.  This is a fair price for both of us and I believe it's a good compromise.",108.5,Alice,7,
