"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me, and significantly less than what I could get from another buyer.  I believe this product would be a valuable asset for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still higher than what Bob could get from John.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $1,000,000."
