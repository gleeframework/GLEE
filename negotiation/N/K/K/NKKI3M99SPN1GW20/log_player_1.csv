I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me some room to negotiate. It also signals that I'm confident in the value of the product and I'm not afraid to push for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I am willing to accept $1,200,000, but $1,100,000 is simply not enough. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to accept the deal, but I'm still willing to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price and I'm willing to accept it. I'm confident that I can still get a good deal even though it's not my ideal price."
