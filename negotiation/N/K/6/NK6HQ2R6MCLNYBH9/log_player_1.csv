"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price that's still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the benefit to Bob (""great deal considering its value to you""). 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving room for Bob to counter without feeling like he's being pressured.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  If Bob rejects, I can still go to John for the full $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's also far below the value I've assessed for the product.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it opens the door for further negotiation. I can use this opportunity to test his limits and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Avoiding a quick sale:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option, but I want to maximize my potential profit if possible.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob keeps that option open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This takes into account your value for the product and allows for a fair profit for me. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer but demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial price.
* **Focusing on value and fairness:** The message emphasizes both the value to Bob and the need for a fair profit on my end.
* **Setting a reasonable price:** $850,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but closer to a potential compromise point. 
* **Keeping the pressure on:** I'm not giving in completely, signaling that I'm prepared to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I have a firm budget. I can increase my offer slightly to $650,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $650,000 is still far from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's an increase from his last offer, it's not enough to make the deal worthwhile.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's message suggests he's willing to negotiate further, giving me more leverage to push for a better price.
* **John is still a backup:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob.  John is still a viable option if we can't reach a reasonable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $650,000 is still significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750,000.  This offers a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between our current positions. This signals a desire to reach an agreement while still remaining firm on my minimum.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  The message emphasizes how the deal is ""fair for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Positive language:**  ""Let's work together"" encourages cooperation and shows a willingness to reach a mutually agreeable outcome.
* **Closing pressure:**  ""Let's close this deal"" suggests a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to act now.

**Why not sell to John yet?** 

While I could sell to John for $1,200,000, I'm still trying to maximize my profit. $750,000 is still a considerable amount, and I believe there's a chance Bob might accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we settle at $700,000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While $700,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob's offer shows that he's still willing to negotiate and there's potential to push for a higher price. 
* **John is still a strong alternative:**  If we can't reach an agreement, I can still sell to John for a much higher price.  

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  I'll use language that emphasizes the value of the product to Bob and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $700,000 still doesn't fully reflect the value this product brings to your business.  To make this a true win-win, I'm willing to drop to $725,000.  This price recognizes your budget constraints while ensuring a fair return on my investment.  Let's finalize this deal and get you the product you need."", ""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise, Big Impact:**  A small drop to $725,000 shows I'm willing to compromise without significantly reducing my profits.
* **Focus on Value and Win-Win:**  The message emphasizes the value the product brings to Bob's business and highlights the mutually beneficial outcome of the deal.
* **Urgency and Finality:**  ""Let's finalize this deal"" creates a sense of urgency and implies that this is my final offer. 
* **John Still in the Back of My Mind:**  This offer is still well above Bob's original offer, and I can still sell to John for a much higher price if needed."
