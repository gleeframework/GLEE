"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This takes into account your value for the product and allows for a fair profit for me. Let's make this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I have a firm budget. I can increase my offer slightly to $650,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $650,000 is still significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750,000.  This offers a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's work together to close this deal.",750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we settle at $700,000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $700,000 still doesn't fully reflect the value this product brings to your business.  To make this a true win-win, I'm willing to drop to $725,000.  This price recognizes your budget constraints while ensuring a fair return on my investment.  Let's finalize this deal and get you the product you need.",725000.0,Alice,7,
