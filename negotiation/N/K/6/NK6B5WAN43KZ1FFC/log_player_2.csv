"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking $9,500 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below our $10,000 limit.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is framed politely to maintain a good negotiating relationship, but it clearly states that the initial offer is unacceptable and proposes a specific counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, $7,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  Could you do $8,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice moved a little from her initial offer, but $8,750 is still significantly above her value of $8,000. We can likely negotiate a better price. 
* **Continue Negotiating:** We have time and room to negotiate. Let's try to bring the price closer to the middle ground between her last offer and our last counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,800?"",
""product_price"": 7800
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise. It's almost exactly halfway between Alice's last offer ($8,750) and our previous counteroffer ($7,000).
* **Shows Willingness to Negotiate:**  By moving closer to her price, we signal that we're serious about the purchase but still want a fair deal. 
* **Maintains Buffer:**  Our offer keeps us comfortably below our $10,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I can tell you're serious about this product. How about $8,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Making Progress, But...** Alice is definitely moving closer to a price we like, but we're still above her $8,000 value. 
* **Time for Smaller Increments:** Since the gap is narrowing, we'll make a smaller counteroffer in the next round to show we're serious but still want a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to come up a little bit.  Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Her Value:** We know Alice values the product at $8,000. This offer aims to secure the product at her true value, which is a great deal for us.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The message acknowledges that Alice is a tough negotiator, which can help maintain a positive tone. It also implies that this is our best offer. 
* **Backup Option:**  If Alice rejects this offer, we can consider accepting her $8,250 price in the next round or sticking with our $8,000 offer. We're getting close to the point where John's $10,000 offer might become a more appealing alternative."
