"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a price higher than that."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000 for the product. This is still a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than her initial offer, he can still get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  There's no reason to pay more than that."

This price is fair considering the value it holds for me and my ability to purchase it elsewhere. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $1,125,000 for the product. This is still a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  Alice has already rejected two of Bob's counteroffers and her final offer of $1,125,000 is still higher than what Bob can get from John.  It's unlikely she will go any lower and continuing to negotiate would only waste time."
