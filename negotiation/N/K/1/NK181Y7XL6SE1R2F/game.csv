"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering I could purchase it elsewhere for $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000 for the product. This is still a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value this product, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for it.  This price is fair considering the value it holds for me and my ability to purchase it elsewhere. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $1,125,000 for the product. This is still a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
