"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000?  This still leaves you with a good profit margin, and it's closer to my value for the product. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle.  How about $1,175,000?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
