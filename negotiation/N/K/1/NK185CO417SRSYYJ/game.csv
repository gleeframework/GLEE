"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the $600,000 offer is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $900,000. This feels like a more reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're finding some middle ground.  How about we settle at $720,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value while working for me.",720000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and call it $810,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",810000.0,Alice,5,
