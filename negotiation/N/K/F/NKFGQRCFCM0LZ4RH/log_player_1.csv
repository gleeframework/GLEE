Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This price is a good compromise, as it's higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe this will incentivize Bob to accept the offer, as he'll still be getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $14,000. This is a slight reduction from my initial offer, but still a reasonable price considering my minimum.  I believe this compromise demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my value for the product."
