"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to offer it to you at a special price of $11,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $11,000 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are still trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,800 is a better price than the initial offer, you can still potentially get it for less.  You will continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,800 is still a little higher than my target price. I'm happy to pay $10,600 for the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've successfully negotiated the price down to $10,700, which is significantly lower than the initial price and closer to your target price. While you might be able to get it even lower with more rounds of negotiation, it's getting close to the time where you could be better off buying from John.  It's better to lock in a good deal now rather than risk losing it altogether."
