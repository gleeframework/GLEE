"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. It's worth $1,500,000 to Bob, but Alice is only asking for $1,400,000. This means there's room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is still profitable:** $1,300,000 is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Significant discount:** It's a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** The message is polite and expresses a desire to reach an agreement, keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $1,350,000.  This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice's counteroffer is a fair compromise. It's halfway between Bob's last offer and her previous offer.
* **Still within budget:** $1,350,000 is still within Bob's budget and a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **Time pressure:**  While more negotiation is possible, accepting this offer is a good way to secure the product and avoid potentially getting stuck with John's higher price if negotiations with Alice drag on."
