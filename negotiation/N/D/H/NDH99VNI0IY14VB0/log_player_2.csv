"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. $120 is too high, especially since you're willing to pay $150 from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $110, which is within my budget and a decent price considering the product's value to me.  Accepting her offer is the best option, as it saves me $40 compared to buying from John."
