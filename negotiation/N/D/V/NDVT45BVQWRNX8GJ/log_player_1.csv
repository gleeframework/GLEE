"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or potentially John in the future."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given your stated value for the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  There are still rounds left and I'm not yet willing to settle for an amount that is significantly lower than the value I place on the product.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price or possibly even get a better deal from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to stay closer to my minimum price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it, and I'm willing to make one more concession to get the deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While Bob has come up to $975,000, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. Since we're in the 6th round, and I'm not certain I can get a higher offer from Bob, it's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John."
