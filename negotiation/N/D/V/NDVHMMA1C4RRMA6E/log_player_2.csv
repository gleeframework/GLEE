"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get it for $12,000 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as she likely won't sell it for that high of a price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob should start by making a strong counteroffer, as close to his ideal price as possible.  He knows he can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more. This will likely make Alice realize she needs to come down in price to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price, and he can still get the product for $12,000 from John. He has time to negotiate with Alice and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob should increase his counteroffer slightly to $13,000.  He's shown he's serious about buying the product, but he's still significantly below Alice's price. This strategy gives him a chance to find a middle ground and get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's a slight decrease from her previous offer, it's still above his budget, and he can still get the product for $12,000 from John. He has time to keep negotiating with Alice and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob should increase his offer again to $14,000. He's showing Alice that he's willing to negotiate, but he's still below her price point. It's a good compromise, and Alice may be more willing to accept it, especially since they're getting closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's offer is still too high, and they've been at a standstill for a few rounds. It's clear she's not willing to come down to a price Bob is comfortable with.  At this point, it's more efficient to buy from John and save himself the time and potential frustration of further negotiations."
