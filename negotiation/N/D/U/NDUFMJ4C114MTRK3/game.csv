"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price, however,  $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  $1,400,000 is still quite a bit below what I had in mind. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  To be honest, $1,500,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal. ",1500000.0,Bob,6,
