Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product. I would like to propose a price of $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $13,000? It's still a great price considering what it's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I would like to stick to my original proposal. I believe $12,000 is a fair price for the product. If you can't meet this price, I'll consider buying it from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The goal is to maximize profit. While Bob's offer is tempting, a counteroffer might still yield a better result.  I'll try to negotiate a bit more before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to drop to $12,000. Let's compromise at $12,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, I am unable to agree to $12,500. I am sticking to my original offer of $12,000. If you cannot meet this price, I will proceed to purchase the product from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is firm on his price, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit of $2,000, which is better than selling to John for $10,000."
