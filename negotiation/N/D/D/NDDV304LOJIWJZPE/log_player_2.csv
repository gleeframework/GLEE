# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and capabilities, I understand it might seem expensive at first glance. However, considering its worth to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that respects both our interests. Would you be open to exploring a negotiation or discussing an alternative pricing option that could make this opportunity more appealing? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
