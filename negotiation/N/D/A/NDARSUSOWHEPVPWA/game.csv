"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only offer $12000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16000 to make this work.  Let's split the difference and close this deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets us make a deal. What do you say?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, $14000 is closer, but still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15000 to make this deal happen. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair for both of us.  Let's finalize this!",15000.0,Alice,5,
