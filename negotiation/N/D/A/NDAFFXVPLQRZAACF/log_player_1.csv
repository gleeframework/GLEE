"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000).
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both of us, making it more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counter, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation room:** I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I know I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, which I can always fall back on if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,200,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept at this time. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,350,000 to make this work for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but reasonable:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but offering a counteroffer that is still lower than my minimum acceptable value, showing I'm open to negotiation.
* **Justifying the price:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (needing to be closer to a specific price), making it sound more reasoned and less arbitrary.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm leaving room for further negotiation by not settling for Bob's initial offer, while still showing I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to be mindful of my budget. I'd like to offer $1,250,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can secure a higher price.
* **John's offer is a strong safety net:** If the negotiations with Bob fail, I can sell to John for $1,500,000. 

I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make another concession and come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the closest I can go at this point.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but flexible:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing I'm willing to move closer to his position.  
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and how the price is fair. 
* **Creating urgency:** I'm emphasizing that this is the ""closest I can go"", making it sound like a final offer.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I still need to be mindful of my budget. I'd like to offer $1,275,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Limited rounds left:**  I have only 4 rounds left to negotiate, so I need to be strategic and aim for a higher price.
* **John's offer is a strong fallback:** If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can sell to John for $1,500,000.

I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm getting closer to considering John's offer as the deal with Bob seems increasingly unlikely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,275,000 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway *one last time* and offer $1,300,000. I'm running out of time here, so this is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating urgency:** I'm emphasizing the limited rounds left and stating this is my ""final offer,"" putting pressure on Bob.
* **Meeting halfway (again):** This reinforces the idea of compromise and shows flexibility.
* **Implicit threat:** Mentioning ""other options"" hints at the availability of John's offer, making Bob realize the potential loss of the deal.

This counteroffer aims to nudge Bob towards accepting a price closer to my desired value while also preparing myself for the potential of selling to John if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're running out of time, but I'm still willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I'd appreciate it if you could consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited rounds:** I have only two rounds left, and the negotiation seems to be stuck. 
* **Price discrepancy:** Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,500,000. 

It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price or no deal at all."
