Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance with Bob before you go to John.

**The Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. A good strategy is to start near Bob's perceived value.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Why This Offer?**

* **Strong Opening:**  It positions the product as valuable and exclusive.
* **Near Bob's Value:** The $1,400,000 price is close to Bob's perceived value, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Room for Negotiation:** It leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further, while still keeping you well above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a strategy for how you'll respond."
