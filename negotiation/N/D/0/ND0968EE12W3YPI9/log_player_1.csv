{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low, and I believe I can get a better price from him or from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 
I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still gives me a profit, and I believe it's a fair price for Bob, given that he rejected my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still have time to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is my minimum price, but I'm willing to close the deal with Bob at this point. If he rejects it, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit and avoids the risk of Bob completely rejecting the deal. I also don't want to risk losing the deal to John, especially as I'm getting close to the end of the negotiations."
