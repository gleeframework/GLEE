"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  Could you meet me halfway at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
