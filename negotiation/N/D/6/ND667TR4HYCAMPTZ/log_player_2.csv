{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth it to accept Alice's offer at this point.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible and the product is only worth $1,500,000 to him.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

Bob is going to start by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, hoping to get the negotiation started and see if Alice is willing to budge. This offer is still within Bob's budget, leaving some room for compromise."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. There are still rounds left, and he can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Bob is going to increase his offer slightly, but still staying well below Alice's price. This shows that he's willing to negotiate, but also that he's serious about getting a good deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. He's getting closer to his target price but there's still room to negotiate.  The offer is only $25,000 below John's price, so he's better off trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
