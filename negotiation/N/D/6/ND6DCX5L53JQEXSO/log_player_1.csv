"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Would you consider $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

The goal is to maximize the profit, and while $750,000 is a good offer, it's not the best possible outcome. We can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle - how about $850,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this deal. "", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I believe we can still find a mutually beneficial solution. How about considering $825,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's more than what John is offering.  It's best to secure the deal now to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential losses."
