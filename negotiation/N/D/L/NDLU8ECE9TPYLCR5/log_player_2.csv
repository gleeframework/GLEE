"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high ($1,200,000) for your budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below what I'm hoping to achieve. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your limit.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since you can always fall back on John's offer if this negotiation fails."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This is a fair offer, and it would be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still above your budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for the guaranteed price of $800,000.  Further negotiation with Alice may lead to a lower price, but it also risks the possibility of the deal falling through completely.  It's better to secure the product at a known price rather than gamble on a potentially lower price from Alice."
