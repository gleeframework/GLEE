"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Can you consider that?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1700000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and value. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1700000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1500000. Can you consider that?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1500000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'll meet you at $1600000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1450000. Can you consider that?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $1450000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1550000. This is the final compromise I'm willing to make. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1550000 is your final compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $1420000. Can you reconsider?",1420000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already made a significant concession, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'll sell the product to you for $1485000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1485000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you've made a significant concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1400000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $800000.",1400000.0,Bob,10,
