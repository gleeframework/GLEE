"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is too high. Let's try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $120 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. We don't want to start too high and risk missing out on a good deal. By offering $60, we're signalling that we're serious about buying but need a much lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $60 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $90. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still too high. We'll continue negotiating and see if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $70?  That's a fair price for both of us, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

We're getting closer!  By countering with $70, we're splitting the difference between her last offer and our previous one.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward while demonstrating our willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $70 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $85. It's a good price, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is really close to our budget, but we can try one more time to see if she'll go down to $80. It's worth a shot before we default to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close!  I'd be happy to buy the product right now for $80.  It's a win-win!"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

We've reached our target price! This offer is firm but polite. We're letting Alice know this is our final offer and highlighting the mutual benefit of closing the deal now."
