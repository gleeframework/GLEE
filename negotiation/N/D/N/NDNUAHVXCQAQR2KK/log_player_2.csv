Alice's offer:

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay, but it's a bit closer. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further."

Alice's offer is still too high. It's closer to your budget, but you're running the risk of going back and forth for a while longer. It's more efficient to just buy from John at this point, as it's the price you're comfortable with."
