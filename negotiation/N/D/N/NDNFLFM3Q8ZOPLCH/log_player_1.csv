Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you and I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Above Minimum:** The offer is significantly higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price ($10,000).
* **Time Value:** While Alice has another buyer, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays or complications.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
