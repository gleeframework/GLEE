"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget and need to get the best deal possible. Is there any wiggle room in your price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to go a little further and meet you at $8,500.  This price is fair considering the value of the product, and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. It's the best I can do, so let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,5,
