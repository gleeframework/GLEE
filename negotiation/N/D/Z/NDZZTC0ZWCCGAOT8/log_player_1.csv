Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly implies that the price is justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding. Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal that Alice is open to discussing the price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has some reason to believe Bob might be willing to pay more than $10,000. If Alice has strong reason to believe Bob is very price-sensitive, she might consider a smaller initial offer."
