"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product is impressive, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I propose $1,300,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the immense benefits this product offers.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $650,000 is still a significant gap from where I see the value. This product is truly one-of-a-kind. To move this forward, I could consider $1,100,000. This offer reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, you're right, we both seem committed to finding a fair deal.  Let's aim for a final decision soon. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is my best offer, as I believe it fairly represents the immense value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",950000.0,Alice,7,
