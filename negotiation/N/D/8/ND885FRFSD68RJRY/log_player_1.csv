Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving a healthy profit margin for me. I'm confident in the value of my product and I'm willing to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a price that's closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough to justify the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, which is a safer and more reliable outcome."
