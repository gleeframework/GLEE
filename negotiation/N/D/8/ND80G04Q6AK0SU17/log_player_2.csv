Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $950,000. This is a very competitive offer, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $925,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and this price is below John's offer.  While we might be able to squeeze out a few thousand more by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk Alice will hold firm or we'll waste valuable time.  At $925,000, we're getting a good deal compared to our alternatives."
