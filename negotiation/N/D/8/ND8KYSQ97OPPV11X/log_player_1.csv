Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you'll be getting it for a significant discount, and I'll still be making a good profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:**  This price is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still allows for room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the mutual benefits of the deal. It also encourages Bob to respond quickly. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a high price:** The initial offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value, giving me a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Encourage further negotiation:** By presenting a deal as beneficial to both parties, I encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a more dynamic exchange.
* **Keep John's offer in mind:**  The threat of selling to John for $1,200,000 provides a safety net and sets a clear upper limit for my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and demonstrate that I am not desperate to sell.
* **Signal Willingness to Negotiate:**  Rejecting the offer doesn't mean I'm unwilling to sell to Bob.  It signals that I'm open to finding a compromise. 
* **Seek a Higher Price:**  In the next round, I'll propose a counteroffer closer to my minimum acceptable value, aiming to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and securing a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this work.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $950,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This price is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. It's a midpoint that signals my willingness to negotiate but still keeps the price above Bob's perceived value.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and reiterates the importance of a fair deal for both parties. It emphasizes the compromise nature of the offer, making it more appealing to Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer aims to narrow the gap between my desired price and Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** The offer still reflects my intention to get as close to my desired price as possible while remaining open to negotiation.
* **Avoiding a Deal Breaker:**  The counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, minimizing the risk of him walking away from the negotiation altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $925,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale, and further negotiation may not yield a significantly higher price.

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing Risk:**  Bob has clearly indicated that he won't go above $925,000.  Further negotiation may result in a stalemate, potentially leading to a sale to John.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I could continue negotiating, I'm considering the opportunity cost of doing so.  My time and effort are valuable, and accepting this offer allows me to move on to other opportunities.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  $925,000 is a significant profit, and it's closer to my desired price than I initially anticipated."
