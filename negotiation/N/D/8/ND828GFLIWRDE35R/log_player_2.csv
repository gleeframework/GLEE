"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is overpriced. We have plenty of room to negotiate and get a better deal.  We'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 
We are starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's value for the product. This leaves us room to negotiate further while aiming for a price well below Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about $100? That's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we can still negotiate further. We'll continue to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. Let's meet in the middle. How about $92?"",
""product_price"": 92
}
``` 

We are inching closer to a price that works for both of us. This offer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and the price John is offering."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $92 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $100.  Would you be willing to meet at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to stay above $90. While we might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, $95 is a reasonable price, significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price. It's time to accept and close the deal."
