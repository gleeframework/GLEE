"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. If Bob is truly interested, he'll likely counteroffer, giving us room to negotiate.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with $800,000, I'm not eager to accept Bob's first offer. He's clearly trying to lowball me.  I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to go higher.  I still have room to negotiate, and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a substantial profit. I believe $900,000 is a fair compromise, considering my minimum value and Bob's initial low offer. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price.  While it's still below what I initially aimed for,  it's only $50,000 less than my last counteroffer. I'm feeling confident that we can finalize the deal and I'm ready to accept."
