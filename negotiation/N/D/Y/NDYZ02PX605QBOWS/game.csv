,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm! While I'm interested,  $95 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to come down to $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $90, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $90 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit away from $87.50. I can meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. How about $92.50? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it!",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still too high for me. I'm ready to make a final offer of $88.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",88.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $89, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",89.0,Alice,7,
