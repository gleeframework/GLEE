"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is within your budget, it's not the best deal. You want to save as much as possible. By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm! While I'm interested,  $95 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to come down to $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I've proposed a price of $85, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Fairness:** $85 is still a decent profit for Alice (as the product is worth $80 to her),  while giving me a substantial discount.
* **Negotiation:** By offering a specific price, I'm inviting Alice to engage in further negotiation and potentially find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $90, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  $90 is still higher than my target price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not ready to accept this offer yet.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Alice has shown a willingness to lower her price, which suggests there's still room for compromise. 
* **Alternative:**  I can always buy from John for $100, so I'm not under pressure to settle for a price that's not satisfactory."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $90 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $85 and Alice's current offer of $90. This demonstrates a willingness to meet in the middle and find a solution.
* **Fair Value:** $87.50 is still a profitable price for Alice, as the product is worth $80 to her.  For me, it's a good deal as I'm getting it for less than my $100 alternative.
* **Negotiation:** By offering a specific price, I'm keeping the negotiation focused and inviting Alice to either accept or counter with a price closer to my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit away from $87.50. I can meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. How about $92.50? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Not Ideal:** While Alice is showing flexibility, $92.50 is still too high for me. I'm aiming for a price closer to $85, and this offer is closer to her original price. 
* **Continue Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate further. Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, so I can try to get her closer to my desired price.
* **Alternatives:**  I can always buy from John for $100 if we can't reach an agreement. This gives me some leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still too high for me. I'm ready to make a final offer of $88.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 88.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm using this counteroffer to signal that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I won't go any higher. 
* **Compromise:** $88.50 represents a compromise between my last offer of $87.50 and Alice's current offer of $92.50.
* **Fair Value:** This price is still profitable for Alice, and it's a good deal for me considering the alternative of buying from John for $100. 
* **Pressure:**  By calling it my ""final offer,"" I'm putting a bit of pressure on Alice to accept, as rejecting it means potentially losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $89, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $89 is very close to my target price of $85 and is a good deal compared to John's $100 offer.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there are only a few rounds left.  It's unlikely I'll get a significantly better offer.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting the offer allows me to buy the product and move on without risking the possibility of losing the deal or having to buy from John."
