"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's talk!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This still gives you a significant discount and allows me to recoup a reasonable portion of my investment.  Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think this is a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have your budget constraints. However, I am still not comfortable with your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $850000, but I'm not willing to go lower. This is a fair price, considering the value of this product for you. Let's aim for a win-win solution. ",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850000, but I'm afraid that's still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm offering $775000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to agree on a price. While I appreciate your efforts, I'm firm on my value for this product. To avoid further delays, I'm offering you my final counteroffer: $825000. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, and a fair compromise. If you're not willing to go that high, I'll be moving on to other offers. This is your last chance to secure this product.",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're firm on your value for the product, and I appreciate your willingness to make a final counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you at $800000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'd like to make a deal.",800000.0,Bob,8,
