"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'll see how Bob responds to this offer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is still too low.  While I'm running out of time, I'm going to hold out for a better price. I'll counteroffer again, and if that fails, I'll still have the option to sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price, considering he's already rejected several offers.  If he rejects this offer, I'll be forced to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject it. I have a few rounds left, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. If I don't get a better offer, I'll sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a compromise, as it's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum price. We're running out of time, and I'm hoping this is the offer that will finally convince Bob. If he rejects, I'll be forced to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John for $15,000. We're down to the last few rounds, and it's clear Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price.  It's not ideal to sell for less than my initial asking price, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking getting a lower offer."
