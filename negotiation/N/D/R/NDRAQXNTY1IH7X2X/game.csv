"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I'm sure will bring you great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000, which is a very competitive price considering its worth to you is $800000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort you've put into finding a solution that works for both of us. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows me to acquire the product within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1050000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering its value to you is $800000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1050000, but I need you to meet me halfway. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $975000 is enough. I'm willing to make one more attempt to reach a deal with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1075000, which is my final concession. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the end of the road, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a deal with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000, but I need you to meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1100000.0,Alice,9,
