"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $775,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $775,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm offering you the product for $825,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000.
