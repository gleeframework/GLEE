{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message and proposes a price that is a bit lower than the product's value to Bob, but still higher than the value to me, giving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is a decent price, I'm still aiming to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I'm sure you'll still get a good deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $132 is close to my ideal price, and it's a good deal for me. While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk he'll walk away, and I'd have to settle for John's offer of $120.  It's better to accept this offer and secure a good profit."
