Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This price would still be a good profit for you and leave me room to make a profit as well. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price with a counteroffer."
