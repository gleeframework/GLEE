"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still a significant amount above Alice's value of $8,000.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $11500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's desired price range, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to push the price down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you at $11500, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice is firm:** Alice has stated that she won't go lower than $11,500.  
* **Value vs. Risk:** At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high.  There's no guarantee that Alice will budge, and Bob might end up paying more with John's $15,000 price. 
* **Reasonable Price:** While $11,500 is more than Bob's initial target, it's still a good deal compared to John's price and a fair compromise considering Alice's stance.

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking a deadlock or ending up paying more with John."
