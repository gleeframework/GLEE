"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Bob has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible. Since Alice values the product at $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price. 
* **Backup Option:** Bob has a backup option with John, which means he's not under pressure to accept the first offer. 

By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a price closer to Alice's valuation and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Considering your valuation, I'd like to offer you $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise.  Here's why Bob should accept:

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate. Accepting this offer is a reasonable compromise.
* **Lower Than John's Price:**  $1,100,000 is still significantly less than the $1,200,000 Bob would pay John. This means Bob is still saving a substantial amount of money. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further.  He could risk losing the deal altogether or being forced to pay John's higher price.

By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product at a favorable price and avoids potential complications or delays."
