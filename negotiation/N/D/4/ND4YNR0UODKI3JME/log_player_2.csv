Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $25,000 above my last counteroffer.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of going back and forth outweighs the potential savings. Accepting this offer saves $425,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal, and I should secure it."
