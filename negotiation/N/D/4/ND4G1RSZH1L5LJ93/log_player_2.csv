Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $100 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $175?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with $130. How about we try $165? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165

It's time to cut our losses.  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $165, and we can get the product for $150 from John."
