"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a strong opening position, leaving room for negotiation while still making it clear that I value the product highly.  Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, he has incentive to negotiate and try to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value for the product. I want to see if I can push for a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a price above my minimum. This shows flexibility but also reinforces my belief in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to see if I can squeeze out a bit more with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm offering $1,025,000. This is another compromise, showing continued flexibility but still pushing for a price that's closer to my desired outcome. We're getting close, and I think this offer might be enough to get Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, and while Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to satisfy my goal of maximizing my profit. To avoid the risk of Bob continuing to lowball me, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,000,000. This guarantees me a decent profit and avoids further uncertainty."
