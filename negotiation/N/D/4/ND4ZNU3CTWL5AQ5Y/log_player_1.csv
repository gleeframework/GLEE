Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, but still leaves room for potential compromise. It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's a good chance he'll be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still secure a better price by rejecting and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, but I've lowered it a bit to show willingness to negotiate. It's important to balance pushing for a higher price with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer is now the best option.  The risk of continuing the negotiation with a counteroffer is that he might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $800,000. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale that's significantly higher than John's."
