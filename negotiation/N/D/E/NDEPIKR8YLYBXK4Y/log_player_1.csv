"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love!  I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and enthusiastic to build rapport.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I'm prompting Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum price of $100.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $100 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming for a bit more for this product. Would you be willing to pay $105? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum but lower than my initial offer. 
* **Positive messaging:** I'm using positive language to maintain a friendly tone and encourage Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, hoping he'll see the deal as worth the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your follow-up offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still committed to staying within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $98 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $2 below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a good chance Bob will walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $100.
* **Time pressure:**  We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk running out of time.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and minimizes my potential loss."
