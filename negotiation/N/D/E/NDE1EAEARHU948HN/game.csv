"Dear Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're offering, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
