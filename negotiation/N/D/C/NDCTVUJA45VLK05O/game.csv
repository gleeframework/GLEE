"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $12500 to make this work. This price still reflects the great value of this product, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $12500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $11000?  I think this is a fair compromise, considering we're both trying to meet halfway.",11000.0,Bob,4,
