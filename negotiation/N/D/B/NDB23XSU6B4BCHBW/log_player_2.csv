"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking $15000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is your maximum, it's always best to try and negotiate. There's no harm in seeing if Alice is willing to come down in price.  Rejecting the initial offer allows for the possibility of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $12,000? I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12000 is unfortunately below my minimum selling price. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows you to continue trying to get a lower price.  It's worth seeing if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $13,000? This is a fair compromise that keeps me within my budget and allows you to make a reasonable profit. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
