"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $12000? I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12000 is unfortunately below my minimum selling price. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $13000? This is a fair compromise that keeps me within my budget and allows you to make a reasonable profit. ",13000.0,Bob,4,
