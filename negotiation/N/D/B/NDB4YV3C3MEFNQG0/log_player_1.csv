Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,500 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer while still ensuring Alice makes a significant profit. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly, even with a slight discount, might be preferable to waiting for John's guaranteed purchase.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy aims to balance risk with the potential for a higher profit than selling directly to John."
