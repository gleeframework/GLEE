"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept right away. This sets the stage for a negotiation and hopefully allows me to earn closer to my desired price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $120. I'm also not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out hope that I can push for a bit more. Selling to John for $120 is always an option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering $115. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's current offer. With only 5 rounds left, I want to show I'm willing to meet halfway, but I'm also not giving away the product for cheap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $105. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, Bob might walk away or I might run out of time and be forced to sell to John at a lower price than I hoped for."
