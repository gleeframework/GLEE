"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum price of $100. There's no reason to accept it.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the maximum price I'm willing to pay.  This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept and make a small profit, or risk losing the sale and having to negotiate further.  I'm also setting a clear boundary and demonstrating my commitment to not exceeding my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget.  While I'd prefer to pay less, accepting this offer saves me the time and potential hassle of further negotiation.  It's also a good compromise since Alice is dropping her price and I'm getting a decent deal."
