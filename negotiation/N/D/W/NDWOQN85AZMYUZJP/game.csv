"Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1300000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1300000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. How about $1450000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
