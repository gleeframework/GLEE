"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $12,000. This is far above Bob's desired price.  He should counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $10000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, $10,000 is still more than he's willing to pay. He should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I need a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $9500? It's a great price, and I think you'll love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's tempting, $9,500 is still a bit too high for him. He should try to negotiate further and see if he can get Alice closer to his target of $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really want to work with you, but $9,500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm on $9,000.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really serious about this, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9250? It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there are only three rounds left and he's unlikely to get her to agree to $9,000.  Since John is offering the product at his maximum price, it's the safest option to avoid potentially spending more than necessary."
