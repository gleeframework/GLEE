"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",175.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $140? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price is fair for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $140. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $155. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $155 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a better deal.  How about $150?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's the maximum I'm willing to spend.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot by offering $155 earlier. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $152. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can understand that.",152.0,Alice,5,
