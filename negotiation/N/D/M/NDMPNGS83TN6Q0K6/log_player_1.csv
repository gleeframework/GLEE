"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and benefits, aiming to justify the high asking price.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price. This knowledge gives me confidence to start high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price seems a bit high to me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting this would be a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While the first offer was rejected, there's still room to negotiate upwards from Bob's counteroffer.  We have 8 rounds remaining, and I can work towards a more reasonable price. 
* **Backup Option:** The option to sell to John for $1,500,000 provides a safety net, allowing me to negotiate confidently with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective on the price, $800,000 falls quite short of what I can agree to.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** Bob's offer was extremely low, so I'm making a significant move towards the middle ground between our previous positions. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **Justification:** I've framed the counteroffer as a ""fair"" compromise, appealing to a sense of balance in the negotiation.
* **Strategic Retreat:**  While a large decrease from my initial offer, $1,800,000 is still comfortably above both Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Critical Point:** Bob has now offered his perceived value of $1,000,000. While it's a significant jump from his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** By rejecting this offer, I am signaling that I'm serious about my valuation and putting pressure on Bob to move significantly closer to my range.
* **John as Leverage:** The standing offer from John for $1,500,000 gives me a strong alternative if Bob is unwilling to negotiate further. I'm willing to walk away from the deal with Bob if he doesn't increase his offer substantially."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product brings. I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and as low as I can go.  Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I need to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm presenting this as my ""final offer"" to create urgency and signal that I'm nearing my limit. 
* **Slight Concession:** I'm reducing my price slightly to $1,600,000 to show some flexibility and encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Introducing Alternatives:** By mentioning ""other options,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob about John's standing offer, adding pressure to his decision-making process.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still above my minimum while leaving minimal room for further negotiation. This either pushes Bob to accept a price closer to my target or leads to the negotiation ending, allowing me to proceed with John."
