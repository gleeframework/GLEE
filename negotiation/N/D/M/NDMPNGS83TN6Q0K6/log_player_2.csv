"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered and the benefits it will bring you.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price seems a bit high to me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective on the price, $800,000 falls quite short of what I can agree to.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product brings. I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and as low as I can go.  Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I need to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to go much lower than $1,600,000. It's a good negotiating tactic to leave the option of John's offer open, as it's our best-case scenario. By buying from John, we save a significant amount of money."
