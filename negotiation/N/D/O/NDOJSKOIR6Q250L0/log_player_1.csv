Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe you'll find it to be a great value at this price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($120).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $140 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you're guaranteed $120 from John. Therefore, the offer to Bob must aim for a higher profit."
