Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $1,500,000, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point, potentially making your fallback price of $1,000,000 (if he negotiates) seem more reasonable. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high offer allows room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than $1,000,000.

**Important:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you know about Bob (e.g., his negotiation style, how badly he needs the product), you could adjust your offer."
