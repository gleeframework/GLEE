"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  How about $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. I see the value you see in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $11,000.** This is still a better price than buying from John for $12,000.
* **The negotiation process is likely to continue**, and Alice may not be willing to go lower. 
* **Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that is within Bob's budget and a better deal than John's offer.**  There's a risk that Bob might be able to get a lower price, but also a risk of losing the deal altogether if he keeps rejecting offers."
