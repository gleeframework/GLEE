"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  While $1,200,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit lower than where I need to be.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,300,000? This allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
