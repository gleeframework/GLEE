,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $9,800 still leaves me too far from what I need. How about $10,000? I'm sure you'll agree that this is a fair price, and we can close the deal. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
