Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value. It leaves room for negotiation while still being advantageous to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept such a low price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? This would still be a good deal for you, as you've mentioned the product is worth $10,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still quite a bit below my minimum. Let's split the difference.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  This would ensure a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
