Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your confidence in the product, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $700000 for it, reflecting its potential value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.
