"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for me. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still higher than what John is offering.  It's better to secure the product at the lowest possible price, even if it means closing the deal with a different seller."
