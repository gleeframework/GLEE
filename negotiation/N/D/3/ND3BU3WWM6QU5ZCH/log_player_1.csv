"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds immense value for you, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your endeavors. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** The message is designed to be positive and  understand Bob's initial reaction and willingness to negotiate.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less. I'm happy to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'm willing to engage in further rounds of negotiation to explore if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've shown a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but I'm holding firm above Bob's offer to signal I'm seeking a higher amount.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":**  This framing technique often feels fair to both parties and can help move negotiations toward a close.
* **Time Consideration:**  While I have several rounds left, I want to progress efficiently and see if Bob is serious about a deal closer to my desired range."
