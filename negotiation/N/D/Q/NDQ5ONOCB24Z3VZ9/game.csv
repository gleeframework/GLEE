"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price.

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price you proposed doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000. I believe this price point is fair and reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from owning this.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
