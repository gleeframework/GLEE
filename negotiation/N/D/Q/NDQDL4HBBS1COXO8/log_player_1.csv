Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value of the item, but I'm currently working within a budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $8,000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer because it's too low. I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price, and I'm still confident I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to what I'm looking for, I'm not willing to drop that low yet. I'm confident I can get a better price, and with 6 rounds left, I have time to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still hopeful we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good deal for you as well. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8800}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I believe we can reach an agreement. Would $8,600 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and $8,600 is a decent deal. It's important to remember that I'm still getting more than Bob is willing to pay, and I'm less likely to get a better offer with only 4 rounds left.  Plus, there's always the risk of Bob walking away completely or me having to sell to John for $10,000, which would net me less profit."
