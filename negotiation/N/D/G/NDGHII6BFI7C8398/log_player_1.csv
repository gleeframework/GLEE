Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  This allows room for negotiation if Bob is interested but wants a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is still a good amount for me, and it's a more reasonable compromise compared to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is more than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. If Bob doesn't accept this, I'll sell to John for the same price."
