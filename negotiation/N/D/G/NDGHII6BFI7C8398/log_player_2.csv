"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $15,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is too high. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
``` 
 
Bob is trying to get the best deal possible and is willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product. By offering $10,000, he is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, making a clear statement about his desired price point. It's a bold move, but it could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's limit, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue trying to get a better price. He can either counter-offer again or consider buying from John if he believes Alice won't budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
``` 
 
Bob is showing a willingness to compromise but still holding firm to his budget. Offering $13,000 shows he is serious about the deal, but it also leaves room for Alice to meet him halfway.  This counter-offer is a strategic move, aiming for a quick resolution while staying within Bob's financial limits."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum price point of $15,000. It's not ideal, but it's the best he can get from Alice.  There's no point in rejecting and risking Alice changing her mind or escalating the price again.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
