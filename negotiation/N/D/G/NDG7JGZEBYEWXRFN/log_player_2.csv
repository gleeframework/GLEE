It's always worth trying to negotiate further. You can potentially save $100,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

I'm starting with a significant discount, aiming for a price point that's still attractive to me but leaves room for Alice to negotiate."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

``` 

Alice has come down to $850,000 which is a good price for me. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and potentially increasing her price. It's better to secure the product at this price point."
