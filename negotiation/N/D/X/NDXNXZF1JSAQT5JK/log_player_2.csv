"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm initially offering it for $1,100,000. This is a unique asset, and I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

The product is worth more to Alice than to me, and she's starting at a price I can't accept. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. I believe this price reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business while still recognizing its worth in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to try another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still outside of my comfortable range. I'm willing to go up to $925,000 for the product. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in this product. I believe a compromise in this range is possible, and I'm confident that this agreement will benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, $1,200,000 is the lowest I can go for this product.  I have another buyer ready at that price, but I believe in giving you the first opportunity. If you're unable to meet that price, I understand, and we can part ways amicably. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice is unwilling to budge from her price, and it's clear she's not interested in negotiating further. My budget doesn't allow me to meet her price. It's time to move on and buy the product from John for $800,000."
