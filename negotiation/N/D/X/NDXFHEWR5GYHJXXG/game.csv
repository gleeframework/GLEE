"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $1,200,000. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but unfortunately, I am still unable to meet you halfway. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. This is the highest amount I can afford while still ensuring profitability for my business.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I value your business, $1,400,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to lower my price slightly further to $1,600,000.  I believe this price represents a good compromise and a solid investment for you. Let's try to reach a final agreement on this round.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
