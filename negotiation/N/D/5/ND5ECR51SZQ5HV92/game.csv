"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1400000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1600000? This is a significant discount, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1300000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $1500000 is my absolute bottom line. This is a significant discount considering the value this product offers. Let me know if you're able to come up to that price. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1500000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1350000. I'm really interested in this product, and I think it's worth the investment, but I need to stay within my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
