Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget right now. I'd be happy to pay $950,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're on a tight budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This way, I can still make a decent profit, and you'll get a great deal on the product."", ""product_price"": 1025000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. How about we meet at $1,050,000? This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
