"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll love it, but I need to make a fair profit. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's worth negotiating to see if we can get a better price.  We have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget right now. I'd be happy to pay $950,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount. This is a good starting point for negotiation. It's important to show Alice that I'm serious about buying, but I'm also not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're on a tight budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This way, I can still make a decent profit, and you'll get a great deal on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate, as we have several rounds left and the offer from John is still a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going for the John's offer price, which is my maximum. It's a strong counter-offer that signals I'm serious but won't go higher. It also positions Alice to accept, given she'd make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. How about we meet at $1,050,000? This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still higher than John's price.  We've negotiated for a few rounds, and it's clear Alice is not willing to drop down to my target price.  It's more beneficial to buy from John at this point, as it saves me $50,000."
