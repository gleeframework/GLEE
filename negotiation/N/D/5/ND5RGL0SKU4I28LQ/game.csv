"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1500000 to you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1300000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for it, which is still above your stated value of $1200000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1250000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your offer, but still reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1275000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth $1500000 to you.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
