Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I know the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, starting with a higher offer of $10,000 leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob might accept the $10,000 price, netting a higher profit.
* **Fallback Option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $8,000."
