Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is getting closer to my preferred price, she's still above my $120 limit. John offers the product at my target price, so it makes more sense to buy from him now rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
