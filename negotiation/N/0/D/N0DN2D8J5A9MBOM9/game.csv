"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product is valuable, but your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you think the product is valuable, but it's worth more than $1,100,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. Is this more in line with what you're willing to pay?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,220,000?",1220000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,250,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Is this a deal-breaker for you, or are you willing to meet me at this price?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
