Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay a higher price than $8,000, which is what I could get from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to sell for $8,000, I believe I can do better. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price that's more beneficial to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise that still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $8,500.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, this is still a good deal for me. It's higher than what I could get from John, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale altogether."
