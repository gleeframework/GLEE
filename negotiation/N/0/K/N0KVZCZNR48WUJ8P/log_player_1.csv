Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The price gives Bob room to negotiate while staying well above my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation.

By starting high, I aim to anchor the negotiation in my favor. I'm prepared to adjust my price based on Bob's response while always keeping my bottom line in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer.  I believe the product is valuable but the price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I know John is ready to buy at that minimum, so there's no reason for me to accept a loss.  I will counter-offer in the next round, aiming to move the negotiation closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection with Justification:** I'm politely rejecting Bob's offer while explaining that it undervalues the product. 
* **Significant Concession (Appear Flexible):** By dropping $100,000, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate and potentially encouraging Bob to make a more reasonable counteroffer. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  This counteroffer remains comfortably above my walk-away price, allowing room for further negotiation if necessary.

I believe this approach strikes a balance between firmness and flexibility, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 now matches my minimum acceptable price and what John is willing to pay.  There's no benefit to further negotiation or risking losing the sale.  Accepting this offer guarantees I achieve my goal of selling the product at a price I find acceptable."
