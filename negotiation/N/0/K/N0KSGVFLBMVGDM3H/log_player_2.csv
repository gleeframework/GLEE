Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) than Alice's asking price. This gives us room for negotiation and allows us to gauge her flexibility. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product.  We don't want to offend Alice or make her think we're not serious about buying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved from her initial offer, $9,000 is still significantly higher than our target price. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to a price we're comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we settle at $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer from $6,000 to $7,000, showing Alice that we're willing to move closer to her price range.
* **Targeting the Midpoint:** This offer aims for a price closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and her counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Communication:** We're keeping the tone positive and collaborative, aiming for a mutually agreeable outcome."

Round 5

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a smaller increase in our offer this time ($500) to show that we're reaching our limit, but still willing to negotiate.
* **Firm but Fair:** The message emphasizes fairness and our serious intent to purchase, signaling that this offer is close to our final position.
* **Time Consideration:**  As we approach the halfway point in the negotiation rounds, we need to apply a bit more pressure to avoid running out of time and having to default to John's offer."
