Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get a better price while still being competitive with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $120.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 110}
