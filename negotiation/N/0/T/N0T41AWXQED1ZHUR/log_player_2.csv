"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always best to try and negotiate a lower price. Since you have 10 rounds and a backup option with John, there's no reason to accept the initial offer.  Rejecting allows you to explore if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and sets the stage for a back-and-forth process.  I'm confident I can still get a good deal, even if Alice rejects this initial counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still a significant amount. I want to see if she's willing to come down further.  I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since I have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, but I want to see if I can close the gap further.  A counteroffer of $800,000 represents a compromise between our previous positions, and I believe it's a fair price given the limited rounds and the backup option."
