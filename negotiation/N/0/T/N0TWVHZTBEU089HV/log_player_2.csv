"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price.** You're willing to pay $120 maximum, and Alice is asking for $110. 
* **You have room to negotiate.**  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a significant drop:**  Dropping from $110 to $95 shows you're serious about negotiating and willing to compromise.
* **Be polite and frame it positively:**  Instead of saying ""that's too high,"" focus on finding a fair price for both of you.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  $95 is still above Alice's $80 value, allowing for potential concessions from her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is still lower than I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your comfort zone.** You're willing to pay a maximum of $120, and she's offering $105. 
* **You're still in a good position to negotiate.** By rejecting her offer, you can continue to try and get a lower price. 
* **You have 7 rounds left.**  You can afford to continue negotiating without rushing into a deal that's not in your best interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $105 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $100. I think this would be a fair price and allow us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Another significant drop:**  Continuing to drop your price shows you're serious about making a deal and encourages Alice to do the same. 
* **Staying within your budget:** $100 is still within your maximum price point, but leaves room for potential compromise.
* **Framing it as a win-win:**  Emphasizing that this price is fair for both of you can be persuasive."
