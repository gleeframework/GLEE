"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your feedback. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground â€“ how about $11,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $11,500 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $9,500? I think that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? It's a competitive offer considering its value.",10500.0,Alice,5,
