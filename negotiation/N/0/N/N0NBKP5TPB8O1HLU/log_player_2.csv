"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for a price of $1000000. I believe it has incredible potential for your business, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let's discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation, so I'll reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Considering the potential value of the product, I'd be willing to pay $800,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and potentially find a price we can both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $800000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $900000 to demonstrate my commitment to this deal. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a way to bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $900,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. However, I'm still significantly below Alice's current offer, leaving room for further negotiation. This approach shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also determined to get a good deal."
