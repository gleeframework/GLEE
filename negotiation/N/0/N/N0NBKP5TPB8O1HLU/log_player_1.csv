Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for a price of $1,000,000. I believe it has incredible potential for your business, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, as I want to maximize my potential profit. However, I'm also including a message that acknowledges Bob's potential interest and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is a bit high for me. Considering the potential value of the product, I'd be willing to pay $800000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $1,000,000. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to demonstrate my commitment to this deal. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it's still outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $850000.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is very close to my desired outcome.  While I could potentially get more by continuing to negotiate, the risk of a counteroffer being rejected by me, leading to a sale to John for $800,000 is too high.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a profitable sale and avoids the potential of losing a valuable deal."
