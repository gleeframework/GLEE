{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your operations, potentially saving you significant costs in the long run.  I'm asking for $1,100,000, which reflects its true worth and potential ROI. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting us closer to our ideal price.
* **Highlight Value, Not Just Price:** The message focuses on the product's benefits and potential return on investment for Bob, rather than just stating a number. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This offer allows us to gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects this initial offer, it might not be worth significant negotiation, and we can move on to John."
