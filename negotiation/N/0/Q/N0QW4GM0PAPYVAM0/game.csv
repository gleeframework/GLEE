"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal. Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're looking for the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I can't go lower than $9,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm confident that you'll find it a worthwhile investment, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,5,
