"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You are aiming for a price of $800,000 or lower. $900,000 is significantly higher than your target.
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation as Alice values the product at $1,000,000, and you have 10 rounds to get a better deal.

**Next Steps:** 

You should counter with a price lower than $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your seriousness about getting a good price.
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  It also allows for potential negotiation in the following rounds if Alice needs to compromise.
* **Still within your budget:**  This price is within your target range, but still gives you some leeway if Alice counters with a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** $875,000 is only $75,000 above your desired price of $800,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** Alice has already lowered her price from $900,000 to $875,000, and you've already countered once. Further negotiation may be difficult. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you reject this offer and continue negotiating, Alice could potentially become unwilling to sell at your desired price, or you might run out of rounds before reaching an agreement.

**It's a good idea to lock in a price close to your target to avoid the risk of missing out on the product altogether.**"
