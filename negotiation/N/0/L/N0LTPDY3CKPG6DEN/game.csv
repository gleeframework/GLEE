"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider coming down a little further, say to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
