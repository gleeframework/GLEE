"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you. To make this a swift deal, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your confidence. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This still allows me to secure the product within my financial limits while acknowledging its worth.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understanding of the product's value.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,200,000 is a bit too low considering the potential returns we've discussed.  How about we meet halfway at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I see that we're still working towards a mutually beneficial agreement, Alice. I value the product and the opportunity, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to counter your offer at $1,225,000. This is the highest I can go while still ensuring I can afford other necessary expenses.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that avoids further back and forth.  I'll come down slightly to $1,240,000. This offer reflects the product's true value while respecting your budget concerns.  I believe it's a fair compromise to close the deal.",1240000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I respect your position and the value of the product. I would like to counter your offer at $1,230,000. This price still allows me to consider the product's worth while staying within my financial limits.",1230000.0,Bob,6,
