Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but the product is worth significantly more to me than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $170?"", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $170 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $140 is a good compromise. It's significantly more than his initial offer and allows me to make a profit.  There's no guarantee I could negotiate a better price with him, and it avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
