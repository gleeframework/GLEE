"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $12,000 is less than I'm hoping for. Would you consider $15,500? This is a very competitive offer for a product of this quality.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice,  $15,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $15,000.  Would you be willing to do $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,6,
