"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I consider its true worth.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This reflects my desire to make a deal while still recognizing the product's significant value.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
