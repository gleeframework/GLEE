Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** By starting at $200, we can see how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We always have John as a backup buyer at $150, so there's no risk of going below our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $150. While we want to maximize profit, accepting this offer would result in a loss. We know John is willing to pay $150, making it more profitable to negotiate further with Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, however, the product's value is considerably higher than that.  Could you consider $180?  I believe that's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 180
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We significantly decreased our asking price from $200 to $180, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer is still comfortably above our minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring profitability. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer helps gauge how serious Bob is about purchasing and how flexible he is on price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $180. How about $150? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $150 matches our minimum acceptable price and is equal to what John is offering.  There's no benefit to further negotiation or going with John since the outcome is the same. Accepting this offer secures the sale at our desired profit margin."
