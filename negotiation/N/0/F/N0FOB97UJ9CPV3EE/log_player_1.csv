"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's important to establish a strong starting point. By starting high, I'm signaling the value I place on the product and leaving room for negotiation. 

This strategy also helps me gauge Bob's interest level. If he rejects this offer outright, it indicates that the product likely isn't worth that much to him. This would give me valuable information to inform my future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000. While I need to be strategic in my negotiations, I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this stage. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round and try to bridge the gap between our valuations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is still above my minimum value, but it's a considerable step down from my initial offer. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, while also keeping a reasonable profit margin. I'm hoping this counteroffer is appealing enough for Bob to consider, and I believe it leaves room for further negotiation in the upcoming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly my minimum value for the product. While I'd prefer to earn more, accepting this offer is the most rational choice. 

Here's why:

* **Meeting minimum value:**  I'm guaranteed to receive at least my minimum value.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Rejecting this offer opens up the possibility of Bob counter-offering again, potentially at a lower price. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Every round of negotiation takes us further away from a deal. By accepting this offer, I can secure the sale and avoid potential delays or complications.

While I might be able to squeeze out a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of a lower counteroffer from Bob or running out of time makes accepting his current offer the most strategic choice."
