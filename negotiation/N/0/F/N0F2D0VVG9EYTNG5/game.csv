,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product and understand your budget.  While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $90? I'm really hoping we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
