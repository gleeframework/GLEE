Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a good strategy to start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:**  I provide a reason for the price, making it seem more legitimate than just throwing out a random number.
* **Open-Ended:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation going.

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer. I'll need more information about Bob's reactions and counteroffers to adjust my strategy and maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, he's shown interest in the product. This gives me an opportunity to negotiate a more favorable price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.  I'll need to carefully consider what price to offer, taking into account Bob's initial offer and my desire to maximize my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110? That would still give me some room to make a profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is a compromise between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the price, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Keep It Open:** The message leaves room for further negotiation if needed.

**Strategy:**

By offering $110, I'm testing the waters to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price range. If he rejects, I'll need to consider my options carefully, including potentially accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $80.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.  If not, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Room for Negotiation:**  Bob has made it clear he won't go above $80, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **John's Offer:** John is willing to pay $120, which is a better deal for me than selling to Bob for $80.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his insistence on a price that's too low for me makes it clear that further negotiation is unlikely to be successful. Accepting John's offer is the best way to maximize my earnings in this situation."
