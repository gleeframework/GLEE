{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a very unique product I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it. It's a significant investment, but I believe it has the potential to be very valuable for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider it. However, based on my current financial situation and valuation of the product, I am not able to meet the asking price of $1500000. I would like to propose an offer of $1400000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is a good price, I believe I can do better.  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, and I still have 9 rounds to do so."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,400,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the potential value of the product.  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I still think I can get a better price, and I have 6 rounds left to negotiate. I'm willing to compromise, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my initial asking price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While I value your offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,450,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,437,500. This is a fair price, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1437500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort in finding a common ground. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose an offer of $1430000. I hope this proposal will be more in line with your expectations.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,430,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal, we're now only $7,500 apart. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of getting a lower price from Bob or needing to sell to John for $1,000,000 is too high.  $1,430,000 is a good deal and I'm going to take it."
