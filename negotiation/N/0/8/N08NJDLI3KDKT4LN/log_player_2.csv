"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $2,000,000 is far beyond Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It makes sense to counter-offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  This is a serious offer and I'm confident it's fair considering the market value."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the product's exceptional value and leaves room for a win-win. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue to try and bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This offer acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer, but I believe this deal makes sense for both of us. I'm willing to finalize at $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you're receiving. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. While Alice has come down significantly, $1,550,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's time to cut his losses and move on to a more affordable option."
