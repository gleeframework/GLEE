"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $10000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $7500 for it. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $7500 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9000.  This price reflects the product's real value and allows for some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $9000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $8500, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and our negotiation history. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
