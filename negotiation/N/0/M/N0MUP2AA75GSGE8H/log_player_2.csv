Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $10000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $7,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $7500 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9000.  This price reflects the product's real value and allows for some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
