"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point seems a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This feels like a fair compromise that still reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
