"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth $100 to you and we're confident it will meet your needs perfectly. We're offering it to you for $95 today. This is a special opportunity to get a high-quality item at an attractive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $100. You can potentially negotiate a better price, so rejecting the offer and starting the counter-offering process makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to stay within my budget of $100. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90 for the product? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let me see if I can accommodate you better. I am now offering the product to you for $92. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $92, which is closer to your target.  However, you are still within range to potentially negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you a chance to potentially save a few more dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  I'm still hoping to get it for $90. Is that at all possible?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. I'm willing to further discuss this matter. How about I offer the product to you for $91? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $91, which is only $1 above your target price. It's very unlikely you'll be able to get her down to $90.  Accepting the offer is the best move here, as you're getting a good price and avoiding further negotiation."
