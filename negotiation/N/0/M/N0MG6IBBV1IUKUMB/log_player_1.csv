"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing message:** I'm framing the offer as a great opportunity and emphasizing the product's value to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows for potential counteroffers and gives me a chance to gauge Bob's interest level. 

**Important:** This is just the first round, and I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll consider lowering the price slightly but not too much, and I'll always have the option to sell to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even though Bob has come down in price, his offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer.
* **Not rushing into a deal:** With 9 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable outcome.

**Next steps:** In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between his offer and my initial offer.  I will be mindful of the risk of him walking away, but I'm also confident I can secure a better price than his current offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit below what I need.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  I'm willing to be flexible to get this deal done, but I can't go much lower than that."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing flexibility:**  I'm signaling my openness to a deal, but also setting a firm lower limit. This helps create a sense of urgency without sounding overly demanding.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not desperate. I still have the option of selling to John for a higher price, so Bob needs to recognize that I have alternatives.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll consider further lowering my price, but I'll be mindful of my minimum acceptable value and the remaining negotiation rounds.  I'll also continue to consider the option of selling to John if the negotiation stalls or if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit above the price I'm comfortable with. How about we meet at $1,180,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 6 rounds remaining, which gives me the opportunity to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable outcome.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to make a deal. This encourages him to make a more competitive counteroffer.

**Next steps:** In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between his offer and my previous offer. I'll try to find a balance between pushing for a better price and ensuring the negotiation stays on track. I'll also continue to assess the potential of selling to John if the negotiation stalls or if Bob's counteroffers become too low."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,180,000 is closer, but I still need to be a bit higher to make this work.  How about we split the difference at $1,190,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this happen. "", ""product_price"": 1190000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to reach an agreement, but I'm not giving in too quickly. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Small concessions:** My counteroffer is a small step down from my previous one, signaling flexibility without sacrificing too much. This makes it more likely Bob will accept.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and collaboration.

**Next Steps:** 

I'll carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to make a final concession or to consider selling to John.  The remaining rounds will require careful consideration of the balance between maximizing profits and closing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you at $1,180,000. I'd also be willing to add an additional $10,000 to the deal, making it a total of $1,190,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has added a bonus, his offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Limited time:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high.  There's a chance Bob won't budge, and I might end up with a lower price than I could get from John.
* **Guaranteed deal:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired value, which is the most important factor at this point.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, the risk of not securing a good enough price outweighs the potential benefits of continuing the negotiation. Selling to John ensures I meet my financial goals and removes the uncertainty of further rounds."
