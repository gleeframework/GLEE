"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $10,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a discount. I believe it's a great deal considering the immense value this product can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $12,000, making it a very good deal. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price. Accepting the offer saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John."
