"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $13,500. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,250?",12250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $12,250. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $12,625?",12625.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $12,625. I can do $13,250, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Your 'final offer' is barely moving.  I'll offer you $12,750, but that's absolutely it.  If you don't accept, I'm going with John.",12750.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're feeling frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on this deal yet. I can do $13,000, but that's really as low as I can go. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product.",13000.0,Alice,9,
