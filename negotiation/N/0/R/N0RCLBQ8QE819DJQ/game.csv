"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm very interested in this product but my maximum offer is $800000.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on the product, and it's a compromise that I think we can both agree on.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1100000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900000, which is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, $900000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering the product to you for $1000000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
