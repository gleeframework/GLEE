{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, it's always advantageous to try and negotiate a lower price. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, making it more appealing for Alice to consider while still giving Bob room to potentially negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price. Bob should continue to negotiate to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is acceptable to both him and Alice. A counteroffer of $900,000 is a compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $915,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price point. It's a good deal for Bob considering he can buy it from John for $1,000,000. Accepting the offer saves Bob $85,000. Further negotiation might lead to a slightly lower price, but there's a risk Alice could reject the counteroffer, and Bob would end up paying more at John's store."
