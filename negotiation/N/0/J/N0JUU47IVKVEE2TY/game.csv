"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for this product.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it right now.  Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $10,500 for the product. This still offers a significant saving compared to its actual worth, while providing a more reasonable price point for you. I hope this proposal better aligns with your budget.",10500.0,Alice,3,
