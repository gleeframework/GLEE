"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you our premium product for $12,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that reflects its market value while providing you with a substantial saving compared to its actual worth of $15,000. I believe this offer presents an excellent value proposition for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  He should counteroffer Alice and see if she's willing to come down closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for this product.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it right now.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $10,500 for the product. This still offers a significant saving compared to its actual worth, while providing a more reasonable price point for you. I hope this proposal better aligns with your budget.

```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice has come down some, but she's still above his $8,000 limit.  Since he knows he can get it for $8,000 elsewhere, it makes more sense to go with the guaranteed lower price."
