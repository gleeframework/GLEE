Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly higher than John's offer, giving Bob a potential benefit.
* **There's no guarantee Bob will accept.** It's a risk, but the goal is to maximize profit.  
* **We're not assuming anything about Bob's value.** This offer is based on the potential for a higher sale, not on any information about Bob's perceived worth.

**If Bob rejects:**

* We'll sell to John for $1,000,000, still a good outcome.

**If Bob accepts:**

* We'll earn $500,000 more than our baseline. 

This strategy balances potential profit with the need to sell the product if Bob isn't interested."
