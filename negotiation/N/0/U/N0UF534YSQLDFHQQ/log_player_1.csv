Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit. I'll reject his offer and counter once more."
