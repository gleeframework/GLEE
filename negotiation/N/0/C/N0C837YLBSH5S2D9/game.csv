"Alice, I appreciate you reaching out, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my research and the market value of similar products, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this one. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $2,300,000 represents what I believe to be its full potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to facilitate a deal. This feels like a fair compromise, what do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,100,000, which I believe reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be frank, $1,100,000 is cutting it close to my baseline, but I'm motivated to make a deal happen. My final offer is $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. Let me know if this works for you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
