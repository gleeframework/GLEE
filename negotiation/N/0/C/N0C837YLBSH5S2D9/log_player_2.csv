"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is way too high. You should reject it and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $2,300,000 represents what I believe to be its full potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to facilitate a deal. This feels like a fair compromise, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,900,000 is still well above your budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be frank, $1,100,000 is cutting it close to my baseline, but I'm motivated to make a deal happen. My final offer is $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above your budget. At this point, it's best to secure the product from John for $800,000. While you might be able to negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee you'll reach a price you're comfortable with. It's more prudent to take the guaranteed deal from John."
