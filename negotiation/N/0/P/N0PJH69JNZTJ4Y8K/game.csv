"Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $950,000. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is your maximum offer, but I'm still hoping we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
