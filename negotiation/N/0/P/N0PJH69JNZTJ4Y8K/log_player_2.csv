"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate with Alice and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is your maximum offer, but I'm still hoping we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than what he can get from John.  It's unlikely that he'll be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, so it's in his best interest to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
