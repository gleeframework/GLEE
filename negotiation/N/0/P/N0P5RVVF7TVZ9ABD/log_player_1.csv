Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
