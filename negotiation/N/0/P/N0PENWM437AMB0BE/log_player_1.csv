""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefit it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from the sale.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000 provides leverage. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation downward while still remaining significantly above your minimum acceptable price.
* **John as a Backup:** The guaranteed sale to John for $800,000 provides a safety net.

By starting high but below Bob's maximum valuation, this offer aims to secure the best possible outcome for Alice."
