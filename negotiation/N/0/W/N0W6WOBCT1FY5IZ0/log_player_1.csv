"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $120 to me and $80 to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to try to get closer to my price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $100. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between his last offer and my previous offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept, as it's still a good deal for him and allows me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $92. While it's still slightly below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum, and I'm worried that continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or me needing to sell to John for $120. It's better to secure a profit now than risk losing out on a sale."
