Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000). 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point.  Depending on your negotiation style and knowledge about Bob, you might adjust the initial offer."
