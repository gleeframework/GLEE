"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefit you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $1,100,000, while John wants $1,200,000. 
* **You're still within your budget:**  The $1,100,000 price is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
