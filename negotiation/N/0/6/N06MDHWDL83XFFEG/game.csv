"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,150,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm still open to negotiation. Let's make this happen!",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,225,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,225,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,237,500? I'm confident this price is fair to both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. What do you say?",1237500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
