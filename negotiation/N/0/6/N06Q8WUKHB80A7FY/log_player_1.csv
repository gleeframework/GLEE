"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $135?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $135 is the best price for this product. I'd be willing to pay $125, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While I could push for more, Bob seems firm on his limit, and $125 is a reasonable profit above my minimum. It's better to secure a deal now than risk him backing out entirely."
