"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's initial offer is above your budget. It's time to negotiate and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. Unfortunately, that's a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer ($80) gives you room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below your $100 maximum budget. It also gauges Alice's willingness to move from her initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice came down slightly, but it's still above your budget. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $90?  That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're increasing our offer to show willingness to negotiate, but still staying below our $100 limit.  This keeps us in the game and puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she's willing to accept a lower profit margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $90. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I can offer it to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but we're still over budget.  Let's see if we can push her just a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work.  I can do $95 as my final offer.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer is strategically placed just above John's price. This accomplishes a few things:

* **Signals seriousness:**  It shows Alice we're serious about buying but also nearing our limit.
* **Maintains pressure:** It keeps the negotiation moving without conceding too much.
* **Provides a win-win:**  Alice still makes a profit, and we save a small amount compared to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your last offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $105. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a fair price, so I'll make one more counteroffer to meet you in the middle at $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has finally met our price match with John's offer. There's no point in negotiating further or risking losing the deal. Accepting now secures the product at our target price."
