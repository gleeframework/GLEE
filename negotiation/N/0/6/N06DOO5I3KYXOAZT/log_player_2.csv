"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice first. $130 is still quite a bit more than I want to spend."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point to see how Alice reacts. It's a low price, but it leaves room for negotiation and keeps us well below our $80 budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $100 is still too high. We'll try negotiating a bit more, but we're getting closer to the point where John's offer might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the value, Alice, but I have a strict budget. How about $75? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Increases the offer:**  Showing Alice we're willing to move towards a compromise.
* **Stays within budget:**  Keeps us under our $80 limit.
* **Firm but polite:**  The ""final offer"" adds some pressure, but we maintain a friendly tone.

Now it's up to Alice. If she accepts, we get a good deal. If not, we'll likely go with John's offer to avoid exceeding our budget."
