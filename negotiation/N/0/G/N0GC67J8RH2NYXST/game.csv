"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  $8,500 is the lowest I can go, given the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $8,500. Would you consider $7,750? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not able to go that low. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $8,250 is my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $8,150. It's still a bit above my target price, but I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. What do you think?",8150.0,Bob,6,
