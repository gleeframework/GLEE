Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price.** This allows for negotiation space. 
* **The message is friendly and persuasive.** It highlights the value of the product without revealing my true minimum. 

This strategy aims to get Bob engaged in negotiation while still protecting my interests. I'm confident I can get a higher price than Bob's initial assessment, but I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. It's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  Even though it's higher than his initial assessment, it's still not a good deal for me.
* **I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.** I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price range, but still leaves room for further negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I want to maximize my earnings. Continuing negotiations with Bob gives me a chance to potentially get a higher price than $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints.  However, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation.**  I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range but still attractive to Bob.
* **The message is still friendly but emphasizes the value of the product.** I reiterate the value of the product without revealing my exact minimum. 
* **The message also suggests a compromise.**  This can be a good tactic to encourage Bob to agree to a higher price.

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer allows me to continue negotiating while still protecting my interests. It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer immediately, but it increases the chances of a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** Even though he's coming closer to my desired price, it's still not a good deal for me. 
* **I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.**  I'm confident that I can reach a more favorable price that's closer to my desired range.

**Reasoning:**

While selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is getting closer, it's still not quite there for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,750? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.**  I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range but still keeps the negotiation moving. 
* **The message is still friendly but emphasizes a compromise.**  This can be a good tactic to encourage Bob to agree to a higher price. 
* **The message also proposes a specific number.** This can help Bob to feel like he has some control over the negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move that allows me to continue negotiating while still protecting my interests. It's unlikely that Bob will accept this offer immediately, but it increases the chances of a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but I'm not sure I can stretch further. Can you consider meeting me at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  He has made it clear he won't go higher, and continuing to negotiate will likely just lead to more time wasted without a better outcome. 
* **Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a certain profit.**  This is a safe and reliable option, and it's time to move on from this negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer to get a higher price, it's not worth risking another round of negotiation with Bob only to potentially get a lower offer or reach a stalemate. Selling to John ensures a stable income, and I can always look for better deals in the future."
