"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. It's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints.  However, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is getting closer, it's still not quite there for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,750? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but I'm not sure I can stretch further. Can you consider meeting me at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
