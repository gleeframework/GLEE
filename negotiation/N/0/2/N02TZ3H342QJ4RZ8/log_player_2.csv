"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is your maximum, it's always worth trying to negotiate. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price, and even if she doesn't, you haven't lost anything by rejecting the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $70 is a reasonable first step. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation if Alice needs to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  While you could try to push for a lower price, there's a chance Alice might dig in her heels, and you risk wasting rounds. Accepting her offer at $75 gets you the product for a reasonable price and saves time for further negotiation."
