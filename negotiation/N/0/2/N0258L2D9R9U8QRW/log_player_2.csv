"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal for something of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. Rejecting Alice's offer might make her propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $8,000. You can always fall back on buying from John for $12,000 if needed."
