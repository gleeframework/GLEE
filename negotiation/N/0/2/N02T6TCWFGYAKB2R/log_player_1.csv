Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,850,000?"", ""product_price"": 1850000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,850,000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it benefits both of us.

You have three options:

Bob is not budging from his $1,200,000 offer, and further negotiation is unlikely to close the gap. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
