"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've indicated, and it allows us both to benefit from the transaction. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a fair price for you, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  This represents a good compromise for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $900,000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far apart from that number. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering you a price of $1,050,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a 5-year warranty and a dedicated support package. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
