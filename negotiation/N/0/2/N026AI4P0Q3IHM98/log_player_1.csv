Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've indicated, and it allows us both to benefit from the transaction.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
