"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'd need to see a lower price to make it work.  How about $10,000? ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 was a bit steep, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'll get from the product. ",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and it's a compromise between our previous discussions. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
