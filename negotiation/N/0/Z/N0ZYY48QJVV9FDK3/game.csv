"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $10000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12500.  This represents a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit off.  How about $11500?  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen.",11500.0,Alice,5,
