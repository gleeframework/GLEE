"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the deal, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $130? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit over my budget at $130. I'm really keen on this product, but $110 is the absolute most I can do. Let's see if we can close the deal at that price.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is your absolute maximum, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
