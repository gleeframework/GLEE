Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that. Let's compromise. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. This still leaves a significant profit for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's value.  I'm ready to close the deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

Alice has come down to her lowest price, which is still a good deal for you. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal."
