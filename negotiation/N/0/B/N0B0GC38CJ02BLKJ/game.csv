"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe it's a bit high, considering I've seen similar products on the market for less. Can you consider my offer?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique features and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10500. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9500? I think that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",9500.0,Bob,4,

I can offer it to you for $10800. It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's unique features. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9200? I think that's the highest I can go, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if you can meet me at this price.",9200.0,Bob,6,
