""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I think a price of $130 is fair for both of us. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming high initially gives you room to negotiate down if needed.  A price of $130 allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal (saving $20) while you secure a $50 profit. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** This initial offer sets the stage for possible negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to adjust your price slightly while still staying above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $80 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
