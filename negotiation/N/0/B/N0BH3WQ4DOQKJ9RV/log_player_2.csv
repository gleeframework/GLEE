"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,400,000.  I think it's a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's better to see if we can get a lower price by counteroffering."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential for you.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,350,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
