"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential for you.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering your value and my financial limitations.  Let's find a middle ground here.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
