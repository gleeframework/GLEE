Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $150, our goal is to maximize profit.  Offering it to Bob first gives us a chance to potentially earn even more.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $140 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Appeal to Value:** The message frames the price as a ""special deal,"" subtly implying that it's a good offer for Bob.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $140.  We'll need to be prepared to potentially negotiate or accept John's offer if Bob rejects the initial price."
