"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. That's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
