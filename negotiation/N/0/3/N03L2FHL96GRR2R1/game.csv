"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business. Given its potential worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value in your product, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to consider purchasing it for $950,000. This price aligns more closely with my current financial capacity and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's immense potential and offers a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,050,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which represents a significant investment for me. This price reflects a fair compromise and provides us both with a successful transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
