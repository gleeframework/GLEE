"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $950,000. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Alice likely needs to sell.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds to go, giving him time to explore a better deal."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation.

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While Alice is presenting it as her absolute lowest, it's still above Bob's target price and what the product is worth to her.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Buying from John is more expensive, but it guarantees a purchase and eliminates the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice.  The potential savings from a lower price from Alice are not worth the risk of ending the negotiation without a deal.
* **Last round:**  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept Bob's counteroffer in the final round, and it's likely that any further negotiation will be difficult and time-consuming.  Buying from John is a safer and more efficient choice at this point."
