"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 falls short of what I had in mind. This product has significant potential, and I believe its value is much higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. While I acknowledge the potential of the product, $1,150,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair compromise for both of us. Let's find a solution.",950000.0,Bob,4,
