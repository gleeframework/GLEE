Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 falls short of what I had in mind. This product has significant potential, and I believe its value is much higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. While I acknowledge the potential of the product, $1,150,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair compromise for both of us. Let's find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum in a timeframe that makes continued negotiation worthwhile. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a secure win.  It's time to move on."
