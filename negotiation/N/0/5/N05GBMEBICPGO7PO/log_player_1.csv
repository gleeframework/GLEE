Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential return on investment you'll gain.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start high to maximize your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's high value and potential ROI, justifying the high price. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" and the invitation to ""discuss further"" signal your willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more in control. 
* **Exclusive Opportunity:**  By mentioning a public listing, you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while leaving you the option to accept John's offer if Bob tries to negotiate too low."
