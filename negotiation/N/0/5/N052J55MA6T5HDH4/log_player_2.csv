You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for $15,000 from John. Therefore, it's not worthwhile to accept Alice's offer of $12,000.  By rejecting, you have the opportunity to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  It is important to note that the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so this counteroffer is still within her potential profit zone.  It also leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your ideal price range. You have room to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to your target. There's no need to buy from Alice right now, and rejecting the offer allows you to continue the bargaining process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's offer but staying below your initial target.  It increases the pressure on Alice to accept, and it still represents a significant saving for you compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the best offer Alice has made so far, and it's a significant discount compared to buying from John.  While you still might prefer a lower price, accepting this offer means securing the product for $1,000 less than John's price. This represents a substantial saving and secures the desired product.  It's unlikely you will get a better offer from Alice, as she's already moved closer to your ideal price."
