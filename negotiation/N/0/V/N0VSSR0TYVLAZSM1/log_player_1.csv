Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm framing the offer as fair, which could make Bob more inclined to accept.
* **Openness:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. 
* Throughout the negotiation, I'll keep John's offer of $1,200,000 in mind as my ""walk away"" price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Low:**  Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as my ""walk away"" price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I might suggest a price of $1,150,000, explaining that it's a fair compromise and still allows for a reasonable profit for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This still leaves room for you to profit from the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a midpoint between my initial offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($1,050,000). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Profitability:** I'm emphasizing that the price still allows Bob to make a profit, making the offer more appealing.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a clear reason for my counteroffer, highlighting its fairness.
* **Openness:** I'm again inviting Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll happily close the deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a final counteroffer before selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. Based on our previous negotiations, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is exactly my initial offer and represents a good compromise. 
* **Close to Minimum:** While it's not my ideal price, it's close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  There's always the risk that Bob might reject my next counteroffer, or that I might not be able to get a better price from him in future rounds.  Accepting his offer minimizes this risk and guarantees a sale.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and move forward with the sale."
