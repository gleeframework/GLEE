"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $10,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire an item valued at $12,000 to you at a competitive price. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than what you'd pay John, you can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and counteroffering. You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation to find a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. I am willing to sell the product for $9,500. This price reflects the value of the product while also considering your budget. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good deal for me. It's still lower than what I'd pay John ($12,000) and is closer to my initial counteroffer of $9,000. Accepting this offer allows me to save money and get the product."
