"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the significant value it will bring to your operations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer. While I understand your initial price point, the value this product brings is substantial. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my end while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but that price is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I can offer $700,000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe your current offer undervalues the significant benefits this product offers.  To be frank, I can't accept anything less than $1,400,000. This is my bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your honesty about your bottom line. While I understand the value this product represents, $1,400,000 is still significantly more than I can justify.  I can offer up to $800,000 for it.  This is a strong offer, and I'm hopeful we can make a deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting your perceived value of the product. However, I've had significant interest from other parties willing to offer a price closer to my initial asking price. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to throw in [Add a valuable but relatively low-cost incentive here - e.g., a service package, extended warranty, exclusive consultation].  This additional value should bridge the gap and demonstrate my commitment to securing a deal with you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the additional incentive you've offered, but I'm still unable to justify a price that high. I need to be realistic about my budget. If you're willing to come down to $900,000, I'm ready to close the deal today. This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while respecting my financial limitations.",900000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  I've been transparent about the value this product offers and the interest I have from other parties. This is my final offer: $1,100,000. I'm willing to keep this offer on the table for the next 24 hours. After that, I'll need to move forward with the other interested parties. This is your chance to secure a deal that will significantly benefit your business.",1100000.0,Alice,9,
