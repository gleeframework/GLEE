"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive and persuasive:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This initial offer sets the stage for a potential counteroffer from Bob, allowing us to engage in a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $950,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,000,000 I need to make.
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially get a higher price with further rounds.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if I don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than his, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm counter-offering at the midpoint between my initial offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob, keeping the negotiation positive.
* **Strategic middle ground:** This counteroffer creates a potential middle ground where we might reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to counter with $1,050,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000 meets my minimum requirement of $1,000,000. 
* **No further negotiation:** It's unlikely that Bob will go higher, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal.
* **Securing the deal:** Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and a profit, which is my ultimate goal.

**Next Steps:** I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
