"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. Is that something you'd be interested in?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high.  I'm happy to pay $100.  That's my absolute max, and it would make this a great deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to compromise at $105. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this great product.",105.0,Alice,5,
