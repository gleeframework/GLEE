{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer will help him save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is clearly not willing to go much lower than $9,400. Bob has already made two counteroffers, and it's likely Alice is holding firm at her price. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget, even if it's not the absolute best deal. Continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to a lower price, but it risks losing the product entirely if Alice refuses to budge further."
