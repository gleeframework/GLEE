# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $110, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $110 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  Since your goal is to save money and you're indifferent between sellers, buying from John is the most financially sound decision."
