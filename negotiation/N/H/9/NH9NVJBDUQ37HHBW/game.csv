"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can make this deal work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the market value of similar products. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on. Let's close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $875,000 is still a bit above your target price. However, I'm not willing to go below $900,000, as that would be below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $912,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on. Let's work together to close this deal.",912500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement.  However, $912,500 is still slightly above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to offer $890,000 for the product. This is a strong offer that's fair to both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $890,000 is a strong offer, but I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $897,500. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product and the market value of similar products. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",897500.0,Alice,7,
