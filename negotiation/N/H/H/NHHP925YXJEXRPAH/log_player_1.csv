Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $14,000 is too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $5,000 for it.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to let it go for $10,500."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit. How about $7,500? That's a fair offer considering we're both compromising. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but he's still far below the $10,000 John is offering.  It's unlikely Bob will reach a price that's beneficial for Alice in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees Alice her minimum desired price."
