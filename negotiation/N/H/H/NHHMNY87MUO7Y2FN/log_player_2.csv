"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your endeavors. Given its exceptional value and quality, I am confident it will be a valuable asset to you. Considering its worth to both of us, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for $12,000. This price reflects its true value while allowing for a fair transaction between us. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John**, as $12,000 is less than $15,000. 
* **However, you can likely get a better price.** You are willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice values the product at $10,000. There's room for negotiation to get a lower price. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a better price with Alice.**  This is a strategic move to potentially save more money."
