"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, but $120 is still a significant markup from your target price. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation.** You can try to get a lower price from Alice. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  It's only worth it if you can't get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is a reasonable starting point.**  It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on your target price.**  $100 is closer to your desired value for the product. 
* **Remaining flexible.**  You're willing to go higher if needed, but this counteroffer shows you're serious about getting a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is now closer to your target price.** While $110 is still more than you'd ideally pay, it's only $10 above your initial counteroffer.
* **Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal.** Alice might be unwilling to go lower, and you're already in round 3, meaning you're halfway through your negotiation rounds.
* **Accepting the offer is a good compromise.**  It allows you to secure the product at a decent price, avoiding the higher cost of buying from John."
