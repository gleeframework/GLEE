"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $120?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $60 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $90? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $90.  I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's make a deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit to $95. It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on that.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, but $95 is still a bit below what I need to make this work.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",102.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer, take it or leave it.  I can go up to $98, but that's really the absolute limit for me.",98.0,Bob,8,
