"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for a product of this value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you at $750,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you be open to considering $725,000?"", ""product_price"": 725000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet at least $775,000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very firm on her price and unlikely to go below $775,000.  John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000. It makes more financial sense to buy from John at this point and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
