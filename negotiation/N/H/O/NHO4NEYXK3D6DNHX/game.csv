"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,150,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement with you, the  $1,050,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  This is my final offer.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice. However, based on my current financial situation, I cannot agree to the proposed price of $1,125,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I hope this offer is within your acceptable range and we can move forward with the transaction.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
