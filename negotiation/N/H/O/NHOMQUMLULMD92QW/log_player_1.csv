Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $140.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, but still ensures a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While you could start higher, it might make Bob less willing to negotiate or even consider the offer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John provides a safety net.  This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
