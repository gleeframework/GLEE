I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I can get more from him or sell to John for $80.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let me make one last offer. I am willing to pay $87 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's better than selling to John for $80.  It's also likely Bob won't budge any further."
