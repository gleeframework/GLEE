"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a deal at $105. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I'm starting to think I might have to look elsewhere if we can't meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $98. Can you meet me there?",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $98, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you a deal at $102. It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a good value for the product.",102.0,Alice,7,
