"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth more than $150 to us. Considering its high quality and unique features, I think it would be valuable to you as well. Given its worth to us, I propose to sell it to you for $120. This is a special offer considering its true value and I believe it's a fair deal. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $120 is lower than her stated value, it's still significantly higher than your $80 maximum and the guaranteed $80 price from John. You can do better by rejecting this offer."
