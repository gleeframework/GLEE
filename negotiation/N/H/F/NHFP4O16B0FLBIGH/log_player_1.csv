Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could net you a little extra profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $149 is just below your guaranteed price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This makes it more likely he'll see it as a bargain.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, this price point leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob attempts to negotiate further."
