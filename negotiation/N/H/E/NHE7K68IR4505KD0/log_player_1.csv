"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit for myself. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$80 is far too low for me.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to offer Bob my minimum price of $120. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still being competitive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $90 is closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price from Bob. It's too early to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $110. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it.  I'm starting to feel the pressure with the limited rounds, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  John is still an option, but I have a few more rounds to try with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $105.  We're getting close to a potential deal. I'm hoping Bob will accept this counteroffer.  If he rejects, I may need to seriously consider selling to John."
