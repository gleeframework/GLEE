"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something a little lower. Could you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
