"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $150 is the maximum value he places on the product.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee I can get him higher, and I risk him walking away. John offers a guaranteed $150, which meets my minimum acceptable price. It makes more sense to take the sure sale with John at this point."
