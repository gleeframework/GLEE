Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer of $9,000. While it's tempting to sell now, I believe I can get closer to my minimum price of $12,000.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to move closer to $10,500."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I believe you'll find this product is worth every penny. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
