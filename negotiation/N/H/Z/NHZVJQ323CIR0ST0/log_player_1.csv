Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting high ($1,350,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of his own valuation. 
* **""Fair offer"" framing:**  This positions the price as reasonable, not an attempt to take advantage of his higher valuation.
* **Open for negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, implying willingness to discuss further if Bob hesitates.

**Why not go higher?**

While Bob's valuation is $1,500,000, an excessively high offer might:

* **Offend him:**  He could see it as greedy and walk away.
* **Leave no room for him to ""win"":** A successful negotiation usually makes both parties feel they got a decent deal. 

This strategy balances ambition with the need to secure the sale over the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
