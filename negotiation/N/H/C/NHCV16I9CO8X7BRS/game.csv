"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 might be a bit high, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $105 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $100?  I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $100 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $102.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",102.5,Alice,5,
