Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more than it is to me.  I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,350,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects its significant worth."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 allows for some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Strong Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and positions the offer as a win-win.

By taking this approach, Alice increases her chances of securing a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than her backup offer from John."
