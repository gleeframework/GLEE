"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $950000. This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still leaving room for you to make a profit.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975000.  This offer represents a fair middle ground and allows us both to make a mutually beneficial deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to come down,  $1025000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
