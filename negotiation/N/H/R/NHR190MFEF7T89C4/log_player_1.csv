Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130.  It's a great deal and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point above your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also frames the offer as a good deal for Bob, making him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is more than your minimum, it's still lower than your initial offer, and there's potential to get closer to your desired price.  Rejecting this counteroffer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $120 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is a good compromise. It's a fair price for both parties, and it's higher than what you could get from John.  It's important to consider that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate, making this offer the best option to maximize profit."
