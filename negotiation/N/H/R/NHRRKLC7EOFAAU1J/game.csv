,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850000. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs.",875000.0,Alice,5,
