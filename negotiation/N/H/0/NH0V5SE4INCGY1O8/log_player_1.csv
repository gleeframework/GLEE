I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This gives me a potential profit of $3,000 over my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $12,000, which is my guaranteed minimum.  This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while still having a fallback option."
