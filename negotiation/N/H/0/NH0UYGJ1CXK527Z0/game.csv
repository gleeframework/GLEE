"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I understand it holds similar value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset. Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
