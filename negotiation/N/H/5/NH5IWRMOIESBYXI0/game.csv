"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my goal. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000 for it. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to be closer to $9,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $8,500. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. How about we settle at $7,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,750 is still a bit below where I need to be. To make this work, I'm willing to drop to $8,250. That's a significant compromise on my end, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,
