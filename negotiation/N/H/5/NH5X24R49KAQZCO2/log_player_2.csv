"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You can get the product for less than $1,200,000 from John, so you should try to negotiate with Alice.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Alice's offer is significantly higher than the product's value to her ($800,000).  This indicates she has room to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you a good profit while still saving me money compared to John's offer."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This still gives you a significant savings over John's offer and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to your desired price.** Her counteroffer of $1,050,000 is significantly lower than her initial offer of $1,100,000.
* **The price is acceptable.** You're still saving money compared to buying from John ($1,200,000), making this a good deal.
* **Further negotiation might not be worthwhile.**  While you could try to push for a lower price, the risk is that Alice might walk away and you'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
