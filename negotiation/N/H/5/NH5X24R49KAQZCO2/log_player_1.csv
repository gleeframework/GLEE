{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,100,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a $100,000 gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential counteroffers.
* **It shows good faith:** You're not starting with an extremely high price, indicating you're open to a deal. 

Keep in mind that you can adjust this offer based on Bob's response and your own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is a bit steep for me. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to pay $950000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you a good profit while still saving me money compared to John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and your desired profit margin. You have room to negotiate a better deal with Bob, so rejecting his offer is the best strategy for maximizing your potential earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still gives you a significant savings over John's offer and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
