"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is a bit steep for me. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to pay $950000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you a good profit while still saving me money compared to John's offer.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This still gives you a significant savings over John's offer and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
