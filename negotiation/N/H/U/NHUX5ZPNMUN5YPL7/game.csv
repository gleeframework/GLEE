"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to be closer to your asking price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
