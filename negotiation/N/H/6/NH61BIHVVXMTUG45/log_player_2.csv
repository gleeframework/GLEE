"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $80 to you, accepting Alice's offer won't save you any money. You can get the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps your options open for potentially finding a better deal later."
