Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,340,000 is still below what I need. Let's try $1,380,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down considerably, and the price of $1,380,000 is a good deal compared to John's fixed price of $1,500,000.  Continuing to negotiate might result in Alice pulling back or the difference becoming negligible. It's best to secure the savings now."
