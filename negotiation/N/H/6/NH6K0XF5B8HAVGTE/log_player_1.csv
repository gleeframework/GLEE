Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is closer to my minimum value of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive messaging:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. This helps to establish a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Keeping John in mind:** While I'm negotiating with Bob, I'm also aware that I have a backup option with John. This means I'm not under immense pressure to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd be willing to pay $13,500 for the product. It's still a great deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not ideal:** While $13,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my ideal price point.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John's offer is the safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides me with a buffer, allowing me to take a risk and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $14,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of reason and making the offer more attractive.
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message maintains a friendly tone and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $14,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $13,800 for the product. It's getting close to my target, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing Bob and ending up with John's $15,000 offer is too high.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time, and with John as an option, I don't want to risk losing a sale entirely. 

This offer represents a good compromise, and I'm confident that I can find a way to make up the difference elsewhere."
