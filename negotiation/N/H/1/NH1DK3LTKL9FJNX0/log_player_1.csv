{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:**  This price is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer, highlighting the potential value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a slightly lower price, I hope to encourage Bob to accept the offer. However, if he rejects it, I have room to negotiate further and eventually either reach a mutually acceptable price or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save as much as possible. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below my initial offer of $14,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows that he's interested in the product and willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to walk away if necessary. This will put pressure on Bob to increase his offer in the next round. I will then counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500. This shows a willingness to compromise while still ensuring a decent profit for myself.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the fairness of the offer, highlighting the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement. It also invites Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer that's closer to my initial offer, I hope to encourage Bob to accept. This strategy aims to reach a mutually acceptable price while avoiding a stalemate or a need to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $13,000? It's the best I can do, and I'm willing to compromise to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum.**  $13,000 is only $2,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited.**  We've already gone through a few rounds, and further negotiation might be time-consuming and unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome.

**Strategy:**

While $13,000 is not ideal, it's a reasonable price considering the back and forth we've had. Accepting his offer allows me to sell the product quickly and avoid the risk of Bob walking away completely or potentially lowering his offer further."
