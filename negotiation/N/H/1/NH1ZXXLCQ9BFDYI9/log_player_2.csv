"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,500. It's a decent price compared to John's offer, and continuing to haggle has a risk of losing the deal altogether."
