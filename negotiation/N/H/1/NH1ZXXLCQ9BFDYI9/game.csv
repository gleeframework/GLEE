"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $12,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
