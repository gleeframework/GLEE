"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good price, it's still above your desired maximum of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price from Alice before resorting to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe this reflects the product's value fairly.
