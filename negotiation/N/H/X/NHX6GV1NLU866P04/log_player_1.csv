"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $100? I'm really interested in this product and think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not willing to sell for $100, as that's my minimum. I'll try to get a better price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference at $125? That way, we both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer of $110. It's still above my minimum, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price from Bob. It's also a good deal since I can sell to John for $100."
