"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $100? I'm really interested in this product and think it's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference at $125? That way, we both walk away happy.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
