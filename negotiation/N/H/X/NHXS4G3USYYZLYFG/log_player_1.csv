{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's above my minimum value of $12,000, but leaves room for negotiation and still gives Bob a good deal since the product is worth $15,000 to him. 
* This offer is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting his offer would result in a loss for me. It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  Selling to John for $12,000 is a safe option, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000** is a compromise between my minimum price of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $11,000. 
* I'm still making a profit, and it shows Bob I'm open to negotiation. 
* The message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, making it more likely he'll accept this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is above my minimum price of $12,000, making it a profitable deal for me. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that he'll walk away or that I might not be able to secure a better price.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and allows me to move on."
