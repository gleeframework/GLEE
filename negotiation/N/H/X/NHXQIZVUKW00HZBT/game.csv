"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking for a price closer to $80. Could we possibly meet in the middle?",95.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $95 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $135? This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $110 is still too low for me.  How about we meet at $125? That's a reasonable compromise, and it will allow me to make a fair profit.",125.0,Alice,5,
