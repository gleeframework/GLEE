"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $13,500 is getting closer, but I can't go that low.  Would you be willing to do $14,250?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
