Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offers in very small increments. It's unlikely he will reach a price that's significantly closer to your $1,200,000 minimum within the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer would result in a significant loss compared to selling to John.  

It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
