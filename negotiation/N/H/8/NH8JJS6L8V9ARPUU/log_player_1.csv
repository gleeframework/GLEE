Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $12,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $15,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $13,500? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, but $13,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $14,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $14,250? It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,250. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to try to get closer to my target of $13,500. How about we meet at $14,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $14,000 isn't my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum, and I'm concerned that if I reject it, Bob might walk away entirely. I'm confident that I can still make a decent profit, and it's better to secure the sale than risk losing the deal."
