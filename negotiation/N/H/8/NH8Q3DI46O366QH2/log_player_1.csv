"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still attractive to Bob since it's significantly lower than the value he places on the product. This allows for room for negotiation without immediately alienating him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better deal from Bob.  I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. I'm trying to find a middle ground that both Bob and I can agree on."
