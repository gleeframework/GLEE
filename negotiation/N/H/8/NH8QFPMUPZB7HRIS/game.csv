"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $2000000 is significantly more than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget and the potential benefits of this product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's potential benefits.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still above my budget.  To make this work, I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I truly believe this represents a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1200000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1300000. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident that it's still a great value for the product's potential benefits.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. While I understand the value you place on the product, $1300000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1100000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the potential benefits of the product while staying within my financial limitations.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1250000. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident that it's still a great value for the product's potential benefits. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
