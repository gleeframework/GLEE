"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's lower than my initial price, I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, I can't go as low as $1,400,000. Let's compromise at $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
