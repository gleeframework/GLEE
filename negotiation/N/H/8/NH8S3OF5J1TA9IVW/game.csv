"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. It's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to negotiate. Can we meet in the middle at $1700000?",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid I can't accept $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we try $1750000? It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about $1725000?",1725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1800000. I'm willing to give you a small concession, though. How about we try $1780000? It's the highest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",1780000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1725000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",1725000.0,Bob,6,
