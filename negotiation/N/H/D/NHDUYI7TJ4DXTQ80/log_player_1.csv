{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob is interested. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so there's no risk in starting high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm confident I can get more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm lowering my price to $13,000, which is still above my minimum and might be more appealing to Bob. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and move us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can get closer to my target price with another counteroffer. I'm confident that I can get a better deal than selling to John right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $12,500.  This is only $500 above my minimum, and hopefully, Bob will see that it's a reasonable price for both of us.  It's a good compromise and I'm optimistic that Bob will accept."
