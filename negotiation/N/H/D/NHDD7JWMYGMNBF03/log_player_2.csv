Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to make this sale work.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to drop my price to $9,000.  This would still allow you to get a good deal and me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?
