"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to make this sale work.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to drop my price to $9,000.  This would still allow you to get a good deal and me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $7,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a significant concession on my part.  This would give you a good deal, while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
