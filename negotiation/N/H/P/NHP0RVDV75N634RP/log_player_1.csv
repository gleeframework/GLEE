Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $14,500 is still a little steep for me. I could do $13,500 and I think that's a fair deal. What do you say?
