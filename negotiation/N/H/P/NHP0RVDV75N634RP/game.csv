"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Could you do $16,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you meet me in the middle at $13,000? ",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're getting closer!  How about we split the difference and call it $14,500? This product is really worth it, and I want to see it go to a good home.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $14,500 is still a little steep for me. I could do $13,500 and I think that's a fair deal. What do you say?",13500.0,Bob,6,
