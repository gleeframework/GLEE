"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $13000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $11500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $12250? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11750. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11750 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen.",12000.0,Alice,5,
