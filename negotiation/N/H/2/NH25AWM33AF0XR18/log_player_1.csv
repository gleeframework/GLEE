{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum, giving you room to negotiate. The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a bit steep for me, Alice. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is $80.  Would you be willing to come down to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. You need to try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're on a budget. $80 is unfortunately too low for me to consider.  How about we split the difference at $140?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you coming down on the price. $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $100, though.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your preferred price point. It's worth trying to push for a higher price, but if Bob stays firm at $100, selling to John for $150 is the better option."
