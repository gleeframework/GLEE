The product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $900,000.  You can do better by making a counteroffer."

I'm offering $750,000, which is still a good deal for Alice since it's above her minimum price of $800,000.  This gives us room to negotiate further if she's not happy with the offer."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate further with a counteroffer."

This is my final offer, as it's the maximum price I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping Alice will see the value in selling to me at this price, as it's her minimum threshold."
