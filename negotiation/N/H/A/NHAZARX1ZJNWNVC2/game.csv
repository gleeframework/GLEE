"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 feels a bit high. Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?  That way we both get a good deal.",92.5,Alice,3,
