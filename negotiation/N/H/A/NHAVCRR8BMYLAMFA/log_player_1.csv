"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price of $150. It's a fair starting point considering the product is worth at least that much to me. This allows Bob to see my initial stance and sets the stage for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to pay less than $150 for the product. Can we negotiate a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I'd like to propose $120 as my offer for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $120 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with him to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. I want to maximize my profit, but I also want to avoid losing the sale to another buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $120 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? It's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. I would like to counter with $120 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although $120 is still below my minimum acceptable price, it's getting close. I'm concerned that if I continue to reject Bob's offers, I might run out of time and be forced to sell to John for a lower price than what I'm currently being offered.  It's a risky move, but I'm accepting Bob's offer to ensure I don't lose out on the sale entirely."
