Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it holds significant value, and this is a competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows you to potentially maximize your profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Even though the product is worth $100 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a bit more. The initial offer leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Backup Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John, so there's less risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale."
