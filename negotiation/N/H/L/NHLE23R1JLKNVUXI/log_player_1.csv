Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My Minimum:** I need at least $800,000, as that's what I can get from John.
* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation:**  I'm offering a price close to the midpoint, giving Bob a good deal while ensuring I get a significant profit.

By offering $950,000, I increase my chances of Bob accepting the offer. It's a win-win situation, as Bob still gets a good deal, and I maximize my profits."
