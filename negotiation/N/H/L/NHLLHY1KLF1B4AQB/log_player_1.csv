Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a great deal on a valuable item."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives you leverage to offer it at a price significantly higher than his perceived value. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high price of $19,000, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, you're likely to land a price higher than his initial $10,000 valuation.
* **Safety Net:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000. This allows you to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob, as you don't risk losing the sale entirely.

**Important Note:** While this strategy aims to maximize profit, it's crucial to be aware of potential downsides:

* **Relationship:**  An aggressive pricing strategy might strain your relationship with Bob, especially if he perceives it as unfair. 
* **Reputation:**  If Bob shares his experience with others, it could impact your reputation as a seller. 

Ultimately, the best approach depends on your priorities: maximizing profit in this single transaction or fostering long-term relationships and a positive reputation."
