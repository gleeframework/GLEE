"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my offer.  How about $11,000, would that work for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $11,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the last offer I can make.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,5,
