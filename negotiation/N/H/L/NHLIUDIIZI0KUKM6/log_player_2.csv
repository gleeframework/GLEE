"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we've discussed, the product is worth $1000000 to you. I'm willing to make a fair offer and sell it to you for $1100000. I believe this is a great deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and allows for a good profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good deal for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1090000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum limit of $1,000,000.  Bob can likely negotiate further and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and increases the chances of getting a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,090,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not ready to give up on the price. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1080000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's maximum limit of $1,000,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a lower price, and Bob is better off securing the product from John for a guaranteed $1,000,000. This minimizes his risk and ensures he doesn't overpay."
