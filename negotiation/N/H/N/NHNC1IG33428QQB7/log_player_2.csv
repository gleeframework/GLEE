"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this excellent product. Given its features and value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $20,000 is way above his budget and he can get the product for $10,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your position, $20,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Could you consider meeting me halfway at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While $15,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. John is offering a price that fits his budget and there's no need to continue negotiating with Alice."
