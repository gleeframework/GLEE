"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1400000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1600000 to make this deal work.  This still leaves me some room, but it shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to make this work.  I can't go as low as $1350000, but I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is a significant concession on my part, and it's the final offer I can make.  Let me know if you're able to meet me at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
