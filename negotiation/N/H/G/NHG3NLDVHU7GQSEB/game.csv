"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a purchase price of $1100000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $1100000 doesn't quite reflect the product's full potential value.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This allows for a mutually beneficial deal while still recognizing the product's unique advantages. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us!",1200000.0,Alice,3,
