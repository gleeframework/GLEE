"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This offer takes into account the unique benefits this product offers and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,800,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,450,000.  This price reflects the product's value to me while remaining within my budget.  Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we are getting closer to an agreement. While I appreciate your latest offer,  $1,625,000 is still a bit high for my budget. To get this deal done, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,500,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and hopefully is within your range. Let's work together to close this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
