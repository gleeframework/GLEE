"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value establishes a strong initial position. This leaves room for negotiation and potential concessions while aiming for a final price well above your minimum. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" provides a reason for the high initial price without directly referencing specific features Bob may or may not find valuable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation process and share his perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is above his perceived value, indicating room for negotiation. While selling to John is a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's potential to secure a better deal with Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This offer takes into account the unique benefits this product offers and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from $2,000,000 to $1,800,000, showing flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Reiterating Value:**  We're reminding Bob of the product's value proposition without explicitly rejecting his offer, keeping the negotiation positive.
* **Middle Ground:**  This counter-offer attempts to establish a middle ground between our initial ask and Bob's offer, encouraging him to move closer to our desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,800,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,450,000.  This price reflects the product's value to me while remaining within my budget.  Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer significantly, which is a positive sign. However, he's still below our guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000). We're in a strong position to counter and push for a price closer to our desired range. With six rounds remaining, there's time for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we're getting closer. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,625,000.  This price reflects the product's true worth and acknowledges our mutual desire to close this deal. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1625000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:**  We're continuing to lower our asking price, now to $1,625,000, demonstrating our willingness to compromise.
* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  This offer sits almost directly between Bob's last offer ($1,450,000) and our previous ask ($1,800,000). 
* **Urgency and Agreement:**  Phrases like ""finding a middle ground"" and ""mutual desire to close"" subtly introduce a sense of urgency and shared goal, encouraging Bob to move closer to our target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are getting closer to an agreement. While I appreciate your latest offer,  $1,625,000 is still a bit high for my budget. To get this deal done, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,500,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and hopefully is within your range. Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met our guaranteed sale price with John.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the deal falling through. Accepting his offer now secures the best possible outcome in this scenario."
