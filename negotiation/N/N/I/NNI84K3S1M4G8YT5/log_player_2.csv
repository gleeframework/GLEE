"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product is $1,500,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my target price. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the effort I've put into acquiring the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still below Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject subsequent offers and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that saves him money compared to John."
