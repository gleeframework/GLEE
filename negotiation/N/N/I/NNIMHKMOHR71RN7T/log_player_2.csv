"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120, but Alice's offer is $100. There's room for negotiation to get a better price. 
* You can potentially save money by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $95. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $95 is still within your budget of $120.
*  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject your next counteroffer, and you'll end up paying $120 to John. 
* Accepting the offer at $95 is a good compromise and secures the product for you at a reasonable price."
