"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $750,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $925,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I'm looking to get for the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $925,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $850,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $950,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal for the product.",950000.0,Alice,5,
