"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a lower price.  It's also good to get a sense of how flexible Alice is in her pricing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the gesture, $1,400,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget for it is $1,250,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, but it's still above my ideal price.  I'm going to reject and see if I can get a lower price. I'm feeling confident that I can get closer to my target of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible. I'm still a little above my budget with $1,325,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,275,000?  I'm really keen on getting this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,275,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but she's still not within my budget.  While I could continue to negotiate, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a stalemate.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for my target price of $1,200,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids potentially losing more time and effort in negotiations with Alice."
