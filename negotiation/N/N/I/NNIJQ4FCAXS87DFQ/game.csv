"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the gesture, $1,400,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget for it is $1,250,000.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. I'm still a little above my budget with $1,325,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,275,000?  I'm really keen on getting this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,275,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
