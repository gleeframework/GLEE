"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more than my initial asking price.  To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for both of us.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm aiming for. To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $2,100,000.  This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my willingness to find common ground.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,800,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value it would bring to my business.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,800,000 is getting closer, but it's still a tough pill to swallow considering what this product is worth.  Let's settle this right now. How about $1,950,000? That's my final offer.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get the best price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,850,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value it would bring to my business. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to finalize a deal soon.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
