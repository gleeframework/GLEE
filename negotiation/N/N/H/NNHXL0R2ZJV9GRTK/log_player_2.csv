# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more than my initial asking price.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm aiming for. To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $2,100,000.  This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my willingness to find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,800,000 is getting closer, but it's still a tough pill to swallow considering what this product is worth.  Let's settle this right now. How about $1,950,000? That's my final offer.
