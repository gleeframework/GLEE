Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,050. I've gone as low as I can. I think we're getting close, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,050. How about we compromise at $8,525?

```

We're at the final round, and Bob's offer, while closer, still isn't acceptable. I'm running out of time and want to secure the best possible price. I'm choosing to sell to John for $10,000. This guarantees me a good profit and prevents me from potentially losing out on a sale altogether."
