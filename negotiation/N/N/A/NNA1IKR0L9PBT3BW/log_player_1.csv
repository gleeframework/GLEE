"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but still lower than my minimum acceptable value ($100). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that satisfies both of us.  I'm also being positive and encouraging a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $105? This is a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. This price is still within my acceptable range, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for Bob to accept. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product in my message to encourage him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $100 for the product. This is a great price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm emphasizing the win-win aspect for Bob by highlighting the ""great price"". If he rejects this, I'm comfortable selling to John for the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I've already reached my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that I can sell to John for the same amount, so I'm going to stop negotiating with Bob and sell to John."
