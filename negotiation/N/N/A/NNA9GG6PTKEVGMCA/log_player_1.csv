Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice needs to make at least $12,000 to match what John offers.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000. 
* **The Gap:**  There's a $2,000 difference between what Bob values the product for and Alice's minimum selling point.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice's best strategy is to offer the product to Bob at a price slightly below his maximum valuation. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while still maximizing Alice's profit. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,999. This is a fantastic deal, as I know it's something you're interested in. Let me know if you'd like to proceed!"", ""product_price"": 9999}
```

**Why This Works**

* **Undercuts Bob's Valuation:** By offering the product slightly below $10,000, Alice makes it very appealing for Bob to accept.
* **Creates Urgency:** The message implies this is a limited-time offer, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Maximizes Profit:** While Alice doesn't get the full $12,000, selling to Bob quickly for $9,999 is more profitable than potentially waiting longer and dealing with negotiations.

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice is confident John will definitely buy the product for $12,000. If there's any uncertainty about John's offer, Alice might need to adjust her strategy."
