"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1800000. This is a competitive price that I think reflects the product's value, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1800000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1200000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1350000.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I still think $1350000 is below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1550000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
