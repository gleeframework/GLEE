You have three options:

You can get the product for less than $9,000, so it makes sense to reject Alice's initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that you really want this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $9,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000.

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can do $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great price considering the product's value to you.

While I'd prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $9,000 is still significantly lower than what I'd pay from John. It's a good deal for me, so I'll accept it."
