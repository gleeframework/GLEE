**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the pace of the negotiation suggests it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly closer to your $1,200,000 walk-away point. You have a guaranteed offer from John, and the potential increase from continuing with Bob is now outweighed by the risk of him not meeting your valuation.  It's time to take the sure thing with John."
