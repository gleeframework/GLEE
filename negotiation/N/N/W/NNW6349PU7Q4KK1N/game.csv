,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $12000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $18000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $18000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $15000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $17500, which is the lowest I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the purchase.",17500.0,Alice,5,

"I can see we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $16750 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll sell it to you for $18000, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the purchase.",18000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made several concessions. I'm willing to meet you at $17000, and that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, I'm willing to make a deal at this price. However, if not, I'll have to consider other options.",17000.0,Alice,9,
