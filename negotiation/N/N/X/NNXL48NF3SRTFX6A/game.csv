"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on it.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,700,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This reflects the product's true worth and allows me to make a fair deal.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $2,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $1,850,000. This is a good compromise, and it's closer to what I believe is a fair price.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
