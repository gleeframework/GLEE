Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" you subtly imply the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating Bob would be overpaying.
* **Open Communication:** The tone is conversational and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation, increasing the chance of a successful sale.

**Important Note:**  Even though John offers a guaranteed $12,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.  This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit."
