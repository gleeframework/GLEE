"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",105.0,Alice,3,
