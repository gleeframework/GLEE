"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, but still below what Bob is willing to pay. This sets a strong initial position.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There's room for compromise, which is important for building a deal.
* **Friendly tone:** A positive message helps set a positive tone for the negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $105 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation room:** Even though Bob has rejected my initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can get a higher price from Bob by making a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
