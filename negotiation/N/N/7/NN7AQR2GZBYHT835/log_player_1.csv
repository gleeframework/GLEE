"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to start with a high price, aiming for a good profit. I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so I'm confident he'll at least counteroffer. I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is still a significant amount, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target value by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I believe Bob might be willing to pay this since it's what he values the product at. If he rejects, I can always fall back on selling to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $950,000.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer.  Since I have a backup option with John, I'm going to accept the offer and close the deal. It's a good profit, and I don't want to risk further negotiation that could potentially result in a lower price."
