Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $950,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise at $1,075,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to pay $1,025,000, Bob. That's a good offer, but I'm still not sure I can go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,025,000. Let's try $1,050,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my maximum budget.  I'm going to go ahead and buy the product from John for $1,000,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
