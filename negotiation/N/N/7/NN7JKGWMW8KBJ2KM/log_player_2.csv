"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $950000. This is a fair price that I think we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially do better.  He's willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $800,000.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $925000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price reflects the value I place on the product, while also acknowledging the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target:**  At $925,000, Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price range, considering Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer might lead to another round of counteroffers, which could ultimately result in a higher price or a breakdown of the negotiation. 
* **Opportunity cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks losing the deal. 

By accepting the offer, Bob saves $275,000 compared to buying from John, making it the best option at this stage."
