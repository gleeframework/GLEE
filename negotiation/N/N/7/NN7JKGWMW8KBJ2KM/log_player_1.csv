Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1000000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $850000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $850,000 is lower than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($800,000 + some profit margin), I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

However, I need to be careful not to go too low, as the next best alternative is to sell to John for $800,000. Since Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price than John's offer, I will make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than Bob's offer.
