"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  $6,000 is a good starting point, but we can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
``` 

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $5,000 is still a decent price for me, and it leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has increased her price, but it's still not acceptable.  We can likely get a lower price through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to show that I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to get a good deal. $5,500 is a fair middle ground between our previous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is continuing to increase her price.  While it's tempting to accept as we are nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  We're still significantly below the $10,000 price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again to show that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  $6,000 is a good compromise point, and it's still a significant savings compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is continuing to increase her price.  It's tempting to accept, as we are getting close to the final rounds, but it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. We're still significantly below the $10,000 price from John, so there's room to continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

I'm going to increase my offer one last time to show Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still trying to get a good deal. $6,500 is a good compromise point, and it's still a significant savings compared to John's price. I'm hoping Alice will finally accept this offer, as we are nearing the end of our negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but with only one round left, and Alice continuing to increase her price, it's likely that Alice will not accept a counteroffer. It's better to guarantee the product at a price that's still within my budget, rather than risk getting nothing at all.  While $10,000 is not ideal, it's a good backup option."
