"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. How does $14,000 sound? I know it's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a good price as well. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is decent, you know you have a fallback option with John at $15,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might prompt her to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal."
