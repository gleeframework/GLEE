Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $80 is the absolute highest I can go.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**  

Bob has reached his maximum price of $80. This is less than the $120 John is offering. Continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to result in a better deal. Accepting John's offer guarantees a profit and avoids further risk of a stalemate with Bob."
