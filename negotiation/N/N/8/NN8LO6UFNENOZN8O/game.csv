"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $150 for it.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $150 is a little too low for me, as it's worth more to me than that. I'm willing to come down to $160. Let's see if we can meet in the middle!",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $155?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
