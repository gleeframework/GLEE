Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering the return you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and the ""exclusive"" nature of the offer to entice Bob.
* **Backup Plan:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice is secure knowing she can sell to John for $800,000."
