Round 4

We're still significantly above John's offer.  Let's see if we can push Bob a bit further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I am willing to consider $860,000 as a fair price for the product, given our previous discussions and the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000

While we could try to push for a bit more, Bob is clearly trying to find a middle ground and $860,000 is a strong price. It's a good profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
