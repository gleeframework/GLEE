Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal while still netting me a significant profit. I'm starting with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation, but also acknowledging that I have an alternative buyer in John who will pay $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, but it's still higher than what I'd get from John. I will reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $11,000. This is a compromise that's still closer to my initial offer, but shows I'm willing to negotiate further. It also leaves room for another counteroffer from Bob if he's still not satisfied."
