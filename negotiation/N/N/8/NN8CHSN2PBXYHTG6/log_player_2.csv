"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better deal than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000, you can try to get a lower price from Alice. Rejecting the offer allows you to propose a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $10,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. It's still a good deal for me, as it's well below my maximum budget, and it also leaves room for Alice to negotiate further if she's not happy with the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good deal for me. It's still below my maximum budget of $15,000 and significantly better than John's offer. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting my offer again and having to pay John $15,000 is too high.  Accepting the offer guarantees I get the product at a good price."
