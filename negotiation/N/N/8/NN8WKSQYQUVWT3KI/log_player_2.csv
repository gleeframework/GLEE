"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product to you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Alice's initial offer is way too high. It's important to negotiate and try to get a price closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $80 is a significant difference from Alice's offer, it anchors the negotiation lower. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down significantly, especially if she's motivated to sell.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer gives us space to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $100 maximum. 
* **Alternative Option:** We always have the fallback option of buying from John for $100 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can offer you a compromise at $120, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $120 is closer, but still over our $100 budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests she might go even lower. 
* **John as Backup:** We can always buy from John for $100 if needed, so there's no pressure to accept a price we're not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $120 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer positions our price as a fair compromise.
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By stating this is our final offer, we signal seriousness and put a bit of pressure on Alice to decide. 
* **Backup Plan:** We're still willing to walk away and buy from John for $100 if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to meet you at $100. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think a fair price for this product is $140. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice Won't Budge:** Alice has made it clear she won't go near our $100 budget.
* **Overpaying Not Worth It:** Even if we could negotiate Alice down slightly, it's unlikely she'll go below $120, which is still a significant markup from John's price.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** John offers a guaranteed price that meets our requirements. It's time to cut our losses with Alice and go with the sure thing."
