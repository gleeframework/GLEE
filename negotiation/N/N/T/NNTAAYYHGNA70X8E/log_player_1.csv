"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a decent starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob responds before adjusting my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my ideal price, but it's closer than my minimum and I'm nearing the end of the rounds.  It's better to accept this offer rather than risk ending up with John's $12,000 offer."
