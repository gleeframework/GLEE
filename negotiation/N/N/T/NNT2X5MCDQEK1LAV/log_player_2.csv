"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still significantly higher than what the product is worth to her. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might incentivize Alice to propose a lower price closer to her own valuation."
