Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This offer is above Bob's valuation of $800,000 but leaves some room for negotiation. It also positions me to potentially make a profit if Bob accepts. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest and either counter-offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at ($1,200,000). I can try to negotiate further with Bob and see if we can reach a more agreeable price. If not, I can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous offer, but I'm still holding firm above Bob's initial counteroffer. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the product's value. This counteroffer gives Bob more incentive to accept, while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with $900,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also aware of John's offer for $1,200,000. This gives me some leverage. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one. This demonstrates my willingness to reach an agreement, while still securing a price closer to my desired value. It's a final push to see if Bob is willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly unwilling to meet my price expectations. It's time to move on to John who is willing to pay my minimum asking price.  While it's disappointing not to reach a deal with Bob, it's important to prioritize maximizing profit and ensure the product sells for a price I'm satisfied with."
