"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know your thoughts!",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $10,800? That's a fair offer, and I'm eager to make this deal happen.",10800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle on $11,200? This price is closer to your last offer and still allows me to get a fair value for the product.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation, and I'm ready to close this deal. What do you say?",11200.0,Alice,5,
