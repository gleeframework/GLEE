"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price. It's worth exploring if Bob can get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counter-offer. He's aiming to get a price closer to his maximum limit and signal that he's serious about negotiating. It's a fair starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down from her original price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7500 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $8250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $8,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate and potentially get closer to that target price.  Even though there are only a few rounds left, rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, my maximum limit. If you can accept that, we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final offer, at his maximum price. It shows Alice that he's serious about buying but won't go higher.  It's also a fair compromise, as it's the middle ground between Bob's initial counter-offer and Alice's last offer."
