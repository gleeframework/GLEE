Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Considering the value of the product and its potential, I'm prepared to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $1300000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950000 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.
