"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $11,000?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $11,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to stay closer to my target price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fair compromise that still gives you a great deal on the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $12,200? It's a small increase from your offer, but it's still a great deal for you and gets me closer to my desired price.",12200.0,Alice,5,
