"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. Can you meet me at that price?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $850000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $900000. Can you consider $880000? I really think that's a fair price for this product.",880000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $920000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. I'm willing to meet you at $915000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go below $915000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $900000, but I need you to throw in some extras or concessions to make it worth my while. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can offer a 1-year warranty and a personalized setup service, which normally costs $20000. This will add significant value to the product. Considering this, I'm willing to meet you at $920000. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay up to $910000 for the product, but I need you to throw in the 1-year warranty and personalized setup service for free. Can you consider that?",910000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll throw in the 1-year warranty and personalized setup service for free, but I need you to meet me at $925000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not willing to pay $925000. I'm willing to meet you at $900000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1200000.",900000.0,Bob,10,
