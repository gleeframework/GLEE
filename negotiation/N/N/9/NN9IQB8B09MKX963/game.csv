"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're looking for a good deal,  $8,500 is unfortunately still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000. It's closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about $8,750? I'm really hoping to close this deal and this price is within my budget. Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $8,875. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product.  Let's try to make this happen!",8875.0,Alice,5,
