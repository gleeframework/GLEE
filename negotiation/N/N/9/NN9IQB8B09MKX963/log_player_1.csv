Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $8,500 is still too low for me, considering my minimum value is $8,000.  I want to see if I can push for closer to my initial offer."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000. It's closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about $8,750? I'm really hoping to close this deal and this price is within my budget. Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate. I'm going to see if I can get Bob to budge just a little bit more before I consider selling to John."
