"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still significantly higher than the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation, and Bob can likely secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it, reflecting its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a very good price, considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price range, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice. Bob should continue negotiating and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference: I'll offer $10,250.  This is a fair price, considering your value for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,750. This is a very good price, considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice has lowered her price significantly from her initial offer, and $10,750 is within Bob's budget. Accepting the offer ensures a purchase within the desired price range and avoids further negotiation.  While there's potential to continue negotiation, the risk of losing the deal to John or reaching a stalemate is greater than the potential savings."
