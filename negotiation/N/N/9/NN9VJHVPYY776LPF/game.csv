"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it, reflecting its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a very good price, considering the value it will bring to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference: I'll offer $10,250.  This is a fair price, considering your value for the product. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,750. This is a very good price, considering the value it will bring to your business.",10750.0,Alice,5,
