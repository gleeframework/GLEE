This offer reflects my desire to ensure you receive the best value while also allowing me to maximize the return on this valuable asset. I trust that together, we can make this transaction beneficial for both parties.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is persuasive, she's starting the negotiation quite high.  You know you have a backup option with John at $1,500,000, and you'd ideally like to pay even less. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and open the door for further negotiation."
