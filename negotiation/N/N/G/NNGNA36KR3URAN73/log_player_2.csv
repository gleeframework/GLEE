"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's price of $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the value to me.  While I'm definitely interested, $14,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $13,500. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is a good compromise. Bob can still save $1,500 compared to buying from John.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting and needing to buy from John is too high.  Accepting this offer is the best option for Bob."
