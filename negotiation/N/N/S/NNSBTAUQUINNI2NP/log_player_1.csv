Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $12,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's very interested. It's unlikely he'd accept a price very close to $12,000 knowing its lower value to him.
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer (and settling for $12,000 from John) with the potential reward of securing a higher sale price."
