"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high for Bob. He's willing to pay a maximum of $8,000. It's more strategic to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price and knows his maximum is $8,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes Bob's budget clearly from the start."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than his maximum. He can continue negotiating and attempt to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible, but he needs to be realistic. Offering $9,000 shows a willingness to compromise while staying within his budget. This is a middle ground that might be more appealing to Alice than his previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but there's still room to negotiate.  He's not ready to accept a price that's significantly higher than his target.  Rejecting the offer and continuing the negotiation could lead to a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway. He's increased his offer by $1000, demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement.  This is a calculated risk, but it could be the final push needed to secure a deal. If Alice still refuses, Bob might consider going to John, but he's holding out hope for a final agreement with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 3 rounds left, the time for negotiation is dwindling. Alice's latest offer is still significantly higher than Bob's ideal price.  It's clear that Alice is not willing to budge much lower. Bob has reached his limit. It's better for him to go with John's offer and guarantee a purchase within his budget than risk losing the deal and potentially facing a higher price from Alice in the final rounds."
