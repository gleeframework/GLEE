Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your position, but $6,000 is quite low for the value this product offers. Could we meet in the middle at $12,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $7,500.  Would you consider $10,000? This is my final offer.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, it's clear she's unlikely to meet my $8,000 limit. She's stated this is her final offer, and further haggling might not be productive. It's in my best interest to take the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000 and avoid potentially wasting more time negotiating."
