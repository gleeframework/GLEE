"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
