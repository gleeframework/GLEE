Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen $15,000 as a starting price, leaving room for negotiation.  This approach balances the risk of losing a potentially higher offer from Bob with the certainty of getting $10,000 from John. 

Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Starting High:**  By starting high, I leave myself room to negotiate down if Bob counter-offers. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** A $5,000 difference between my offer and John's price gives Bob room to feel like he's getting a good deal if he counter-offers.
* **Maintaining a Safety Net:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to negotiate firmly.

Let me know if you'd like me to explore alternative offer strategies!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Can we meet in the middle at $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than $6,000, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin and John's offer of $10,000. I believe there's room for further negotiation. 

I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is closer to what I was hoping for, it's still a bit low.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would allow me to make a fair profit and ensure a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering $11,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This demonstrates willingness to compromise while still securing a better deal than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This time, I'm choosing to sell to John. Here's why:

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** It seems Bob is not willing to come close to my minimum, and further negotiation might be unproductive.
* **John's Offer is Safe:**  I can sell to John for $10,000, guaranteeing a profit and avoiding the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

While I would prefer to get a higher price, securing a guaranteed $10,000 is the most prudent decision at this point."
