"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below my bottom line. Could you do $17,000? I'm willing to be flexible if we can reach a price that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still unable to meet at $17,000. Would it be possible for you to consider $15,000? This feels like a fair compromise given the value I believe the product offers me.",15000.0,Bob,4,
