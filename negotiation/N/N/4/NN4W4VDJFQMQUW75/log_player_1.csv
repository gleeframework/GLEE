"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this exclusive product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and your minimum, you aim to anchor the negotiation in your favor. This sets the stage for potential concessions later while keeping the perceived value of the product high.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial offer provides ample room for negotiation, signaling to Bob that you are willing to work towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This first offer serves as a gauge of Bob's interest and potential negotiation style. His response will provide valuable information for shaping your strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's still early in the negotiation. You have room to counter and aim for a higher price. Accepting now leaves potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my valuation for this unique product. I could consider $1,450,000. This reflects its true value and my willingness to find a compromise."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility, Maintaining Value:**  You're showing willingness to negotiate by dropping your price, but not drastically. This signals you're serious about selling but not desperate.
* **Strategic Concession:** The $150,000 reduction is substantial enough to encourage Bob, but it still keeps the price well above his initial offer.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""true value"" reminds Bob why he's interested while framing the concession as a favor to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Trend:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, showing he's motivated. Rejecting now keeps the momentum towards a higher price.
* **Profit Potential:** $1,350,000 is better than your minimum, but you're still early in the negotiation and have room to push further.
* **Alternative Guarantee:** You have the security of John's offer, allowing you to take calculated risks with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob.  To show I'm serious about finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant investment for both of us, and I believe this price reflects a fair agreement."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** You're reducing your offer by a smaller amount ($50,000) this time. This signals you're reaching the limit of your flexibility.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** Framing the price as a ""fair agreement"" subtly shifts the focus away from individual wins and toward a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  As rounds progress, you're implicitly introducing a sense of urgency without explicitly mentioning the deadline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,400,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob's increase is smaller this time, and he's stated this is his ""highest.""  It's unlikely he'll go much further.
* **Good Return:** $1,300,000 is a significant profit above your minimum, and pushing for more risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Time Value:**  You're over halfway through your rounds. Accepting now secures the profit and avoids the risk of a stalemate leading you to accept John's lower offer later."
