I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still significantly exceeding my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to get as close to Bob's value of $1,500,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still do better. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we both can agree on."

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still significantly higher than what I could get from John, and it's getting closer to my desired range. It's time to close the deal and secure the profit."
