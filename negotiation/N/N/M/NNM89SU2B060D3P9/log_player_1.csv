Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's value of $120, but below my minimum of $150. It gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving some profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $150.  I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $135?  That's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise! However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is below my minimum of $150. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from him. It's better to sell to John now and get my minimum price."
