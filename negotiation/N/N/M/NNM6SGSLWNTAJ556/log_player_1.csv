"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and allows me to gauge his interest.  I'm also trying to build rapport by emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm going to counter Bob's offer, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12,500. That's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. I think there's a better deal to be had, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I want to keep negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you to find a price that works for both of us. However, $11,500 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is my bottom line. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
