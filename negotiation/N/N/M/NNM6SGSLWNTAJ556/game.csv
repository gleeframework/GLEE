"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12500. That's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you to find a price that works for both of us. However, $11500 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is my bottom line. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
