Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000.  I know this product is valuable to you, and this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, but still ensures a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Avoid a Lowball:**  Starting too low (e.g., below $12,000) might discourage Bob or make him think the product is less valuable than it is.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while still having John as a reliable backup buyer."
