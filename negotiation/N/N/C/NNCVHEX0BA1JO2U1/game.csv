"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind. How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to let it go for $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the gesture, I still believe that $1,500,000 is a fair price for the product within my budget constraints. I am unable to increase my offer further. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  I'm willing to come down slightly more to $1,750,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
