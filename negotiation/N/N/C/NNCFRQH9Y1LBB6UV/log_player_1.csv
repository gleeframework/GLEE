Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend less than $10000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I can't go any lower than $10,500. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. Let's meet in the middle, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $12,000.  While I'd prefer to make more, Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price, and with only a few rounds left, I don't think I'll be able to negotiate a better price.  It's important to ensure I at least get my minimum value for the product."
