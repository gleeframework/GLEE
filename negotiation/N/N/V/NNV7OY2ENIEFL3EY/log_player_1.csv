Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy with $12,000, I believe I can get a better price. I'll try to negotiate higher in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is a fair price, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $15,000? It's still a good deal for you, and allows me to get a bit closer to my value."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer of $13,500. This is a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum threshold of $12,000, and it's also a fair price for Bob.  There's no guarantee I'll get a higher offer in the next round, and it's better to take a good deal than risk ending up with less."
