"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. My initial offer is $1,400,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure I get a fair price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll see it as a good opportunity for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1,250,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
