"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's something you'll find valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $15,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $12000 just yet. The product is truly worth more, and I'm confident it will bring you significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $13500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible and Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above his desired price. He can try to negotiate further."
