"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  As Bob, I want to save money. While $15,000 is my maximum, there's no reason to pay that right away. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This is aggressive but might encourage Alice to negotiate. If she rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffers in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $12,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a better deal. I'll counter again to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $11,000.  I'm trying to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good price. This is a compromise that might be more appealing to her than my initial $10,000 offer."
