"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
