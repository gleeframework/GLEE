"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a significant profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product for that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
