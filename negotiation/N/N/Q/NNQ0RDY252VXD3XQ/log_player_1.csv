Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Here's why I chose $14,000:

* **Higher than Bob's value:**  $14,000 is still more than what the product is worth to Bob ($8,000). This gives him some incentive to buy, especially if he believes he can resell it later for a profit.
* **Lower than John's value:** $14,000 is less than what John is willing to pay ($15,000). This means I still have some room to negotiate if Bob rejects the offer.

By offering $14,000, I'm maximizing my chances of getting a sale with Bob while still having a backup option with John if needed."
