"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's still below Bob's perceived value ($150) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging to keep Bob engaged.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm not setting a price too close to my minimum ($100) to allow for counteroffers and potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $105 is closer to my minimum, it's still not worth it to me.  
* **There's still room for negotiation:** I have 8 rounds left, and there's potential to get closer to my target price.  
* **Keeping options open:**  Rejecting allows me to send a counteroffer and try to get a higher price.  While selling to John is an option, it's better to explore if I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? I'm confident you'll be happy with this product, and I want to make sure we both feel good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm  rejecting Bob's offer, but instead of completely rejecting it, I'm making a counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation moving forward and shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Meeting in the middle:** I've offered to split the difference between my last offer and Bob's offer. This is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm open to finding a solution.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm still using positive language and highlighting the value of the product to keep Bob motivated."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a fair profit, Alice. How about $110? That's a solid offer, and I'm eager to get my hands on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While I'd prefer to get closer to $120,  $110 is just above my minimum of $100 and a good compromise. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting this offer could lead to further negotiation rounds where Bob might offer even less.
* **Time is a factor:**  We're already at Round 4, and I have to balance maximizing profit with potentially losing the deal."
