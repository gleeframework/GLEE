"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth at least $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110? That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $110.** This is still lower than John's price of $120.
* **Bob's goal is to save money.** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject again, and Bob might end up paying more at John's.
* **The $110 offer is a good compromise.** It's in Bob's best interest to accept and secure the product at a good price."
