Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation to potentially reach a price closer to Bob's value of $120. This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm only able to go up to $90 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below what you'd ideally like to get. Rejecting Bob's offer gives you the opportunity to push for a higher price.  You can try to counter with a price closer to your ideal target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more for this product. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50? I'm ready to finalize the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good compromise. While $92.50 is slightly lower than your last counter-offer, it's still a better deal than selling to John for $80. You are also getting close to Bob's perceived value of $120, which suggests that further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price. Accepting this offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
