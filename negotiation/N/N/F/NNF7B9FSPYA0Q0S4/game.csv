"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product to your specific business model is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000. I think this is a very fair compromise that still reflects the substantial return on investment you'll see.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
