"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I believe holds immense value, for $1000000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident the potential returns will be substantial. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still significantly above your budget. You need to negotiate to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, given its potential.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  A $300,000 reduction is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your intent to negotiate seriously.
* **Focus on Value:** The message highlights the product's potential, implying you're not simply trying to lowball Alice. 
* **Open to Compromise:** The message ends by expressing a willingness to find a middle ground, keeping the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $700000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the potential benefits. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your position, but $900,000 is still too high.  You have some room to negotiate further. By rejecting this offer, you can make another counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which represents a fair compromise. This offer is still significantly higher than my initial counter, demonstrating my commitment to making this deal work."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Compromise:**  You're showing flexibility by increasing your offer, but still pushing for a better deal.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning that this offer is ""significantly higher"" than your initial counter strengthens your position and implies you're serious about buying. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** The ""fair compromise"" language aims to frame your offer in a positive light."
