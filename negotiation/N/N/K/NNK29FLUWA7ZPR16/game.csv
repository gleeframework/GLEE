"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I believe holds immense value, for $1000000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident the potential returns will be substantial. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product, given its potential.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the potential benefits. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which represents a fair compromise. This offer is still significantly higher than my initial counter, demonstrating my commitment to making this deal work.",800000.0,Bob,4,
