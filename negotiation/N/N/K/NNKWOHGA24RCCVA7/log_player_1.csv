# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal, and while I respect the value you place on the product, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. I would like to suggest a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this might be a mutually acceptable compromise.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's not worth the risk of him going even lower. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000 which is a fair deal."
