Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'd be willing to offer $900,000 for it, given its worth to you.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Bob's offer:
