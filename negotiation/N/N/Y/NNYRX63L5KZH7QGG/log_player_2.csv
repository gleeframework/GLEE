"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to try to negotiate, especially when the initial offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget.  You can likely get a better price than $50, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 30} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will test the waters and see how low she's willing to go. If she rejects this offer, I'll adjust my counteroffer in the next round based on her reaction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $40. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $40
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. While $40 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still confident I can get it lower. I'll reject the offer and try to get closer to my target price of $30."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 35} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $35. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price.  It's a good compromise that could potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still not budging much from her original price. While $45 is tempting, it's still above my target price of $30-$35.  I'm not ready to give up just yet and will keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems to be stuck around $45.  I'm going to meet her halfway and offer $40. It's a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still keeping the price within my budget. If she rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider buying from John, as it seems the negotiation is going to be tough."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $42.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $42.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $42.50, which is very close to my initial counteroffer of $40.  It's getting increasingly likely that she won't go lower, and I'm starting to run out of rounds.  To avoid risking buying from John at $100, I'll accept this offer and save myself $57.50."
