"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good practice to begin negotiations with an offer that's higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique features and potential,"" I'm subtly emphasizing the value of the product, even though I'm aiming for a price well above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and suggests that this is just a starting point, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation process.

I'm starting significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my own minimum. While this carries the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright, it sets the stage for potentially reaching a much higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for this product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above his own perceived value of the product, which is a good sign. It indicates he's quite interested.  However, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of the product's value range, I understand your position. To move forward, I'm willing to consider $1,750,000.  This reflects the true worth of the product's unique capabilities."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've lowered my price significantly from the initial offer, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to find an agreement.
* **Justification:** I'm still emphasizing the ""unique capabilities"" to keep the perceived value high.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer is halfway between Bob's offer and my desired selling price.  It leaves room for further negotiation but keeps me anchored above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the value in the product, $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to come up to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering our individual valuations. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. There's no need to risk further negotiation or potentially losing the deal by trying to push for a higher price, especially since I have a guaranteed offer from John at this same amount."
