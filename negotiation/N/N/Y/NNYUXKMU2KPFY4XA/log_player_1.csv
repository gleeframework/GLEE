Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $7,000.  This is my best offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,200 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $7,000. It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Bob seems firm on his $7,000 offer. It's unlikely we'll reach a price that satisfies us both.  It's best to take John's guaranteed $8,000."
