I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's a strong starting point that shows I value the product and expect a decent return. However, I'm open to negotiation depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's well below my minimum acceptable price and I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still offering a price far below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me my minimum and saves time and effort in further negotiation."
