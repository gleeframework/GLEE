"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you might be interested in.  I'm asking $150 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $150 and John is offering the product for that price, it's the most logical choice to buy from John. There's no need to negotiate with Alice as you're already getting the product at your desired price."
