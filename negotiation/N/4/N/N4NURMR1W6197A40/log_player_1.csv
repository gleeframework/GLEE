{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $950,000 is well above your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still $50,000 wiggle room to potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob if he's willing.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  The price is still below the value he places on the product, giving him incentive to accept. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. I'm offering $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a higher price. You can leverage the fact that the product is worth more to him than to John, giving you a stronger negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This ensures a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $875,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now only $75,000 below your minimum.  While you might be able to squeeze out a bit more, it's likely not worth the risk of him walking away.  Accepting his offer secures a good profit and avoids any further negotiation."
