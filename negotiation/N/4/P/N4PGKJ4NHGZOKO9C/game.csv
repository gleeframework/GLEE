"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  This is a fair price that recognizes your investment, while also ensuring that I can get a good return on my own investment. Let's see if we can make this work.",700000.0,Bob,2,
