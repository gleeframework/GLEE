"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could we settle on something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $750,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering both the value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and seeing if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
