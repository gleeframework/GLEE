Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which still represents a good value for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly unique and $800,000 falls significantly short of what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,250,000 is still outside my comfort zone, but I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant investment for me and a fair price for the product's value. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his latest offer is still significantly below John's offer. It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap quickly enough to justify continuing negotiations with Bob. Accepting John's offer guarantees the $1,000,000 value and avoids further risk of Bob lowering his offer or stalling negotiations."
