Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $130.  I think it could really benefit you."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Maximizing Profit:**  This price point aims to maximize your potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob. 

By starting high, you give yourself a cushion.  If Bob counter-offers, you can potentially still settle on a price higher than $80 while ensuring you don't miss out on a sale."
