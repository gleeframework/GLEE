"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,500 for it. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair price considering your initial ask, and it's within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm really trying to stay within $9,000, and I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,125? This would be a fair compromise and allow us to close the deal.",9125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $9,125 is closer, I'm still a bit off from where I need to be.  I'm willing to drop to $9,200, which is a fair compromise considering my initial asking price.  Let's close this deal. ",9200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a certain price, and I appreciate your continued flexibility.  While $9,200 is still above my budget, I'm willing to go up to $9,150. This is a fair compromise, and it's the very best I can do.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",9150.0,Bob,8,
