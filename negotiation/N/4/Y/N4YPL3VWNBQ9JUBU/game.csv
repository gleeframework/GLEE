"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can meet you in the middle at $150, which is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $150 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $130. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it gives you a decent profit.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you a compromise at $140, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you trying to work with me. While $140 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get it for $135. This would still be a profitable deal for you, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",135.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you at $137.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",137.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really close to my budget limit, but I'm willing to go to $135.  This is the very best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",135.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're close to your budget limit, but I'm not willing to go back to $135. I can offer you a final compromise at $139. This is the last price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this point.",139.0,Alice,9,
