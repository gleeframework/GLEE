Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000.  Let me know what you think! "", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering $20,000, which is significantly more than my minimum value of $15,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if necessary.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value. 
* **No pressure:** I'm not explicitly stating a deadline or limited offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  If he rejects the offer, I'll sell to John for $15,000.
* **Negotiate if needed:** If Bob counters, I'll assess his offer and determine if it's worth negotiating further.  My goal is to maximize my profit while still potentially making a deal with Bob."
