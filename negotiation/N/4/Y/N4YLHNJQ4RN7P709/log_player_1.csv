Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum.  Any deal needs to bridge this gap.

**The Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the current valuations, you need to either:

1. **Convince Bob to value the product higher:**  This is difficult and unlikely in a short negotiation. 
2. **Accept you'll likely sell to John:**  Knowing this, you can try for a slightly higher price from Bob, hoping he acts irrationally or overvalues the product.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I move forward with another interested party. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You create a sense of exclusivity and urgency.
* **High Anchor:**  $1,600,000 is above Bob's perceived value but below your guaranteed price. 
* **Limited Time:**  Pressures Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be prepared to walk away:** There's a high chance Bob will reject this offer.  That's okay; you have John as a guaranteed sale.
* **Don't reveal John's offer:** Keep your backup option secret to maintain negotiating power. 
* **This is a bold strategy:** It aims high, hoping Bob might surprise you. However, the most likely outcome is you'll proceed with John."
