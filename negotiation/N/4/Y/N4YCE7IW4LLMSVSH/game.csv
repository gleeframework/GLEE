"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,
