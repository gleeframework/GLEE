"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to pay more. You can counteroffer Alice and try to negotiate a lower price, but you always have the option of buying from John if you can't reach a deal with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her original offer, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You can always buy the product from John for $8,000. You can try to counteroffer Alice again and see if she'll come down further, but you're not obligated to."
