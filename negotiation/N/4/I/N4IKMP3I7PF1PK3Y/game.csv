"I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's meet halfway between our last offers.  I'm willing to go down to $1,275,000.  This is a great price for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm willing to pay $1,225,000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 is simply too low. It's important for me to get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to come down a little more, but my final offer is $1,250,000.  Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll offer $1,225,000 again, but I'll throw in an additional concession: I'll pay within 30 days instead of the usual 60 days. Can we close the deal at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,225,000. I am willing to come down to $1,240,000, but I cannot accept your 30-day payment term.  I need payment within the standard 60 days. This is my final offer.",1240000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,240,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll offer $1,230,000. I'm willing to stick with the standard 60-day payment term. Can we close the deal at $1,230,000?",1230000.0,Bob,8,
