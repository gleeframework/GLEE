"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for this product, considering my maximum budget is $10000.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13500. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this unique item. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."
"I understand that $13500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $9000 and $13500. How about we settle on $11250? It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's still a great deal for you.",11250.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $11250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle on $10500? This is the absolute highest I can go, considering my budget. Let's find a way to make this work.",10500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $12000, so how about we try $11750? It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's still a great deal for you."
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll meet you halfway between $10500 and $12000, as I mentioned before. That would put the price at $11250, but I'll give you a slight discount to $11750. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can make a deal.",11750.0,Alice,5,,
