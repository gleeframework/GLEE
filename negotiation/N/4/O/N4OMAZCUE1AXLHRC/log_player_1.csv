"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd be interested. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $110, slightly higher than my minimum price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing it as a good deal for Bob, suggesting he'd be interested. This helps build rapport and encourages him to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's being forced to accept my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  While $90 is better than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still below my minimum desired price of $100.
* **Negotiation room:**  I can still potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer:** John is a safety net, but I'm not ready to sell to him yet, as I believe I can likely get closer to my minimum with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to $100 to make this work. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise,  showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired minimum. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm reiterating Bob's interest and framing my counteroffer as a compromise, making it more appealing.
* **Specific number:** I've presented a concrete number for a counteroffer, making it easier for Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $92. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $92 is only $8 below my minimum price of $100. 
* **Limited rounds:** We are already on round 4, and with only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $100.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While $92 is not my ideal price, there's still a possibility that I can negotiate a higher price in future rounds if Bob is open to it."
