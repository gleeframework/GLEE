"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm open to discussing further. ",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? I feel that reflects a fair price considering the current market.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. Its unique features and market potential justify a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's true value.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise and would allow us to close this deal quickly.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting close!  To show my willingness to close this deal, I'm prepared to come down slightly. How about $1,000,000 even? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really making me work for this!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
