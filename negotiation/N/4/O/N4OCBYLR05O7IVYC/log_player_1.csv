"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and it's a significant profit for me.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to him, he has incentive to negotiate, but I'm still leaving a decent margin for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take $1,000,000,  I'm confident I can get closer to my target value. I'll reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still leaves me a good profit margin.  It's also closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a slightly higher price. I believe I can still get a better deal, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is only $50,000 more than Bob's last offer, but it's still a significant profit for me.  I'm hoping this is a good compromise that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is my minimum acceptable price.  Bob's offer is the same as John's offer, so I'll accept it and close the deal. I'm happy to avoid any more negotiation rounds."
