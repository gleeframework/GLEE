"I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. It's a one-time offer, so if you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my original offer of $15,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to move on to another seller.",15000.0,Bob,4,
