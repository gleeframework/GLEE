"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially pricing it at $20,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering what you'll gain from it.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is too high for me. While I recognize the value of this product, my maximum budget is $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a way to bridge the gap.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $17,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still willing to negotiate, but $17,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that $14,000 is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on the product and my need to stay within my budget.  Let's find a compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
