"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll see the value in this product. Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise.  This is a one-time offer, so let's finalize this deal!",10500.0,Alice,5,
