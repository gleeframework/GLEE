"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a substantial gain. If he rejects, I'll adjust my next offer based on his counteroffer.  I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for less than $1,500,000, which is what I can get from John.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,650,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a profit. It also shows Bob that I am willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell. Hopefully, this will lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is a good compromise. It's slightly lower than my initial asking price but still  a better deal than selling to John for $1,500,000. It's time to close the deal."
