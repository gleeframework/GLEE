{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase [product name]. I know you recognize its value, and I'm confident it would be a significant asset to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,750,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Value Asset:** The product holds significant value for both you and Bob ($1,500,000). This means there's room for negotiation but also a strong chance Bob will pay a premium to secure it.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000. This provides a strong safety net and allows you to aim higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,750,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts. You gain a significant profit above your minimum, and Bob acquires an asset he values.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the higher price.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. You might adjust your offer based on Bob's personality, your negotiation style, and any additional information you gather about his needs and motivations."
