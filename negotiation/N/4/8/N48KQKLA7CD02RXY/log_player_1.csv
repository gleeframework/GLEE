Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $9,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum selling price ($10,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $9,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, bringing the final price closer to his maximum. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, potentially increasing his willingness to pay.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, we have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so any price Bob accepts above that is a bonus."
