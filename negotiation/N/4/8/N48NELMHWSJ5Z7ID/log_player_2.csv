"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice first.  $12,000 is too high, and we have 10 rounds to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a strong counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This should open up the negotiation and give us room to find a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my target, I'm still confident we can get a better price with further negotiation.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to show flexibility and willingness to meet halfway.  $9,500 is a good compromise point, and it's still within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to my target price, I'm still determined to save as much as possible. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to close the deal for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm making a final counteroffer at my target price. If Alice doesn't accept, I'll go with John's offer."
