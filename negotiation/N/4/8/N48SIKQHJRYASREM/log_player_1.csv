Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your potential gain. Here's a balanced approach:

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth in the market."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Targeting Bob's Upper Limit:** By starting at $1,350,000, you're aiming for a price that's significantly below your guaranteed sale price but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" creates a sense of scarcity and desirability, subtly justifying the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording implies you're open to discussing the price further if Bob has concerns.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to give yourself more wiggle room.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you're under time pressure, a slightly lower offer might be strategic to ensure a quick sale. 

**Remember:** The goal is to strike a deal that's beneficial for both parties.  Good luck with your negotiation!"
