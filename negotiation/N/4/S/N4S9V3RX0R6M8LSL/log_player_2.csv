"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a one-time price of $90. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your max price:** $100
* **Alice's price:** $90
* **John's price:** $100

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum price point. You can get the product for cheaper by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
