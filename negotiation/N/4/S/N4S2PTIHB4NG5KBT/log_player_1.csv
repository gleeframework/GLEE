Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am proposing a price of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but  $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1050000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our positions.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
