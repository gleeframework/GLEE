"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. I think that's a fair price for the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $775,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $825,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  This is my final offer.  If you aren't able to meet this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",825000.0,Alice,5,
