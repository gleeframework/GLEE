``` 

This offer is aggressive, but it leaves room for negotiation. By starting high, you show confidence in your product's value and give yourself room to come down a bit if needed. You also acknowledge that you have another buyer ready to purchase for $800,000, which adds pressure to Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. You have the opportunity to potentially get a better deal by counteroffering."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

While Bob is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, his offer is still below $800,000. You have the opportunity to potentially get a better deal by counteroffering, especially since you have John as a backup buyer."
