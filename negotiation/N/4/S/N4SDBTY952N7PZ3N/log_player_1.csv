"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum. This gives us room for negotiation. 
* **Framing:**  The message highlights the potential value to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum of $1,500,000 as possible. This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and understand his negotiating style. I'm prepared to counteroffer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is well above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  It's a fair price considering my valuation and the fact that I could purchase it elsewhere for the same amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:**  Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While his offer is low, Bob's message indicates a willingness to negotiate, which gives me hope we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer in the next round. My goal is to slowly bring the price up, ideally to a point close to my desired range of $1,500,000. I am also keeping the option to sell to John in mind as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I understand your budget, but this product is truly unique and worth more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still allows for a good margin for you, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's continue the discussion."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm coming down from my initial offer but still staying well above Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a reasonable price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is unique and worth more than his initial offer.
* **Focus on Benefits:** I'm framing my offer as a good deal for Bob, allowing him to make a profit.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. By offering $1,250,000, I hope to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price range. If he rejects this offer, I will continue to adjust my counteroffers in subsequent rounds. I am also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still higher than I can go at this time. I'm committed to purchasing this product, but my budget is firmly set at $800000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1025000? This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial one, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Continued:**  Bob seems committed to buying and is willing to negotiate, which suggests there is still room to raise the price.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer again in the next round. I'm aiming to slowly increase the price, but I'm aware that we're running out of rounds.  I'm also prepared to sell to John if a suitable deal with Bob can't be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the product's unique features and its value to you, I'm confident we can find a more agreeable price.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant concession on my part, but it's a price that reflects the value we're both seeking. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Adjustment:**  I'm making a smaller reduction this time, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Highlighting Value Again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique qualities and its worth to him, subtly putting pressure on him to meet me halfway.
* **Collaborative Tone:**  I'm emphasizing a collaborative approach to reaching a mutually beneficial deal, further encouraging Bob to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where I can maximize my profits while still keeping Bob engaged. This offer is a good compromise, and if he rejects it, I will continue to adjust my counteroffers in the remaining rounds. However, I am prepared to accept a lower price if necessary, as long as it's above my minimum of $1,500,000. I will also continue to assess the possibility of selling to John if a deal with Bob seems unlikely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $1150000 is still too high for me.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $950000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end and represents the absolute maximum I can afford.  I believe this offer is fair considering the product's value to both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation process, and I have only 4 rounds left.  
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a very attractive option, but I want to see if I can get closer to that price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer again in the next round. I need to find a way to raise the price while acknowledging that I'm running out of time.  If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I might need to consider accepting his offer or selling to John to avoid losing out on a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  However, $950,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to make one final concession and drop the price to $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:**  I'm making a smaller reduction this time, emphasizing that this is my final offer.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that we're running out of time, hoping to make him more willing to compromise.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  I'm framing this as a mutually beneficial solution, highlighting the sacrifices I've made to meet him halfway.

**Strategy:**

This is a crucial round. My goal is to inch closer to my minimum price while still keeping Bob engaged. If he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to consider selling to John, as we are getting very close to the end of our negotiation."
