"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for countering. I appreciate the flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  Could you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's try to close this gap. How about $9,000? This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to find a compromise.",9000.0,Alice,5,
