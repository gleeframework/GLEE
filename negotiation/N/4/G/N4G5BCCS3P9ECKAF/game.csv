"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, $18000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $17000 for the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $17000 is still above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $15000. It's a fair price, and it allows you to make a profit as well.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking with your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on my profit. My revised offer is $16500 for the product.",16500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $16500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm ready to close the deal right now for $15500, but that's my final offer.  I can always go with John's offer for $15000, so I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",15500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're eager to close the deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. My revised offer is $16000 for the product.",16000.0,Alice,7,
