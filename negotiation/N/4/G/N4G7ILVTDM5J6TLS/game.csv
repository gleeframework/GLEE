"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. That still leaves some room for profit for me and is a good price for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can close this deal!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer, but $12,500 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and do $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, so how about we settle this right now at $11,500?  That's my final offer.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,500 just isn't working for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11,750, meeting you in the middle. If we can't close this deal at this price, I may have to consider other options.  Let's get this done.",11750.0,Alice,7,
