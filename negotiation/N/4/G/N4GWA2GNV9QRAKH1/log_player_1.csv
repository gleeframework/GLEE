Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $10,000 is better than nothing, I know the product is worth more to Bob. I'll try to negotiate a price closer to my desired $11,500."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,750? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 10750}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a little lower than I'd hoped for, it's close enough to my minimum and it's better than selling to John. I'd rather have the product go to someone who values it highly.  There's always a chance I could get a better deal later on, but I'm not going to risk losing the sale altogether."
