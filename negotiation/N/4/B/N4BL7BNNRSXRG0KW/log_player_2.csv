Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still looking to make a profit.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,100.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still focused on saving as much money as possible. While $11,100 is a good price, he's still hoping to get it for a little less. He's willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if he can get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. I'm still hoping to close the gap a little more. Would you consider $10,950? I believe this price would be fair to both of us and allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10950}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,950, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $11,050. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to get the price down to $10,950, but Alice has been firm in her negotiations.  At this point,  Alice's offer of $11,050 is the closest he's gotten to his target price, and he only has a few rounds left. He realizes that if he rejects this offer, there is a chance Alice will either stick to her $11,050 price or even raise it.  He also knows that he can always buy from John for $12,000 if he doesn't reach an agreement.

Accepting Alice's offer secures the product for a price that is still lower than buying from John and closer to his desired price.  This is a good compromise, considering the limited rounds remaining."
