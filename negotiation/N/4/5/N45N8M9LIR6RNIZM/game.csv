"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1000000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact I can purchase it elsewhere for $1000000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. Considering the value you place on the product is $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1025000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
