"Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its high value to you, I am offering it at a special introductory price of $950,000. This is an exclusive opportunity to secure such a valuable asset at a price that is still significantly above market value. I look forward to your consideration.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, the price you're asking is a bit steep for me at the moment.  Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of this, I am prepared to consider a price closer to your offer. Therefore, I am now offering the product at $850,000. This price still maintains a significant premium over its value to you while being more accessible than my initial proposal. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  While $850,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we've been able to narrow down the price. To further explore a compromise, I propose a final offer of $825,000 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable midpoint between our previous discussions, aiming to ensure both parties are satisfied with the transaction. I hope this offer is acceptable and allows us to conclude this negotiation successfully.",825000.0,Alice,5,
