,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? That way, we both get a fair price.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $775,000? I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. I understand you're working with a budget, but $775,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. Let's try $800,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",800000.0,Alice,5,
