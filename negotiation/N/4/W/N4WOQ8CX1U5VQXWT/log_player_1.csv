"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. 

* **Aggressive:**  This approach allows me to potentially capture a large profit if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Testing the waters:**  By starting high, I can gauge Bob's interest level and see if he's willing to pay close to my desired price.

If Bob rejects, I'll use his counteroffer to adjust my strategy for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a decent price and closer to my minimum, I'm not satisfied with the outcome. Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, and I believe I can secure a better deal. 

* **Potential for higher price:**  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point with more negotiation. 
* **Testing Bob's limits:**  By rejecting his offer, I can signal that I'm willing to stand firm on my expectations.

I will make a counteroffer in the next round to try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to raise the price slightly from Bob's offer to $9,800. This shows him that I'm willing to compromise but also that I value the product highly.

* **Strategic compromise:**  I'm signaling that I'm open to a deal, but I'm not willing to significantly lower my asking price.
* **Testing for agreement:**  This offer puts the pressure back on Bob. If he accepts, I get a price closer to my desired outcome. If he rejects, I can further analyze his willingness to pay.

My strategy is to gradually reduce my offer in subsequent rounds, but only if Bob continues to reject."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has lowered his offer again to $9,300, but it's still a significant profit for me. However, I believe I can still push for a higher price.

* **Room for improvement:**  There's still a gap between our desired prices, and I'm not ready to settle just yet.
* **Testing the limit:**  By rejecting this offer, I'm pushing Bob to see how far he's willing to go.

I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than his last offer in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $9,600.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profit.

* **Strategic compromise:**  I'm lowering my price, but not drastically. This demonstrates that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Testing for finality:**  This is a strong offer that leaves little room for further concessions on my part. If Bob rejects, I might consider selling to John for a slightly lower profit, as we're nearing the halfway point in the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and the price gap has narrowed significantly. While $9,200 is slightly below my ideal outcome, it's still a good profit for me. 

* **Minimizing risk:** Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob entirely, especially as we are nearing the halfway point.
* **Reasonable profit:** $9,200 is a substantial profit compared to my minimum value of $8,000.

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most strategic move at this point. I can avoid further negotiation and secure a good price for the product."
