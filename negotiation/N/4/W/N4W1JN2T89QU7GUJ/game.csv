"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to move from my original price.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $11,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
