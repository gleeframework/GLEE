"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $14500. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not satisfied with the price. Could we possibly agree on $14000?",14000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I see you're still interested in the product, but we're not quite there yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering $14150. I think it's a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into this negotiation. What do you think?",14150.0,Alice,5,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm counteroffering $14000, but I'll throw in a free additional feature that's worth $500. That way, you'll get a better deal than you initially proposed. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Thank you for the additional feature, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $14000 is the right price for me. I would like to stick with my original proposal of $14000 without any additional features.",14000.0,Bob,8,,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but I need to make it clear that this is my final concession. I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm selling the product to you for $14000, and that's it. No more negotiations. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,9,,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice. However, after careful consideration, I am unable to accept $14000 for the product. I will instead purchase the product from John for $12000.",12000.0,Bob,10,,
