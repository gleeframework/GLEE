# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12000, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is significantly better than buying from John for $12,000.  It saves Bob $2,000, even though it's a little more than Alice's perceived worth of $8,000.  Bob's goal is to save money, and this offer achieves that."
