"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, reflecting the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value you'll get from the product, while also allowing me to recoup my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still above my maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate, hoping to get a better deal. Buying from John is always an option, but it's not the most advantageous financially, even if it guarantees a purchase."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to recoup your investment, but $1,150,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. I'm hoping we can find a way to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the payment terms. I can offer a 2% discount if you're willing to pay within 30 days. This would bring the price down to $1,137,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,137,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,137,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, the payment term adjustment adds complexity and uncertainty.  It's also still above my maximum budget. At this point, buying from John is the most financially secure option, ensuring a known price and avoiding potential complications."
