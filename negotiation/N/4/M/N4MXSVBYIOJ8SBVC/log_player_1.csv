Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, reflecting the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still below my target.

This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value you'll get from the product, while also allowing me to recoup my investment."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This would bring the price down to $1,137,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1137500}"
