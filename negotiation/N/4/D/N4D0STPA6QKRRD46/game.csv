"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. Considering your latest proposal, I am prepared to offer the product for $687,500. This is the highest price we can reasonably lower from our original asking price, while still maintaining a fair profit margin for us. I hope this aligns better with your budget considerations.",687500.0,Alice,5,
