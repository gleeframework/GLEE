"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $13,500 for you, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground, what do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,4,
