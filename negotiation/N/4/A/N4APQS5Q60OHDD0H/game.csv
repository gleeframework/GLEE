"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can come to a fair agreement. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $7,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $8,750?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it, and it's a fair compromise on my end.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $7,000 just won't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get at least $8,000 for this.  How about we settle on $8,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
