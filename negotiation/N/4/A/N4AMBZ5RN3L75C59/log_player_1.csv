Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. It's worth $120 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  This is a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $100 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, increasing my profit.
* **Ensure a Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
