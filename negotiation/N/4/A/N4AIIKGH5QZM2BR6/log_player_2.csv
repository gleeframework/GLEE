"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be a significant asset to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is considerably higher than that. I could consider letting it go for $1,700,000.  This is a fair offer considering its potential worth.

You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,350,000 is lower than I'd like to go.  My final offer is $1,550,000. This is a firm price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

**Reasoning:** Alice is holding firm at a price that is not advantageous to you. While she came down slightly, $1,550,000 is still significantly higher than your alternative option of buying from John for $1,200,000. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will yield a price you're willing to accept."
