"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $14,500, considering its value to me and the potential benefits for you. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $13,000 for this product.  Let's find a middle ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's important to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a reasonable compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $11,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $12,500. This is a good deal for both of us, as I'm losing some profit and you're getting a great product at a lower price.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for understanding. I'm willing to go up slightly, how about $12,100?",12100.0,Bob,6,
