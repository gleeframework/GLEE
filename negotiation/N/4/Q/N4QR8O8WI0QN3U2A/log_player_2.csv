Bob should reject Alice's offer. $13,000 is over his budget and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11750.

While Alice's offer is better than her original price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. There's no guarantee she'll go lower, and it's not worth the risk of potentially losing the product altogether. It's better to take the sure thing and buy from John."
