"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm offering it to you at a great price. How does $90 sound?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100.
* Alice is offering it for $90.
* You can get it from John for $100. 

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your personal value of $100. You can get it for your maximum value from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
