"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 feels fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a high profit. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and frames the offer as a potential win for Bob. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's eagerness and sets the stage for subsequent rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is substantial, it's still considerably below his perceived value of $1,000,000. Rejecting this offer allows for further negotiation. We have room to bargain before considering John's guaranteed $800,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my initial price to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** We acknowledge Bob's offer but counter with a smaller decrease, maintaining a strong position. We're still aiming for a price that reflects the product's high value to both parties.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This common negotiation tactic suggests fairness and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to our desired range.
* **Continued Focus on Value:** The message reiterates the product's inherent worth, subtly reminding Bob of its potential benefits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $875,000 is a significant profit margin above our minimum of $800,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we might be able to push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain from further negotiation is unlikely to be substantial. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away altogether. Accepting avoids these risks and closes the deal."
