"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of offering the product to you for $11,500. It's a bit higher than your top price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? That seems fair to both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence.  $11,250 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to close the gap.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price considering we're both willing to compromise.  What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $11,200. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,7,
