"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm still looking to get a better price for it. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1200000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
