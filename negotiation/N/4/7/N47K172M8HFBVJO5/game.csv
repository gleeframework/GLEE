"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find very useful. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of this product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit above your budget, but $6,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to settle for $7,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'll meet you at $9,000. This is my final offer on the low end, and I'm hoping we can seal the deal at this price.",9000.0,Alice,5,
