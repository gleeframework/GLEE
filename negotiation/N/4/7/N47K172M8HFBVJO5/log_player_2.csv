Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit above your budget, but $6,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'll meet you at $9,000. This is my final offer on the low end, and I'm hoping we can seal the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above your maximum budget and John's offer. At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go down to $8,000. Cutting your losses and buying from John guarantees you get the product at the best price for you."
