"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get it for even less. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This is a strategic move to try and get Alice to come down to a price closer to her own value ($10,000).  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can gradually increase his offer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's desired price. While it's lower than her original offer, Bob still has room to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate. However, he's still keeping it below Alice's latest offer, showing that he's determined to get a good price.  This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is getting closer to Bob's preferred price, he's still not at his target yet.  There are a few rounds left, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.  He's also not yet at risk of being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing a willingness to compromise. He's aiming for a price in the middle ground between his last offer and Alice's latest offer. With only a few rounds remaining, it's important to find a solution that's acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, Bob is still holding out for a better deal. There are only a few rounds left, but he believes he can still get a better price.  If he rejects the offer, he can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to his target.  However, it's important to note that time is running out, and he needs to be cautious about getting too greedy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his limit, but he's still trying to get a better price.  He's raising his offer significantly from the previous round, hoping to push Alice towards a compromise. With only two rounds left, it's a risky move, but potentially rewarding if Alice accepts.  If she doesn't, he'll need to make a final decision in the next round about whether to buy from her or go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough situation for Bob.  While Alice is continuing to lower her price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's desired price.  He has only one round left to negotiate, and with the risk of getting stuck with a higher price, it's wiser to take the guaranteed price from John. This ensures that Bob gets the product while staying within his budget.  He also avoids potentially getting stuck in a final round with a high price from Alice."
