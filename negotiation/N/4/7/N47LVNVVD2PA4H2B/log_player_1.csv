Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This is a strategic opening move, aiming to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm offering a price of $875,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has remained consistent with his offer of $850,000, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.  Accepting his offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of further rounds potentially leading to a lower price or a sale to John at the lower value of $800,000."
