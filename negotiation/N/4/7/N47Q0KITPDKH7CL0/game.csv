"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise - I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you've stated. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $15,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $13,500. Can you consider my revised offer?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with your offer.  $13,500 just doesn't reflect the value of this product.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $14,250. This is my final offer.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,750, but no higher. Can you reconsider?",13750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand we're nearing the end of our negotiation.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is my final offer. If we don't reach an agreement, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers.",14000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $14,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $13,500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10,000.",13500.0,Bob,8,
