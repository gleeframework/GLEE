"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's no way I'll accept that. It's better to reject and start counter-offering to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I understand the product's value, but I'm only able to offer $1,400,000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's still above my maximum budget but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also establishes a negotiation range.  We'll see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a number closer to my initial ask. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, $1,900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm going to continue negotiating to try to get the price down further.  I'm still hopeful that we can reach a deal without resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm again pushing towards a middle ground but staying within my budget. Offering $1,600,000 shows that I'm serious about the deal but also leaves room for further negotiation.  This counteroffer is a reasonable step towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm willing to be flexible. However,  $1,600,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  My final offer is $1,750,000.  This reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's more than fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, $1,750,000 is still a little too high.  I'm not willing to pay that much, especially since I can buy the product from John for $1,200,000.  I'm going to see if I can get Alice to come down further before resorting to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,650,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm  increasing my offer again, showing that I'm still serious about buying the product.  $1,650,000 is a compromise that could be appealing to Alice as she's already lowered her price significantly.  However, it's important to keep in mind that I'm still within my budget and can walk away if this offer is not accepted."
