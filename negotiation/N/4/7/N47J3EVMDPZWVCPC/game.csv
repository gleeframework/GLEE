"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I understand the product's value, but I'm only able to offer $1,400,000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a number closer to my initial ask. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm willing to be flexible. However,  $1,600,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  My final offer is $1,750,000.  This reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's more than fair.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,650,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
