Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** While I'm not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies it's worth a significant amount.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to discussion with ""What do you think?"",  signaling that I'm willing to hear Bob's perspective and potentially negotiate.

**Important Note:**  Even though John offers a guaranteed $15,000, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a more profitable outcome."
