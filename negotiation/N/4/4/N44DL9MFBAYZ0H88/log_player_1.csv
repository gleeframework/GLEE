Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This is a strategic opening offer:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum:**  It gives Bob room to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a good deal, while still being significantly above what you'd get from John.
* **It sets a strong starting point:**  By starting high, you establish a baseline for the negotiation and leave room to come down later.
* **It's clear and concise:**  The message is direct and focused on getting Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. It's a significant discount from your original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range to try and reach a more agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is still above Bob's offer but closer to my minimum:** This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting the value of the product:**  Reminding Bob of the product's worth helps justify my counteroffer. 
* **Focusing on compromise:**  Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""work together"" fosters a collaborative tone and makes the negotiation feel less adversarial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1025000. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase if you accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target.  I'm not willing to settle for a loss just yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to reach a final agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer, but $1,025,000 is still a bit below what I need. I'm prepared to finalize this deal at $1,075,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and our back-and-forth.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** This is a strong signal that I'm serious about closing the deal but won't go any lower.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  Reiterating the value of the product and the negotiations so far strengthens the justification for my offer.
* **Clear next steps:**  The ""final offer"" statement gives Bob a clear understanding of the situation and sets a clear deadline for a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but $1075000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1025000, which is the same price I offered earlier. If you're not willing to accept it, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and he's now explicitly threatening to go to John, who will pay $1,000,000.  While this is less than what I could get from John,  it's clear that Bob is unlikely to budge further.  

It's better to accept John's offer and secure the higher price, even though it's slightly less than my initial target."
