"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1250000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. It's a significant discount from your original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's work together to find a solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1025000. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase if you accept it.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer, but $1025000 is still a bit below what I need. I'm prepared to finalize this deal at $1075000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and our back-and-forth.  This is my final offer.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but $1075000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1025000, which is the same price I offered earlier. If you're not willing to accept it, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1000000.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
