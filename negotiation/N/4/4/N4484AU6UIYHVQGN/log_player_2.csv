"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a price of $110. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  While $110 is less than what he's willing to pay John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to pay $105 for this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $108. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $108, which is within Bob's acceptable range of $120.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal, and the risk of losing the deal to John is higher.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price."
