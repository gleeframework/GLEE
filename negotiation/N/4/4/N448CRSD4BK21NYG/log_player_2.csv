"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations. Considering its value, I propose a price of $15,000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to discuss other terms. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is too high. Bob's goal is to save money, and $15,000 is well above his $12,000 limit. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's value, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
