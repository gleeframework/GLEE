"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset for your business. I'm asking for $1,200,000, a price that reflects its significant value and potential. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,100,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be frank, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $900,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This gives us both a fair deal and allows us to move forward.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,025,000? That's my final offer.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
