"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset for your business. I'm asking for $1,200,000, a price that reflects its significant value and potential. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your ideal price and the product's value to her. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,100,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm happy with. It's time to push back a little harder to see how much she's willing to move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be frank, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $900,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This gives us both a fair deal and allows us to move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting closer, but I'm still aiming for under $1,000,000.  Alice seems to be anchored at that $1,000,000 mark, but there might still be some room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,025,000? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
``` 

Here's why this counter offer makes sense:

* **Showing firmness:** By stating this is your final offer, you signal to Alice you're serious and unlikely to go much higher.
* **Slight concession:** Offering to split the difference shows you're willing to compromise, but still holds the line on your desired price range.
* **Time pressure:** As we approach the later rounds, Alice might be more willing to accept a lower offer to avoid losing the sale altogether."
