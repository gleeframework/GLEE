"I'm excited to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you given its value to you. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,100,000 is still out of reach for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant amount considering my initial budget. Let's try to bridge the gap and finalize the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to go up to $950,000, Bob. However, I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
