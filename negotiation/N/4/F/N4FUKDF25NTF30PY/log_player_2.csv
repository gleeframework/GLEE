"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. While it's a good deal for her, it's not a good deal for you.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you given its value to you. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'm still willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired range."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,100,000 is still out of reach for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant amount considering my initial budget. Let's try to bridge the gap and finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're willing to go up to $950,000, Bob. However, I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. Although she's shown a willingness to compromise, her latest offer is still too high. At this point, it's more beneficial for me to buy the product from John for $800,000, which is within my budget and saves me a significant amount of money compared to Alice's offer."
