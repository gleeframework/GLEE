Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price slightly.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob of its worth, potentially justifying the higher price in his mind.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply Bob might lose out if he doesn't take this offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable."
