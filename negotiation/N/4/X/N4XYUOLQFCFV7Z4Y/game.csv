"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and significantly less than the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be happy to pay $850,000 for the product.  That's still a great deal for you, and it's within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about $1,000,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $900,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you and it's a step closer to my minimum. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and it gets us much closer to closing this deal. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
