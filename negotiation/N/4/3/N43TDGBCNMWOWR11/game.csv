"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $125 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $105?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a mutually beneficial transaction.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I am willing to negotiate further. For your consideration, I propose a price of $115 for the product. I hope this aligns more closely with what you're looking for and we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $115 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to come down to $110? I think this would be a fair price that allows us to both make this deal happen.",110.0,Bob,4,
