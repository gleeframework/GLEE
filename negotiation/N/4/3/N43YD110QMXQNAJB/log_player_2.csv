Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum. To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $1,350,000.  This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident the product will deliver significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
