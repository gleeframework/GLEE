"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $13,000 is too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is only $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me. This product is very valuable, and I'm confident it's worth more to you in the long run. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still out of my price range. I'm firm on $8,000.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at $8,000 and it's unlikely he'll budge significantly.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed $10,000 offer."
