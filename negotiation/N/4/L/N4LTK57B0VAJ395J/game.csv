"Alice,  $13,000 is too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is only $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me. This product is very valuable, and I'm confident it's worth more to you in the long run. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still out of my price range. I'm firm on $8,000.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",8000.0,Bob,4,
