"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm very interested in the product but would like to offer you $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again and offer $11500. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you the product for $12500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further. While I value the product, $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $12000.  This is a final offer from me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,6,
