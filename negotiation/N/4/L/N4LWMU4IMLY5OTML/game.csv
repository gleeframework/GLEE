"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This price would still leave you a good margin for profit, and it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $875,000. This price would give me a bit more wiggle room in my budget, and I'm willing to make it work. Can you consider this offer?",875000.0,Bob,4,
