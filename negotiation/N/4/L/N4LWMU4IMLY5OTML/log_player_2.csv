"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This price would still leave you a good margin for profit, and it's a fair compromise.
