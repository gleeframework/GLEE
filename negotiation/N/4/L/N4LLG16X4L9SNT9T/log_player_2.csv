Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $106 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $108. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is sticking to her price, and while $108 is a little closer, it's still above your maximum. You've got a guaranteed deal with John for $100, which is your limit.  It's time to take the sure thing."
