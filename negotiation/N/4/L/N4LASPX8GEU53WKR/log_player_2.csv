{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is only worth $10,000 to me, I'll reject Alice's offer of $12,000. I can try to negotiate a better price with her or buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
I'm offering Alice $9,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from her initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product is worth $10,000 to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $11,000 is still too high for me. Since John is willing to sell the product for $10,000, I'll go ahead and buy it from him."
