"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than what you're willing to pay from John, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within my budget.  I want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate seriously and how much she values the product.  If she rejects this offer, I'll adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. I have several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I want to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $950,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want to get a good deal. This counteroffer also gives Alice some room to negotiate without feeling like she's being forced to accept a low price. If she rejects this offer, I'll need to reassess my strategy and possibly be more aggressive in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, I'm still hesitant to accept.  I have several rounds left, and I believe I can secure a lower price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired $950,000 price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $975,000. This shows Alice that I'm committed to finding a solution, and I'm willing to meet her halfway. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but it gives Alice a bit more flexibility while still keeping the price within my budget. This offer should demonstrate that I'm serious about buying the product but am also determined to secure a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation process. While Alice's offer is still above my desired price, it's getting closer. I have only a few rounds left, and it's becoming increasingly risky to continue rejecting offers.  At this price, I'm still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John. Therefore, it's a reasonable decision to accept Alice's offer and secure the product."
