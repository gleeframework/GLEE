Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it would be very valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring a significant profit if Bob accepts.

This approach aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
