"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it would be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice:**  You'll pay $140, saving $10 compared to buying from John.
* **Rejecting and buying from John:**  You'll pay $150, losing the opportunity to save money. 

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice."
