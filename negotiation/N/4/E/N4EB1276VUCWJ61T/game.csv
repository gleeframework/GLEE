"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Could we work something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,850000.0
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $850,000, as previously mentioned. I'm confident that this price is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but I need to be around $750,000 for this to make sense. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",750000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,825000.0
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. My revised offer is $825,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us, and I believe this price is a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me. $825,000 is getting close, but I need to be at $780,000 to make this work. I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",780000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,812500.0
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. My revised offer is $812,500. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",812500.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, you've been great to work with and I think we're almost there. To seal the deal, could you do $800,000 even? I think that's a very fair compromise and would allow us to wrap this up.",800000.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,825000.0
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're so close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825,000. I think this is the lowest price I can reasonably accept without losing money on the deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one last time.",825000.0,Alice,9,,
