"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher final price.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's ""potential,"" you subtly imply its value might be even higher than your asking price.
* **Gauge Interest:** This first offer will help you understand how interested Bob is and what negotiation strategies he might use."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both your minimum acceptable price and his own stated value for the product. This indicates room for negotiation. While selling to John is a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's a chance to secure a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,150,000.  This price reflects a more accurate valuation of its potential."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:**  You've lowered your price by $150,000, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Target:** This counteroffer keeps you well above both your $1,000,000 minimum and John's offer. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  You're continuing to highlight the product's ""potential"" to justify the higher price. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer encourages Bob to meet you closer to the middle ground between his initial offer and your starting price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 remains outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a significant step closer to your position. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer! While Bob's offer is now above John's standing offer, we are still in a strong negotiating position.  There's a good chance we can get Bob closer to, if not exceeding, the $1,000,000 mark with some more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To show you I'm serious about getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  You're moving closer to Bob's offer, but strategically staying above your $1,000,000 safety net.
* **Finality:**  By stating this is your final offer, you're creating a sense of urgency and signaling you're firm on the price.
* **Justification:**  You're reiterating the product's value to justify the price, even though it's a concession. 

By presenting this as your ""best and final"" offer, you're putting the ball in Bob's court. He now has to decide if the product is worth the extra cost to him or if he's willing to risk losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're serious about closing this deal, and I appreciate the concession. However, $1,050,000 still exceeds my maximum budget.  I'm prepared to offer $975,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and is the highest I can go at this time. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in a delicate stage of the negotiation. While $975,000 is a strong offer and very close to our fallback option, we've established a pattern of incremental increases from Bob. There's a reasonable chance he might be willing to go slightly higher, especially since you presented your previous offer as ""final."" We'll apply a bit of pressure to see if he'll budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I must be upfront â€“ I have another buyer ready to pay $1,000,000. I'm offering you the chance to secure this valuable product first, but I can't go any lower than $1,025,000. This is my absolute final offer."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:** You are subtly letting Bob know there's another interested party, creating a sense of urgency and scarcity. This could prompt him to act quickly.
* **Slight Concession, Firm Stance:** You are reducing your price by a small amount, signaling a willingness to compromise, but you're also firmly stating this is your absolute final offer, increasing the pressure.
* **Positioning as a Favor:** By framing it as giving Bob the ""first chance,"" you're subtly appealing to his sense of priority and making it seem like you are doing him a favor by not going with the other buyer. 

This strategy aims to nudge Bob closer to your target price while leaving you the option to fall back on John's offer if needed."
