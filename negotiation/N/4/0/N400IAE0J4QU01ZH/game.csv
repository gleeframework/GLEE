,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,150,000.  This price reflects a more accurate valuation of its potential.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 remains outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a significant step closer to your position. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To show you I'm serious about getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price for a product of this caliber.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're serious about closing this deal, and I appreciate the concession. However, $1,050,000 still exceeds my maximum budget.  I'm prepared to offer $975,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and is the highest I can go at this time. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I must be upfront â€“ I have another buyer ready to pay $1,000,000. I'm offering you the chance to secure this valuable product first, but I can't go any lower than $1,025,000. This is my absolute final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
