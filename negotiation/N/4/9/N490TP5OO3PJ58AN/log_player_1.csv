```

I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will be interested as he values the product at $1,200,000.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,150,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000}
```

I'm countering with $1,225,000. This is a compromise that's closer to my initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see this as a more reasonable price given his own valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to go much lower than $1,200,000. To avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with an even lower price, I'm going to sell the product to John. I know I can get my minimum from him."
