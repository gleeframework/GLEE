"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $150 is a bit steep for me. How about $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our original offer. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? That way we both get a fair deal.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $128. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",128.0,Alice,5,
