"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your budget:**  You're only willing to spend $10,000.
* **There's a better alternative:** John is offering the product for your desired price.  
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:** By rejecting, you can try to get a lower price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget:** You're still only willing to spend $10,000.
* **You have a guaranteed alternative:** John is offering the product for your desired price.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to be successful:** Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise, and you've made your bottom line clear.  It's improbable she'll go lower than $11,000. 

It's better to secure the product from John at your target price than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up paying more."
