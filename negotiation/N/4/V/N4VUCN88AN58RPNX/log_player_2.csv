"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, but I'm willing to be transparent about the fact that I have another buyer interested in purchasing it for $1000000. That being said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you may be higher or lower than this amount. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
