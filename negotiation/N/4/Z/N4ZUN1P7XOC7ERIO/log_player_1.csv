"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm willing to explore his counteroffers."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to compromise, but  $1,600,000 is the lowest I can go.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1450000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is inching closer to my minimum,  $1,450,000 is still below the value I have for the product. I will reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but  $1,450,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,525,000? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1525000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,480,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I want to push for a better deal and see if Bob is willing to go higher.  I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum. I've tried my best to negotiate a price that works for both of us, but it seems we're at an impasse.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This ensures I achieve my desired price and avoid further negotiation."
