"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is incredibly close to Bob's maximum price. It's only $1 less than what Bob is willing to pay from John.  There's little to gain by rejecting the offer and risking a counteroffer from Alice that could be higher.  Accepting saves Bob $1."
