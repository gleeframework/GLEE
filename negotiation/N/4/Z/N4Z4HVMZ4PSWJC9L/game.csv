"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 right now. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While I'm still interested, $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $11,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. It's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than $11,000 to make this deal worth it for me. I'm now offering the product to you for $12,500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",12500.0,Alice,5,
