Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to make this a win-win situation.  I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for the highest possible price is ideal, but it's crucial to stay realistic to avoid losing the sale.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering a price significantly lower than this risks insulting him and could lead to him questioning the product's value. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high allows room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can then settle on a price that's still highly profitable. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While we have John as a backup, selling to Bob at a higher price is always preferable.

This strategy balances profit maximization with a good chance of closing the deal with Bob."
