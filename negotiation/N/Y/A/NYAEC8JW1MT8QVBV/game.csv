"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value it brings and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'd be willing to meet you at $950,000. That's the highest I'm comfortable going. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but that price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product and what it can do for you.  I'm confident that at $1,000,000, this will be a win-win for both of us.  This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,000,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. That's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider it?",925000.0,Bob,6,
