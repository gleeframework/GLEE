"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its potential. I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I see the value you place on the product at $850,000, I believe its potential warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. This offer reflects the true value of what this product brings to the table.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $920,000 is still above my current target.  I'm willing to offer $880,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm keen on finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This represents a significant concession on my end while still reflecting the true value of this product.",900000.0,Alice,5,
