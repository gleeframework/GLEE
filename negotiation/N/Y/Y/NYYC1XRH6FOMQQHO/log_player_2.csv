"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its potential. I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I see the value you place on the product at $850,000, I believe its potential warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. This offer reflects the true value of what this product brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly,  $920,000 is still too high. You can likely get a better price with further negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $920,000 is still above my current target.  I'm willing to offer $880,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm keen on finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This represents a significant concession on my end while still reflecting the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000. While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that she won't budge much more. Accepting this offer gives you the product at a price significantly lower than what John is offering, and it's within your budget.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice might walk away or hold firm at her price, leaving you with no deal and needing to buy from John.  It's a good time to close the deal."
