{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming slightly below Bob's valuation leaves room for negotiation but ensures we capture a significant portion of the value (a $300,000 profit).
* **Backup Option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so we don't want to go below that.

**The offer is structured to be attractive to Bob while still securing a substantial profit for Alice.**"
