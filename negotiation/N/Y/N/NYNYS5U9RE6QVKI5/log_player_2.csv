"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible and has a clear alternative with John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows Bob's serious intention to buy the product, but also signals his budget constraints.  This counteroffer is also lower than the price he could get from John, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget.  While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still not in the range Bob is comfortable with. He has John as a backup and wants to explore further negotiation to see if he can reach a more desirable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate. However, he's still staying below his threshold and is clearly pushing Alice closer to his target.  This counteroffer is still lower than John's price, so Bob still has room to maneuver."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob, even though it's lower than her previous offer.  Bob wants to continue negotiating to try and get a price closer to his budget. He can still buy from John, so there's no immediate need to accept an offer that isn't ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway. However, he's still remaining below his budget limit, making it clear that he's aiming for a deal that works for him financially. The counteroffer is also strategically placed, leaving room for further negotiation without exceeding his maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is stuck at a price that Bob considers too high.  While the negotiation has brought the price down somewhat, it's not getting close enough to Bob's desired price point.  Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John, and the rounds are getting limited, he's choosing to cut his losses and secure the product for a lower price with John."
