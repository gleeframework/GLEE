"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, however,  $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be frank, $800,000 is the absolute lowest I can go and still make this deal worthwhile for both of us. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
