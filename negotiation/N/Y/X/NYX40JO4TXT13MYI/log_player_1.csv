"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This is a negotiation tactic to establish a starting point and see how willing Bob is to pay.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation, so I don't immediately risk losing the deal by being too aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000.  I believe there's room for negotiation and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's last offer.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us, hoping to close the deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my desired price and represents a good deal.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, I'm not sure if there's enough room for further negotiation. There's a risk of losing the deal completely if I keep rejecting offers, and I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from John. It's time to secure the deal."
