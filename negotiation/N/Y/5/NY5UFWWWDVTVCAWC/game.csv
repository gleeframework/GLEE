"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider reducing the price to $1,300,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, the product's value is firmly above that mark. Could you consider $1,900,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my initial offer while acknowledging the product's inherent worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've given this careful consideration. I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, my budget cannot accommodate $1,900,000. Would you be willing to lower the price to $1,400,000? This still represents a substantial discount from your initial proposal, and I believe it would be a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
