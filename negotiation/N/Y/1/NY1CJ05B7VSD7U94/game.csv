,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make a slightly better offer to you. I'll give you a deal for $102. It's a compromise between our previous offers, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $102 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $98 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $98. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll give you a deal for $101. It's a slight adjustment from our previous offers, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",101.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $101 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $99 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",99.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $99. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll give you a deal for $100.50. It's a slight adjustment from our previous offers, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",100.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, which is $100. I'd be happy to accept the product at this price. Can you meet me at this price?",100.0,Bob,10,
