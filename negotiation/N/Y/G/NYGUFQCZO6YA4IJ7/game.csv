"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product at a price that reflects its value. I understand you're interested, so I'm offering it for $900,000. This is a significant discount for a product worth over a million to me, and I'm confident it will be a lucrative investment for you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. This offer represents a fair price considering my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $700,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, but still allows you to acquire a product of substantial value.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth.  Let's try to find common ground and make this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant compromise for me, but I still believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? This would give us both a good deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
