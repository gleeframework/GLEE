Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, but still ensures I get a great price.
* **Create Urgency:**  By stating it's a ""steal"" and a ""great deal,"" I'm subtly implying this offer is time-sensitive, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
