"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely negotiate a better price with Alice. There are still 9 rounds left, giving Bob ample opportunity to try and get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're highlighting in the product. However,  $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Bob is starting with a relatively low counteroffer, aiming to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:** He provides a reason for his counteroffer (""higher than I'm comfortable with""), which helps frame the negotiation as a reasonable discussion rather than a hard stance. 
* **Middle Ground:** The counteroffer of $10,500 is a middle ground between Bob's ideal price and Alice's initial offer, creating a basis for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:** Bob is still within his budget and has a strong incentive to continue negotiating. 
* **Potential for Lower Price:**  While $11,000 is a good price, Alice has already shown a willingness to come down from her original offer. There's still potential to push for a lower price. 
* **Rounds Remaining:**  With 7 rounds left, Bob has time to negotiate further and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,750.  This feels like a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** This tactic is often effective in negotiations as it shows a willingness to compromise and move toward a middle ground. 
* **Continuing to Negotiate:**  Bob is still offering a price that's within his budget, demonstrating his interest in the product while pushing for a more favorable price. 
* **Small Increments:** The offer is a small increment above Bob's previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to move but not giving away too much."
