"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $12,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $12,000 is quite high. I'm interested, but only if you're willing to come down significantly on the price.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm on a tight budget and $9,000 is still a bit out of reach. How about we settle at $7,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding.  $8,500 is close, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $8,000.  Would you consider $7,500? That's a significant move on my part, and I think it would be a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really trying to get close to your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,500, which is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find this product valuable, and I think $8,000 is a fair price for both of us. Let's seal the deal!",8000.0,Alice,7,
