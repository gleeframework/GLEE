"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that maximizes my potential profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm assuming he might be willing to pay a premium for this product. This also leaves room for negotiation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my target of $1,000,000.  I'm still early in the negotiation process, and rejecting this offer allows me to continue exploring other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $920,000 is a good deal.  We're nearing the middle of the negotiation process, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to haggle.  It's a significant profit for me, and I'm happy to close the deal."
