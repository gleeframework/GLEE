Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for negotiation, but still gives him a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still significantly above your minimum selling price, giving you some wiggle room.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  You're stating your price and encouraging a response. 

Keep in mind: This is just the first step in the negotiation. You'll need to be flexible and willing to adjust your price based on Bob's responses. Also, remember you can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $800,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $1,000,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 just doesn't work for me. It's significantly below what the product is worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
``` 
 
This counteroffer aims to:

* **Be reasonable:**  It's a compromise, moving halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Maintain your value:** It's still above your minimum selling price of $1,000,000.
* **Show flexibility:**  You're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy keeps the negotiations moving while still protecting your interests."
