Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000 vs. $1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make a subsequent counter-offer seem more reasonable.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""immense value"" and ""true worth,"" the message subtly justifies the high price, even without explicitly stating what those benefits are.
* **Exclusivity:** Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a layer of desirability. 
* **Fallback Option:** Even if Bob rejects this initial high offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John at $1,000,000, ensuring she doesn't lose out. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit by testing Bob's willingness to pay a premium."
