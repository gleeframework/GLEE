"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for improvement.**  You want to save as much money as possible, and there's a chance you can get a lower price. 
* **You have 10 rounds.**  There's no rush to make a decision. 
* **John's offer is a fallback option.** You know you can always get the product for $8,000, so you have some negotiating leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your desire to negotiate. However, it's still within a reasonable range, leaving room for potential compromise.
* **Testing the waters:** This allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially find a middle ground.
* **Maintaining leverage:** You still have the option to buy from John, so you're not putting yourself in a desperate position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving closer to your desired price.** The price has dropped to $7,200, which is significantly closer to your target than her initial offer.
* **You have already shown your bargaining power.** By rejecting your previous counteroffer, Alice has shown that she is willing to negotiate. 
* **There's no guarantee of a better offer.** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or even an increase in the price.  
* **John's offer provides a safety net.** If you don't like the final outcome, you can always purchase from John. 

By accepting the offer, you save $800 compared to buying from John. This is a good outcome given the limited number of rounds and the possibility of Alice becoming more stubborn."
