"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've described. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective, $1400000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1700000. This reflects the significant value and potential the product offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, and I appreciate the willingness to come down from your initial price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $1700000 price tag. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1500000. Can we discuss the potential value of the product and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
