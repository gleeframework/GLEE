"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This reflects a fair price considering market value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product is truly exceptional and holds substantial value. Let's aim for a price that reflects its worth. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  My counteroffer is $1,600,000. This price is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while remaining realistic.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000. I believe this represents a significant step towards a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but we still have some ground to cover. I understand you have a budget, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a unique opportunity that will benefit your business greatly. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and make this a win-win situation.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
