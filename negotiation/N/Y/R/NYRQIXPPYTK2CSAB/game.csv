"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $80. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $100 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115, which is a good compromise. Let's close this deal. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,5,
