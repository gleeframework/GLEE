{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it will be immensely valuable to you.  To kick off negotiations, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $750,000 is significantly below my bottom line for this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  Would you consider $875,000?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for you, Alice. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you consider $825,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $825,000 is a strong deal. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further negotiation rounds potentially lowering the final price."
