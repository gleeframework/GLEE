Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique features and market value, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the baseline:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000. This is your ""walk-away"" point â€“ you should never sell for less.
* **Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Your goal is to get as close to your $1,500,000 valuation as possible, knowing Bob likely won't go above his own.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with an offer of $1,300,000 gives you room to negotiate.  While it's above Bob's valuation, it positions the product as high-value.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique features"" and ""market value"" reinforces the price justification without revealing specific details about your other buyer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter your offer. Having a negotiation strategy in mind will be crucial. 
* **Alternatives:** Bob might try to leverage your position, knowing you have another buyer.  Stay firm on the value you place on the product."
