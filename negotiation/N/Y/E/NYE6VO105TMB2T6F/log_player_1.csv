Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Its value to both of us is undeniable.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Given its worth, I believe this is a fair offer that allows us both to benefit significantly."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high offer of $1,500,000 sets a strong anchor point for the negotiation.  Even if Bob rejects it, it frames the discussion at a higher value.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to both parties helps justify the high asking price.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential reward of selling it for $500,000 more than your guaranteed price makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
