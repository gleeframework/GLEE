"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $8,500 is closer, it's still a little out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $8,250. This is my final offer, so let me know what you think.",8250.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'll meet you at $8,500 was a good compromise, but I can go to $8,300. This is my final offer, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",8300.0,Alice,5,
