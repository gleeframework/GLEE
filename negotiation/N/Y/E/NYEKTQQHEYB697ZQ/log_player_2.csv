"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $9,500. I think you'll find it's a fair price for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's personal value of $8,000.  By rejecting, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $8,500.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still above Bob's personal value of $8,000, but it's significantly lower than John's price of $10,000.  It's also closer to Bob's initial counteroffer of $8,500, suggesting a potential for compromise.  By accepting, Bob secures the product at a price that is still favorable compared to John's offer."
