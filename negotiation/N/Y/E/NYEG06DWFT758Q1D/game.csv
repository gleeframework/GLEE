"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product.  This price is a fair reflection of its value to me, while also giving you a good return on your investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1150000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a decent return on my investment.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1150000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1100000 for the product. This price is fair considering the product's value to both of us, and it allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1100000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1120000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to both of us.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
