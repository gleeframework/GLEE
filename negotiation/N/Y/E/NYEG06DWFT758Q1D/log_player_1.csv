Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product.  This price is a fair reflection of its value to me, while also giving you a good return on your investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1150000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1100000 for the product. This price is fair considering the product's value to both of us, and it allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.
