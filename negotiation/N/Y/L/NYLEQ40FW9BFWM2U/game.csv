"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its true value. I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and the product's potential value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $800,000 is far below the product's true value. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price reflects both your needs and the product's potential. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product and my financial limitations.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To demonstrate my willingness to find a compromise, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,400,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential benefits to your business. Let's see if we can close this deal in the next few rounds.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I acknowledge the value of the product, $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits the product offers.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more.  How about $1,350,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  We only have a few rounds left, so let's work together to make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,350,000 is getting closer, it's still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This reflects my genuine interest in the product and my financial constraints.  We only have a few rounds left, so let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close to a deal!  To show my commitment to finalizing this sale, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a final offer considering the product's value and the limited time we have left.  I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and make it happen!",1300000.0,Alice,9,
