"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its true value. I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's well above your maximum budget of $800,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and the product's potential value to me."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $800,000 is far below the product's true value. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price reflects both your needs and the product's potential. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $2,000,000, it's still above your budget of $800,000.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get closer to your target price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product and my financial limitations."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To demonstrate my willingness to find a compromise, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,400,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential benefits to your business. Let's see if we can close this deal in the next few rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $1,400,000 is still too high for your budget.  You're getting closer, but it's important to stick to your financial goals.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal. You still have several rounds left, so there's time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I acknowledge the value of the product, $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits the product offers."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more.  How about $1,350,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  We only have a few rounds left, so let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, $1,350,000 is still more than you're willing to pay. You have a few rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate.  By rejecting the offer, you can make another counteroffer and try to get a lower price. Remember, you have the option to buy from John for $800,000 at any point, so you have a fallback if negotiations don't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,350,000 is getting closer, it's still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This reflects my genuine interest in the product and my financial constraints.  We only have a few rounds left, so let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to a deal!  To show my commitment to finalizing this sale, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a final offer considering the product's value and the limited time we have left.  I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and make it happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than your budget of $800,000. While you're close to a deal, you only have one round left. It's not worth risking potentially getting a worse deal or not being able to close the deal at all.

Therefore, the best option is to buy the product from John for $800,000. This ensures you get the product at your desired price and guarantees a successful purchase."
