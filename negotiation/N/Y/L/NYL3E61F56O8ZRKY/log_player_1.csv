Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your minimum price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Fallback Option:** Remember, you always have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80, so there's no risk of losing out completely if Bob rejects your initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both your minimum price ($80) and his own stated value for the product ($80). This suggests he's trying to negotiate a bargain deal. Rejecting this low offer allows you to:

* **Demonstrate Value:** Show Bob that you're not desperate to sell at any price and that you believe the product is worth more.
* **Guide Negotiation Upwards:** Encourage Bob to make a more reasonable counteroffer closer to the actual value of the product. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  You still have John as a backup buyer at $80, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product is worth a lot to you, as you know.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Appearance):**  By suggesting $100, you're *appearing* to move closer to the middle ground. This can be a persuasive negotiation tactic.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  Importantly, $100 keeps you well above your minimum acceptable price of $80, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Testing Bob's Seriousness:** This counteroffer gauges how serious Bob is about purchasing. If he's truly interested, he'll likely counter again. If he's just trying his luck with lowball offers, he might walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget in mind. How about $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is slightly below your ideal price, it's important to consider:

* **Profitable Deal:**  $75 is still a profitable sale, exceeding your minimum by $5.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Negotiations can be tiring. Accepting a reasonable offer now avoids further back-and-forth.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him walking away. Accepting ensures a sale and allows you to move on to other potential deals.

It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and holding out for a small potential gain might not be worth the risk of losing him as a customer."
