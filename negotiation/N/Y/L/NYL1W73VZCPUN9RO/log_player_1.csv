Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum acceptable value ($100) but lower than what you know the product is worth to Bob ($150). This leaves room for a negotiation but also allows you to secure a profit if Bob accepts immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $150. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I am proposing $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is higher than the $100 you could get from John, it's still lower than your desired profit margin. You can likely get closer to your target by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $120 for the product, which still leaves a little room for both of us to benefit.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
