Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I believe it's important to start high and see how much Bob is willing to pay.  If he's willing to meet me in the middle, I'll still be satisfied. If not, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a good price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my value.  I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm confident that I can't get a significantly better offer from him. It's a good deal for me, and I'd rather secure the sale than risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on this opportunity."
