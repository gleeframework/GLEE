"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'll meet you at $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we meet at $98? I think that's the best I can do.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $98. I'll meet you halfway between $105 and $98, which would be $101.50. What do you think?",101.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the price at $101.50. I'm willing to meet you at $99, but that's as low as I can go. I really want to make a deal with you, Alice.",99.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $99. I'll make one more offer: I'll meet you at $102.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Alice, but I think we've been negotiating for a while and I'm not willing to go any higher than $100. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at that price. I'd rather buy it from John for $100.",100.0,Bob,10,
