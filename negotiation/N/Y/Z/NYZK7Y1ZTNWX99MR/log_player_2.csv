{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, so he's offering the maximum price he's willing to pay.  This is a strong opening counteroffer that establishes a clear starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even lower price. There's a good chance Alice might be willing to come down further, especially since Bob has already shown a willingness to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible.  He's increasing his offer slightly from his initial counteroffer, showing that he's willing to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer, making it a reasonable counteroffer that might entice Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is only $80,000 above Bob's maximum price. This is a relatively small difference, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield much more savings.  It's a good deal for Bob considering his other option is to buy from John for $1,000,000."
