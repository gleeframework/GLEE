This is a much higher price than you're willing to pay.  It's better to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my value for it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still significantly above your offer but closer to a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

While $1,300,000 is closer to your budget, you're still aiming for a lower price. You can likely negotiate further.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue the negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both assign to the product. Let's try to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  How about $1,200,000? This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair price considering your value for the product.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
