Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my value for it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and I believe there's room to negotiate a more favorable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still significantly above your offer but closer to a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both assign to the product. Let's try to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
