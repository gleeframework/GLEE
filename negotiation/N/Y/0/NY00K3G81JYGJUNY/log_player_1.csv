"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a better outcome. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,000,000, we establish a high anchor point, influencing Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving space for negotiation over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant amount, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  You know John is willing to pay the full amount.  Therefore, it's in your best interest to continue negotiating with Bob for now.  There's a chance to secure a price closer to your target before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. It's clear we both see the value in this product. To be fair to both sides, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  A significant decrease from $2,000,000 to $1,850,000 signals willingness to negotiate but remains firmly above the $1,500,000 backup offer.
* **Justification:** Framing the price as ""fair to both sides"" emphasizes finding a win-win solution, not just maximizing profit.
* **Time Constraint:** With seven rounds remaining, there's still time for Bob to counter, but moving closer to your minimum acceptable price creates urgency.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation active while pushing towards a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting further away from our minimum acceptable price. It's clear that his valuation is significantly lower than ours. We still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so there's no need to settle for less. We'll make one more counteroffer to gauge his willingness to move, but be prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I have to be honest,  $1,300,000 is simply too far from where this deal makes sense for me. I'm willing to make one more move as a final offer: $1,600,000.  This is my bottom line, and I believe it's a very reasonable price considering the value you're receiving.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  The message clearly states this is a ""final offer"" and your ""bottom line,"" creating a sense of urgency and seriousness.
* **Slight Concession:** Coming down to $1,600,000 shows flexibility but maintains a price well above your guaranteed option with John.
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the product's value reminds Bob of what's at stake if he declines.

This counteroffer aims to either secure a price significantly closer to your target or prompt you to walk away and accept John's offer in the next round if Bob doesn't budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to think about alternative options. I'm not sure if I can go any higher than this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer remains at $1,400,000, despite your ""final offer"" of $1,600,000.  Crucially, he mentions considering ""alternative options"" and uncertainty about going higher. This strongly suggests he's unlikely to meet your minimum price. 

Given this, further negotiation likely carries more risk than potential reward. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000, ensuring a profitable outcome.  It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure the sure thing."
