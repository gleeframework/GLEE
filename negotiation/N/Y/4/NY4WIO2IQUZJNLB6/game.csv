"Alice, while I appreciate your offer and see the potential in this product, $1800000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, given my understanding of its value and the potential for growth. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1000000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise to find a solution that benefits both of us. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1500000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable margin for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1500000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of this product. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
