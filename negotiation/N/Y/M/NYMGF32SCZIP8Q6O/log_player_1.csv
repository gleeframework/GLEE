Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, and I'm excited about its potential. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering my budget and the value I'm looking to get out of the product.

Bob is clearly very interested and is now trying to anchor the price at $1,050,000.  We need to show firmness but also a willingness to make a small concession to get the deal done."

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. I'm ready to close this deal today. Let's agree on $1,070,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us considering the immense value you're gaining."",
""product_price"": 1070000

``` 

We're giving a final offer here.  It's a strong move that signals the end of negotiation while still offering Bob a price significantly above John's. This hopefully motivates him to accept and avoids dragging the negotiation further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your eagerness to close the deal, Alice, but I'm still a bit off from $1,070,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,055,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

While we were aiming for $1,070,000, Bob countered with a ""final offer"" that's still a significant gain over John's $1,000,000. Accepting now secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in the final rounds."
