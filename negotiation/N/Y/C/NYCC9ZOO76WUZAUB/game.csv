"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a price closer to what I need.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. How about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to a final compromise. How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a sale.  Let's make this happen.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. Is that something you'd consider?",100.0,Bob,6,
