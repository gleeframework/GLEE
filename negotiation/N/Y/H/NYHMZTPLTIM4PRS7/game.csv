"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1400000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I'm still very interested in purchasing the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1380000 is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1380000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above the budget I was thinking of. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1320000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1500000, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1320000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1320000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $1350000 is the lowest I can go. This is already below my initial asking price, and I'm starting to get concerned that I'll miss out on a better opportunity. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1325000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1325000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $1370000 is the absolute minimum I can accept. This is already a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I'm starting to feel like I'm leaving money on the table. What do you think?",1370000.0,Alice,7,
