"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",7500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $7,500 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $7,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,750. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $7,200. This is the lowest I can go without sacrificing my profit margin. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7200.0,Alice,5,
