Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob's offer:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price of $1,500,000. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, making it the most logical decision at this point."
