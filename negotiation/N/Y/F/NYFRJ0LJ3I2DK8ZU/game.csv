"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get it at a price below its value to you, and I get a good price for it. This is a one-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1,500,000. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
