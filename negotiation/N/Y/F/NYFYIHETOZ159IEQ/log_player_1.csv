"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows for room to negotiate. I believe this will pique Bob's interest without scaring him off completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, this will encourage him to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, but $1,100,000 is still not enough. I'll reject his offer and try to get a higher counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,250,000. This is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  I'm showing flexibility, and hopefully, Bob will recognize that he's getting a good deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,150,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,200,000, my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident Bob will accept this offer as it's a good deal for him and he's already shown a willingness to move closer to my price. If he rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John at this price, so I'm not taking any further risks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm very close to a deal with Bob, I don't want to risk it.  He's shown a stubborn streak, and I'm not confident he'll come up to my minimum price.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than to risk losing out on a sale altogether."
