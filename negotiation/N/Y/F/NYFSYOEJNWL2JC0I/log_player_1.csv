Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer the product at $120 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance to earn a higher profit by selling to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 is a price that's still very close to your minimum acceptable price but might be tempting enough for Bob to accept. It represents a small ""win"" for him compared to his perceived value of $100.
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
