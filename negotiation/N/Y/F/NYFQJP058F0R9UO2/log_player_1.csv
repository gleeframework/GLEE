Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is above Bob's perceived value of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price of $120, I believe I can still get closer to that by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counteroffering with $100. It's a compromise from my initial offer of $110, but still above Bob's offer of $90. It keeps the negotiation moving while also aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my goal.  Given the risk of further negotiation, I'll sell to John for $120. This guarantees me my minimum and avoids the possibility of ending up with a price lower than I'd like."
