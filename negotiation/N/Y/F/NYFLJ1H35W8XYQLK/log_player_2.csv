"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,250,000?  That's still a great value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $1,150,000? That's a significant jump on my end, and shows I'm serious about making a deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to secure this valuable product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice has met John's price.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate or going with John since the price is the same."
