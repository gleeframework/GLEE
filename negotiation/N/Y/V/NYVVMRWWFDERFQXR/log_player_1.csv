"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for potential negotiation and leaves room for me to lower the price if necessary. It also gives Bob a clear indication of the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $950,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price that still leaves room for further negotiation. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate while also pushing for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping to get closer to $950,000, $920,000 is a good price that exceeds my minimum requirement of $800,000.  It's important to balance the desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
