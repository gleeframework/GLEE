"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $108? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",108.0,Bob,4,
