"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $800,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get her closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While it's definitely intriguing, I'm not quite ready to commit to $700,000.  I'm thinking closer to $650,000 would be a good starting point for us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get the price as low as possible without jeopardizing the deal.  My goal is to get Alice to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still very confident in the product's value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $675,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value is $800,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, I'm still hoping to get it lower.  I'm going to reject her offer and see if I can push her down to $650,000. I'm not willing to pay more than that at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $675,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle on $662,500?  I think that's a fair and reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 662500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a counteroffer that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and meet her halfway, but I'm still pushing for a lower price.  I'm hoping that she'll see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $680,000. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, though. I'll meet you at $670,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $670,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $670,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer considerably, and her offer is getting closer to my target price.  At this point, I'm concerned that if I continue to push for a lower price, Alice may get frustrated and walk away from the deal.  It's possible that I might not be able to get a better deal from John if I reject Alice's offer.  Therefore, I'm going to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for $670,000."
