"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $12,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum valuation. It makes sense to reject and negotiate down, or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  I believe that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in negotiation.  It leaves room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below your $8,000 maximum.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is respectful of Alice's position while clearly stating your price limit. 
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out the $6,000 figure, you're attempting to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to your desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** $10,500 is still significantly above your $8,000 maximum. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic to try and pressure you.  Don't let it sway you, you have a good alternative with John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a chance Alice might be willing to negotiate further, even though she's stated this is her ""final offer."""
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I could go up to $7,000, but that's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** You're acknowledging Alice's movement while standing firm on your budget.
* **""Highest I Can Go"" Tactic:** This creates a sense of urgency and finality, even if it's not entirely true.
* **Strategic Increase:**  The increase to $7,000 shows you're willing to negotiate, but you're still leaving room to meet in the middle if Alice is willing."
