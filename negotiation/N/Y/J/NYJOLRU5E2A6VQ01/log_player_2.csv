"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its worth, I'm offering it at $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget.  It's much better to reject and see if you can get a better price from Alice or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to go up to $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is quite high. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your target price.  You still have several rounds left, and you can always buy from John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay under $11,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product.  Let's make this happen. How about $12,500? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your price range, but $12,500 is still above your budget. You have a few rounds left and John is always an option.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice said this is her ""final offer."""
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay at $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can find a compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
