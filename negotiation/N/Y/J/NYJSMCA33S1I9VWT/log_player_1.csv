Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a high offer, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It also gives Bob a good deal, considering he values the product at $1,500,000.  I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm reducing my price by $100,000 to show that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on earning a profit higher than $800,000.  This price is still attractive for Bob, and hopefully, he will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial offer, $950,000 is still significantly more than what John is offering.  It's a good deal, and I'm happy to close the sale."
