"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a decent price, Bob can still potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for a counteroffer that might be more appealing to both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $120 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $140, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit ($120 is greater than her $100 valuation). This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is a good deal for Bob. It's still within his budget of $150 and significantly better than buying from John.  There's not much room for further negotiation to get a lower price, and the risk of rejecting the offer and having Alice reject any further counteroffers could lead to buying from John at a higher price."
