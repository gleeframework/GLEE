{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $9,500 is above your $8,000 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob knows the product is worth $10,000 to him, so there's potential for him to counteroffer, allowing you to potentially reach a higher price. 
* **It shows you're serious:**  You're not giving away the product for a low price, showing you value the product and expect fair compensation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, I am looking to stay within my budget of $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation.  It's likely that Bob is willing to pay more than $8,000, especially considering he initially rejected your $9,500 offer. 

By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Maintain leverage:** This shows Bob that you're not desperate to sell at his price. 
* **Potentially get a higher price:** A counteroffer from you could lead to a price closer to your ideal value.
* **Test the waters:** You can gauge Bob's true willingness to pay. 

By continuing to negotiate, you have a better chance of earning more than the $8,000 minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a little further to $8,500 to make this work. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Reasonable Price:** $8,500 is a reasonable middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Empathy:** The message acknowledges Bob's budget constraints, demonstrating understanding. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Increase the chances of a deal:** By bridging the gap, this offer makes it more likely for Bob to accept.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting his initial offer, you demonstrate that you're not under pressure to sell at his price.
* **Maximize potential profit:** While $8,500 is not your ideal price, it's still better than the minimum and potentially closer to Bob's true valuation."
