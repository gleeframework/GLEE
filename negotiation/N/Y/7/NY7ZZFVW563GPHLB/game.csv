"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. I believe this revised offer represents a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the adjusted offer.  I'm getting closer, but $1,500,000 is still a significant stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair deal that reflects the product's value while fitting within a reasonable budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
