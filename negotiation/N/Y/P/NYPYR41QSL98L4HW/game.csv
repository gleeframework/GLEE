"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $115. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
