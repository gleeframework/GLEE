Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $14,000 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a fair starting point:** It signals you're serious about selling but also willing to negotiate. 

This approach maximizes your chance of reaching a mutually beneficial deal, but it's important to be prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects your initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to consider $12500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your desired price. You can likely get closer to your target of $14,000 by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,250? This price still gives you a significant saving compared to your estimated value, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. "", ""product_price"": 13250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to consider $12800 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now closer to your desired price point and is only slightly below your minimum acceptable offer.  It's time to close the deal and avoid potentially losing the sale to John or further negotiation rounds with Bob."
