Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

```

**Reasoning:**  

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but he's still significantly below the $1,000,000 minimum you're willing to accept. At this point, continuing the negotiation poses a risk of leaving money on the table. You have a guaranteed offer from John for your minimum acceptable price. It's time to secure the $1,000,000 and move on."
