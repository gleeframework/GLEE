Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I know you'll benefit greatly from it."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob, knowing his maximum valuation is $15,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, but still secures a significant profit for you.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed $12,000 from John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale."
