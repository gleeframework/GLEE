Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price, leaving room for potential compromise. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, Alice provides a subtle justification for the higher price without revealing her minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning listing the product publicly, Alice subtly implies there might be other interested buyers, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While aiming high, the message still invites Bob's thoughts, opening the door for negotiation if he finds the price too steep."
