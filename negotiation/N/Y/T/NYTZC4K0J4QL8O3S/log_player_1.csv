{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product at $9,500, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** By starting at $9,500, I'm allowing Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's losing the negotiation. 
* **Maintaining my minimum:** The offer is still above my minimum price of $10,000. This ensures I don't end up selling it for less than I'm comfortable with.

This strategy allows for a back-and-forth negotiation with Bob while still keeping the price within my desired range. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or decide to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying firm on my desired price:**  Bob's offer is still below my desired minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept an offer that is less than $9,500.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and continue the negotiation. I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob.
* **Maintaining option to sell to John:** I can always choose to sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage in the negotiation and keep the possibility of a more favorable deal open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $9,250 is still above my desired minimum price of $9,500.
* **Maintaining pressure:** The message emphasizes that this is a fair price, putting the onus on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both parties while keeping the negotiation within my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. I'm glad we're finding common ground here. I would like to counter with an offer of $9,100. This seems like a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below my desired minimum price of $9,500.
* **Further negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintaining option to sell to John:** I'm comfortable walking away from the deal if I don't get a price I'm happy with.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation process, potentially get closer to my desired price, and still have the option to sell to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer, but $9,100 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $9,150?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway (again):** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($9,250) and Bob's counteroffer ($9,100). This shows continued willingness to compromise.
* **Close to my minimum:**  $9,150 is very close to my minimum desired price of $9,500, but still allows for a potential deal with Bob.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I highlight that this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, increasing the chances of acceptance.

This counteroffer is a final attempt to bridge the gap with Bob, while still holding onto a price that's closer to my desired minimum. If he rejects, I'm ready to move on and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've been considering the value of the product and I believe a fair price would be $9,125. This offer takes into account both our positions and I hope it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,125 is very close to my minimum desired price of $9,500. 
* **Potential for future negotiation:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's likely that further negotiation with Bob would only yield a few dollars more.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he'll walk away, and I might end up selling to John for a lower price than I'd like. 

Given the proximity to my minimum price and the risk of losing the deal entirely, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best course of action."
