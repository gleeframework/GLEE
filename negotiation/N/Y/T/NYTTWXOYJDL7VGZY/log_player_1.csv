Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could sell to John for $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $1,150,000 is:
    * Above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), leaving room for negotiation.
    * Below my guaranteed sale price ($1,200,000), ensuring I still profit if Bob accepts.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and a 24-hour limit might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Negotiation is complex, and the best approach can change depending on Bob's personality and negotiating style."
