Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be very valuable to you. How does $125 sound?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $100 (John), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Offering it at $125 allows you to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial price, there's room to negotiate down towards his $100 valuation."
