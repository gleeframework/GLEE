"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see some flexibility from your end as well.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident in the significant value this product offers. While $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's true worth and potential return on investment for you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value and my budget. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
