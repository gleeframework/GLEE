"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  That's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my commitment to making this deal work.  Let me know what you think!",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $15,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your offers.  However, $15,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $15,750?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",15750.0,Bob,6,
