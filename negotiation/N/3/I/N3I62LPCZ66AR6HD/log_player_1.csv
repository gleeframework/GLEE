Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your offers.  However, $15,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $15,750?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $15,750 is closer to my desired price point and it's getting late in the negotiation.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing the deal altogether."
