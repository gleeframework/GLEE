,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $20000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to spend.  I'm prepared to offer $8000 for it, which is my maximum budget. Let me know your thoughts.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is significantly below what I need to sell the product. I'm willing to come down to $17000, which is still a great deal considering the unique value this product holds. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $17000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me, and it's the absolute maximum I can offer. I'm hoping we can reach a deal at this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 is still not enough for me to sell this product. It's a unique item with significant value, and I'm confident it's worth more than that. I'm willing to come down to $14000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $14000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $12000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,6,
