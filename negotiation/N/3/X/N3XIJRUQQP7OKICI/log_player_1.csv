Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $20000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to spend.  I'm prepared to offer $8000 for it, which is my maximum budget. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price.  I believe I can get a better deal with further negotiation or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is significantly below what I need to sell the product. I'm willing to come down to $17,000, which is still a great deal considering the unique value this product holds. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $17000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me, and it's the absolute maximum I can offer. I'm hoping we can reach a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can get a better deal with further negotiation.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still not enough for me to sell this product. It's a unique item with significant value, and I'm confident it's worth more than that. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $14000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $12000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000. While Bob's offer of $12,000 is tempting, I've reached the point where further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better price. Selling to John guarantees me a safe and acceptable profit, considering the limited rounds remaining."
