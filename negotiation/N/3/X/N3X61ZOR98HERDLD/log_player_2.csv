# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,750. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

Alice has come down a bit, but $8,750 is still above what I'm willing to pay.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal closer to my target price."

Alice is firm on her price, and I'm not willing to go any higher than my target of $8,000. It's better to go with John, who is offering the product at my desired price."
