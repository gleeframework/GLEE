"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. Considering the true value and potential this product holds, I can come down to $975,000.  I believe this offer reflects a more accurate valuation while still acknowledging your interest.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap is still too wide for me.  To be fair to you, I think anything above $750,000 won't work for me.  If you can do something closer to that, I'm ready to close the deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your candor and willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is a significant difference from my initial asking price, I recognize the importance of finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  My final offer is $875,000. This price reflects a substantial adjustment on my end and represents my absolute limit to ensure a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,5,
