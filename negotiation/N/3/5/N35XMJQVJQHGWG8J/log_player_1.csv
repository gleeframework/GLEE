{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation, and hopefully allows me to maximize my earnings without losing the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I won't accept it. I'll try to get a better price from Bob, but if he's not willing to meet my minimum, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $65 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $85 is my absolute minimum.  This is still a great deal for you, and I hope you'll reconsider."", ""product_price"": 85}
