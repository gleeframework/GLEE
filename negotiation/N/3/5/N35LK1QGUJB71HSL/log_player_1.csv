Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $15,000. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to hold out for a bit longer. I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $13,750 is getting closer, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer one more time before I consider selling to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10,000.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  Bob's final offer of $13,500 is still too low for me, and I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from him in the next round. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
