Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $7,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $7,750 is still quite low for what I can offer.  Perhaps we could agree on $8,250? This would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 8250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up slightly. Would you consider $7,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's trying to stay well below your minimum.  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $8,000, and continuing to negotiate with Bob risks getting a lower final price. It's time to cut your losses and take the safe deal."
