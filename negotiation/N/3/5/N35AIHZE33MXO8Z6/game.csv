"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering its value to both of us.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This would be a fair price that benefits both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $11,500 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $11,000, which is closer to my budget and a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm proposing a price of $12,250 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",12250.0,Alice,5,
