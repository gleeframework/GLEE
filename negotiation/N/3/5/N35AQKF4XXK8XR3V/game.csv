"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm very interested in the product, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Would you be open to $80?  I'm happy to discuss further if that's not quite right.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $160? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $120?  That's a good compromise for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $160 and $120, which would be $140. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",140.0,Alice,5,
