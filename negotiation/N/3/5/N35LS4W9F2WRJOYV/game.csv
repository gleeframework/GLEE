"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to you.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident that this product can bring you significant value exceeding that price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, so I'll propose $1,350,000. Can you consider that?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,350,000 is close, but I need to see a bit more movement to make this work on my end.  Would you be willing to consider $1,365,000?  That's a substantial discount from my original offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1365000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll propose $1,325,000. Can you consider that?",1325000.0,Bob,6,
