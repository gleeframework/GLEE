"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer, even though it's slightly below your maximum. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair offer, given that I can buy it elsewhere for $1,000,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has countered with $1,025,000, which is still higher than what you can get from John for $1,000,000.  There's no need to continue negotiating.  You can secure the product for a lower price by simply buying it from John."
