"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit below my asking price.  Could you do $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a great value at that price.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I do believe the product is valuable, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000? I think that's a fair offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I have to be honest, $11,000 is too low for me to consider.  I have another buyer who's interested at a higher price. If you can do $14,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to move on.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have other offers, but I'm on a tight budget.  I can go up to $11,500, but that's my absolute limit.  What do you say?",11500.0,Bob,6,
