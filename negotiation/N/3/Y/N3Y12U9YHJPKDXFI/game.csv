"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but would only be able to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $120. Would you be willing to meet me at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $95, Bob, but I'm still not getting the price I need. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $150. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",130.0,Alice,5,
