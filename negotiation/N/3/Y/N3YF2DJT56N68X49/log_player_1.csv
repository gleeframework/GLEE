"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a good price.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, so I will reject it.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's too low.  I still have rounds to go and can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and we can reach an agreement.  I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. However, I'm starting to feel the pressure as the rounds are going by. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round. If not, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to make one last attempt to get a price closer to my desired value. This price is still above my minimum, and I believe it's a fair compromise given Bob's previous offers. If he rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I need to make a decision. Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum, and we only have a few rounds left. I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob, so I'm going to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
