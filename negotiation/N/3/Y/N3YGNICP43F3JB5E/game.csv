"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $950,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,000,000 to $950,000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the market value of similar products.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $875,000. I think this price is more reasonable considering the value of the product to me and the market value of similar products.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer.  How about $900,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",900000.0,Alice,7,
