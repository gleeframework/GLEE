,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me.  However, $150 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $110? I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a fair price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $130. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $125?  That way we can both split the difference. It's really important to me to get this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $127.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",127.5,Alice,5,
