"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justifying the Price:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the product is worth this much to Bob, it hints at its value and potential, leaving room for Bob to ask questions and for you to provide further justification in subsequent rounds. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes your willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging in a back-and-forth discussion.

This strategy aims to achieve a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation while leaving room to move closer to his price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a strong offer, exceeding Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate and try to close the gap. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed win, but there's potential to earn more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is still significantly below what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This reflects the true value of this unique product."", 
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  By coming down from the initial price, you signal to Bob that you're willing to negotiate. 
* **""Meet in the Middle"":**  This phrasing is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties, even though you're still aiming for a price well above Bob's valuation.
* **Reiterate Value:**  Continuing to emphasize the product's unique value helps justify the higher price. 

You're essentially cutting the difference between your first offer and Bob's counteroffer. This leaves room for further negotiation but keeps you in a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,075,000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeds Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Strong Position Unlikely:** While you could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might not budge much higher, especially since he's already exceeding his perceived value of the product. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means you get the money sooner, which has its own inherent value. 

Accepting this offer secures you a significant profit and avoids the risk of potentially losing the deal altogether by pushing for too much."
