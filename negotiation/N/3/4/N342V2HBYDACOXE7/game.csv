"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000.  I think it's a fair price, what do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  Could you do $17,000? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $17,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $11,500? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, it seems like we are getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This is a very fair offer considering the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I could make a final offer of $12,000. That's my limit, and I think it's a fair price considering John is also offering at that price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
