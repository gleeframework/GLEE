"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable asset. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you want a fair price, but I'm still a bit lower than $1700000. How about we meet at $1650000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about the long-term value of this product. How about we try $1680000? It's a bit above your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1680000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're thinking about the long-term value of the product, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet at $1660000? It's a small compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the initial offer was $1800000 and we've already met at $1680000.",1660000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1660000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about the minimum value I'm willing to accept. How about we try $1675000? It's a small increase, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1675000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1675000 and $1650000, which would be $1662500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1662500.0,Bob,8,

I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about the minimum value I'm willing to accept. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1662500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1675000 and $1662500, which would be $1668750. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one last time.",1668750.0,Alice,9,
