# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay up to $120 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, it's a good deal. There's no reason to reject the offer and buy from John at the same price."
