Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a higher price than John's offer, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is genuinely interested and has a higher valuation of the product. 

Here's why I chose this approach:

* **Maximize potential profit:** I'm aiming for the highest possible profit while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Risk assessment:** If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed John's offer, which is still a substantial profit for me.
* **Strategic pricing:**  Offering a higher price suggests the product is valuable and encourages Bob to consider its potential worth to him. 

By setting this price, I'm striking a balance between maximizing potential gains and minimizing the risk of losing the sale."
