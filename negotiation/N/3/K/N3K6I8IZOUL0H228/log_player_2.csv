"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. I'm asking for $1,400,000, reflecting its true worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than her product's value to her, you know you can get a better deal from John. Buying from John saves you $400,000, which is a significant amount."
