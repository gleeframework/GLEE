"I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make a small concession. I can offer you the product for $105. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm thinking more along the lines of $92.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",92.5,Bob,6,
