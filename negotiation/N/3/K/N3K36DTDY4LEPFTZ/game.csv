"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us. While $9,500 is a tempting offer, I can't go lower than $10,500. This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and my original offer of $9,500. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,6,
