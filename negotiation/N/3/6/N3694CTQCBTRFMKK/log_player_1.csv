Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great price considering its value to me. I'm confident it will be a profitable acquisition for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to capture some of the potential surplus.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $1,250,000 leaves room for negotiation, allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while still securing a profit for me.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the potential profit for Bob and making the offer seem attractive. 
* **Plan B:** I'm ready to walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000 if Bob doesn't meet my expectations. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. I will need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's willing to negotiate. There's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, while still leaving room for further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum price.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a considerable discount from my initial offer and still allows you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm not walking away completely. My counteroffer shows I'm open to negotiation but I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Incremental Adjustment:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not by too much. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also maintains my negotiating power.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the ""considerable discount"" to frame my counteroffer as a fair compromise.
* **Positive Outlook:** I'm ending with a positive message, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:** I will carefully consider Bob's next move. If he rejects my counteroffer, I might be willing to move closer to $1,000,000. However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, I'm starting to feel the pressure of potentially losing out on a higher price from John.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'm going to make one more counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. This will be my final offer. If Bob rejects it, I'll move on to selling to John.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap. If he rejects it, I'll sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I've gone back and forth on this, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $1,000,000.

If you're not able to meet that price, I'll be moving on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last counteroffer, emphasizing the finality of the situation. 
* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that's closer to his last offer but still above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, implying that $1,000,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Ready to Move On:** I'm clearly stating my intention to sell to John if Bob doesn't accept, creating a sense of urgency.
