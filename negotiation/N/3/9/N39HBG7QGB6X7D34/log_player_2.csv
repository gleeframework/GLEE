"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than his maximum budget of $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still above what he'd ideally like to pay.  Bob has already shown willingness to negotiate, so rejecting the offer again keeps the door open to a potentially lower price. There's still a chance Alice might come down to a price Bob is more comfortable with."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now higher than Bob's previous counteroffer. This suggests that Alice may not be willing to lower the price further.  It's likely that continued negotiation with Alice will lead to a price that's closer to $950,000 or higher.  Considering the potential for more rounds of negotiation and the risk of Alice eventually reaching her maximum, buying from John for $1,000,000 offers a predictable and guaranteed outcome. It's the safest option, even if it's slightly more expensive."
