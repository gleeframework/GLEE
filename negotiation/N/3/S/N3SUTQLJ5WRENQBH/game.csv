"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $1,000,000? I think that's a fair price considering its value and the current market.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
