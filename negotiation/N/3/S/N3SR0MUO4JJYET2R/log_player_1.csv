Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This offer gives you a good starting point, earning $50,000 above your minimum threshold.  It's also a reasonable price that Bob might consider. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Starting high:**  You want to maximize your potential profit.
* **Not too aggressive:**  $1,050,000 isn't so far off Bob's value that he'll immediately reject it.
* **Room for negotiation:**  It gives you space to lower the price if Bob counters without sacrificing too much profit.
* **John as backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 ensures you're not pressured to accept anything lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is important to both of us. However, I would like to propose a price of $980,000 for the product. I hope this is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  It's below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** You can still try to negotiate a higher price. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing you can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob. Consider offering a price slightly lower than your initial offer, but still above your minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $980,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer slightly lower:**  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain a respectful tone:**  The message emphasizes a desire for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  You're still open to further negotiation if needed. 

**Important Note:**  Keep in mind that John's offer of $1,000,000 is your safety net. If Bob doesn't accept your counteroffer, you have the option to sell to John and avoid a protracted negotiation."
