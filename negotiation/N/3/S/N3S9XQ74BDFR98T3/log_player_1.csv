{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll gain. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially secure a deal quickly and still achieve a high profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 is a strong starting point. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to make a decision sooner rather than risk losing the opportunity.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging Bob's valuation and the guaranteed sale to John."
