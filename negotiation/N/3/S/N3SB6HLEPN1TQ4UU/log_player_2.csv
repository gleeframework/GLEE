"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a reasonable price of $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $110 and $100. I'll offer you the product for $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob is willing to pay up to $120. Alice's offer of $105 is within his budget.
* **Saving:**  $105 is significantly better than John's price of $120, allowing Bob to save $15.
* **Negotiation:** While a lower price might be ideal, Alice is already showing flexibility, and further negotiation might not yield much more savings. There's a risk of losing the deal and ending up paying John's price. 

Accepting Alice's offer at $105 provides a good balance between saving money and securing the product."
