"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $14,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a little lower than what Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.  It also shows Bob that I am serious about selling the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's below my minimum threshold of $12,000.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price.  I have several rounds left, so I can afford to be patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $13,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,200 is close to my minimum threshold of $12,000 and it's better than selling to John for $12,000. I'll accept his offer to secure a deal and avoid further negotiations."
