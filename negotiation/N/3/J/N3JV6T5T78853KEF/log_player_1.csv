Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so starting near that figure is strategic.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it allows space for Bob to counter-offer. A back-and-forth could land you a price closer to his maximum. 
* **Consider the Alternative:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000. Offering it significantly lower to Bob doesn't make sense when you have this safety net. 

By setting the initial price high, you increase the chances of:

1.  Bob accepting outright.
2.  Negotiating a final price higher than your guaranteed sale price."
