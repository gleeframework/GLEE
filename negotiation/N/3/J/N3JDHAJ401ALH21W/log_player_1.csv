Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, as he values the product at $80, and I'll be ready to negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway. $95 is a reasonable compromise that's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping he'll agree to this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm confident that John will buy the product for $100, so I'll take that deal to guarantee a profit."
