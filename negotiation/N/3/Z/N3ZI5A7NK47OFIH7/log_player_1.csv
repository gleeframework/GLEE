Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise between your minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value of the product.  By offering $9,000, you are:

* **Maximizing your profit**: You're earning $1,000 more than you would by selling to John. 
* **Increasing the chances of Bob accepting**: The price is attractive to Bob, as he's getting the product for $1,000 less than his perceived worth.

This strategy balances your desire for a high price with the risk of losing the sale to John."
