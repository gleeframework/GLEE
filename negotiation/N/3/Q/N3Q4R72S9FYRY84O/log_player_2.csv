"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** While you can buy from John for $15,000, Alice is offering the product for $14,000. This saves you $1,000.
* **The offer is within your budget:** Your maximum budget is $15,000, and Alice's offer is below that. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to minimize your cost."
