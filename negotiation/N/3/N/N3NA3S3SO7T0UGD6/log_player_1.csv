Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it really valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point, as it's above my minimum of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants a lower price.  It also demonstrates that I'm confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price. It's not a good deal for me. While I could accept and sell to him, it's worth risking a counteroffer or selling to John if I don't get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we settle in the middle at $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $107.5 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. Since John is willing to pay my minimum, it's more secure to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
