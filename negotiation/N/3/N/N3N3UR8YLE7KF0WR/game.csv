"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too far below my asking price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the significant value this product can bring to your operations.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize a deal with you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit low for me.  To demonstrate my commitment to a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,500,000.  This is a final offer, as it aligns with the value I place on the product.  Let me know your decision.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
