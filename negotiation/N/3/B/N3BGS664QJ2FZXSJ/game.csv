,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $20000 was a bit high. However, $12000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $17000?  This is a fair price considering the value this product can offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $14000? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to be able to afford it.",14000.0,Bob,4,
