"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open and friendly:** I'm not being aggressive, just stating my initial price and inviting Bob to respond.
* **Value proposition:**  I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing too much.

**Note:**  This is just the first offer. I'll be watching Bob's response and adjusting my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:** $12,000 is well below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** I believe we can reach a mutually agreeable price somewhere between his offer and my initial asking price.
* **I'm not desperate:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, but I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to potentially get a better price.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $20,000 was a bit high. However, $12,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  This is a fair price considering the value this product can offer."", ""product_price"": 17000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $17,000 is a middle ground between my previous offer and his, which makes it a more palatable option.

**Next Steps:** I'll closely monitor Bob's response and decide whether to further adjust my offer based on his reaction. I'm committed to finding a solution that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $14000? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to be able to afford it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I could try for a higher price, there's a chance Bob might walk away. 
* **Time constraint:** With only 6 rounds left, it's crucial to secure a deal. 

**Next Steps:** I'm willing to accept Bob's offer, but I'll try to negotiate some additional benefits, like faster delivery or a small discount on future purchases."
