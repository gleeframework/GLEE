Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175} 
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below what I would get from John. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a good compromise, as it's still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his acceptable range. Hopefully, this will incentivize him to accept, but I'm still prepared to walk away if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to go any lower.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with, so I'll take the sure thing and sell to him."
