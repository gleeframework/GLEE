Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Zone:**  Ideally, you want to sell it for more than your minimum but less than Bob's maximum. This creates a win-win.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that benefits both of us. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strategic Positioning:** The message starts by highlighting the product's value to Bob, setting a positive tone.
* **Mutually Beneficial:** Mentioning a price that ""benefits both of us"" frames the negotiation as cooperative.
* **Strong Opening:** $1,350,000 is a strong opening offer. It's well above your minimum and leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:**  Bob might counter-offer. Have a strategy for how low you're willing to go.
* **Walk Away Point:** Remember, you have John as a backup. Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob's offer goes below your acceptable range. 
* **Confidence:**  Project confidence in your offer.  This can subtly influence Bob's perception of the product's value."
