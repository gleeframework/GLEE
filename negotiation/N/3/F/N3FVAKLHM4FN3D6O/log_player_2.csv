"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that benefits both of us. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000. 

Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save $150,000."
