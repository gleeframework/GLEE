"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps in the $1,100,000 range?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,250,000? This reflects the value while acknowledging your interest.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly.  Would you be open to $1,150,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach. Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, reflecting a significant compromise to ensure you benefit from this unique opportunity.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
