"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps in the $1,100,000 range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,250,000? This reflects the value while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly.  Would you be open to $1,150,000?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly above John's offer. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach. Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, reflecting a significant compromise to ensure you benefit from this unique opportunity."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close to the halfway point in our negotiations, and we need to start applying pressure while still leaving room for Bob to come up slightly.  By stating this is our final offer, we increase the chance of Bob accepting this price, while leaving the option to continue negotiating if needed."
