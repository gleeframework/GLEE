Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with my ideal price, knowing it's likely Bob won't accept it. This sets the baseline and lets me see how much he's willing to negotiate.  I'm prepared to counter-offer and potentially even sell to John if Bob isn't serious about reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still less than my minimum.  I'm confident I can get closer to my asking price through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. $950,000 is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it also ensures I get closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $920,000, which is closer to my minimum.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, I don't want to risk losing the sale to John.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I secure a good price and close the deal."
