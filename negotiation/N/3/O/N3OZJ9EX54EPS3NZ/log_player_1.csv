{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have an advantage knowing Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, so there's no pressure to go below that price.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:**  You make a great profit, exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Bob negotiates:** This opens the door for you to gauge his willingness to pay and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Bob rejects:** You move on to John and secure your $15,000, still a favorable outcome."
