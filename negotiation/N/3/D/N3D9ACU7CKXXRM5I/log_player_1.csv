I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation, but also reflects the fact that the product is worth at least $12,000 to me. I'm hoping to get a price closer to $15,000, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to get a bit closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm offering $13,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12,000."

Bob has come up to $13,000, which is close enough to my initial offer that I'm willing to accept. It's more than my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
