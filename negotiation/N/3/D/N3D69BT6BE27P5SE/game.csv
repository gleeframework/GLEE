"Alice, thank you for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the potential value it has for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get closer to your budget. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $875,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $860,000.  This is a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to meet you at $870,000, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",870000.0,Alice,5,
