Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think it's a steal at this price and you'll really love it!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 
 
Here's why this offer makes sense: 
* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $120 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially settling at a price still above $120.
* **Maintain Believability:**  Offering it at Bob's perceived value ($80) or too close to your minimum ($120) might seem suspicious."
