"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $700000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This price still offers you a significant return on investment while allowing me to make a profit. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $850000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $750000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's finalize this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
