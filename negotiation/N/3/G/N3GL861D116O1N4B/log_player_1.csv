"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it offers. I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Rationale:**

* **High starting point:**  I'm starting high to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the product's potential value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to a discussion and finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product,  considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While $700,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my floor of $800,000. I'm not willing to sell at a loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **John is a backup:** Having John as a backup option gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $700,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still offers you a significant return on investment while allowing me to make a profit. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your business."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my desired price.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm still emphasizing the potential benefits and return on investment for Bob.
* **Firm but fair:** I'm maintaining my minimum acceptable price but offering a price that is potentially more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $850000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $750000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Time is running out:** With only 6 rounds left, continuing to negotiate risks losing the chance to sell to John for a guaranteed $800,000.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures a profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower price. 

It's better to secure the guaranteed profit with John than to risk losing more rounds and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob."
