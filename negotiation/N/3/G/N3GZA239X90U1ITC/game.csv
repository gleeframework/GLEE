,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,100,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Given my budget constraints, I can offer $850,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the potential of this product and my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  To show you I'm serious about making a deal, I'll come down to $950,000. However, I need you to meet me halfway.  This is my final offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,
