"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is quite close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to get a better price. Rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer keeps the possibility of a better deal alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer aims for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation.  It also signals that you're serious about buying but need a more attractive price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and she's indicating this is her final offer. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll hold firm, and you'll end up paying John's higher price. Accepting the $11,000 offer secures a reasonable saving compared to your alternative."
