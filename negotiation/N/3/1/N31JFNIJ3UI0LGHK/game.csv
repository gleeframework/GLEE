"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $130 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $125 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $135 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $125.  I believe it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal as well.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $125 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $132. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",132.0,Alice,5,
