Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I believe a price of $1,300,000 would be fair. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing on a price higher than your minimum ($800,000).
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 gives you leverage to walk away if Bob tries to negotiate too low.

This strategy balances ambition with a safety net, increasing your chances of securing a great deal."
