"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $100. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your Value:** You value the product at $120.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is selling for $100.
* **John's Price:** John is selling for $120.

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $20 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, there's no guarantee she'll lower the price.  The $100 offer is a good deal for you."
