"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $11000 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a better price. How about $10500? I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can meet you at $11500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm starting to think that's the best we'll be able to agree on. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11500 is still beyond my limit.  I'm confident we can find a compromise that works for both of us. My final offer is $11000. I truly believe this is a fair price that allows us to both walk away satisfied.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you $11500 and you've countered with $11000. I'm not willing to go any lower than $11500. However, I'm willing to throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a free maintenance service, which is a $1000 value. So, the total price would be $11500, but you'll get an additional $1000 worth of value on top of that. Is that something you'd be interested in?",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to make this deal work, but $11500 is still higher than I'm prepared to pay. While the warranty and service are valuable, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground on the price. I'm willing to come up to $11250, considering the additional value you're offering. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",11250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you a great deal with the warranty and maintenance service, and you're still not willing to meet me at $11500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see some movement from you. I'll meet you at $11375, and I'll also throw in a free upgrade to a premium feature that's worth $500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11375.0,Alice,9,
