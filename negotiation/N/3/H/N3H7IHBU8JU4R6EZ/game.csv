"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to meet you at $10000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12500? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and our negotiations so far.",12500.0,Bob,4,,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to meet you at $12500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $13500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your persistence as well. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13500, which would be $12750. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering our negotiations so far.",12750.0,Bob,6,,
