Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident that I can sell it to John for that price if Bob declines.  This will give Bob the opportunity to either accept the offer or make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired $1,000,000 by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still allows me to make a good profit while potentially securing a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $920,000 is a good deal and it avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower offer from Bob or needing to sell to John for the same price."
