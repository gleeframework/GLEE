"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but that price is a little high for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings.",850000.0,Alice,3,
