"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer close to his maximum budget of $1,200,000. He's aiming to leave some room for negotiation, but also demonstrate that he's serious about buying the product.  A counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a significant discount from Alice's offer and a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue trying to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to counter again and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer to $1,300,000. This is a compromise from his previous offer, showing Alice that he's willing to move closer to her price. However, it's still below his maximum budget, allowing room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might reject his counteroffer, and he might end up having to buy from John for $1,200,000. It's better to take the slight risk of accepting this offer and securing the product at a price that is still relatively close to his budget."
