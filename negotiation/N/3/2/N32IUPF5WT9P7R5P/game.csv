"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still not able to meet the price of $9,000. I would like to propose $8,800 as a counteroffer.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your persistence and I'm happy to continue working towards a deal.  However, $8,800 is still a little too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $8,900?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'd still get a great value for the product.  Let me know what you think!",8900.0,Alice,5,
