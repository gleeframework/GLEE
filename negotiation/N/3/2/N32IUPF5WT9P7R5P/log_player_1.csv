Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** $9,500 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, highlighting the product's value and leaving room for Bob to express his interest. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a high price:** By starting high, we maximize potential profit.
* **Encourage negotiation:** The message invites Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially counteroffer.
* **Maintain flexibility:** We can adjust our price based on Bob's response, while also having the option to sell to John if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is still a decent sum, it's significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. Selling to John guarantees that minimum, and it's worth exploring further negotiation with Bob before accepting such a low offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, hopefully finding a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer price:**  $9,000 represents a compromise. It's a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes understanding Bob's situation while reiterating the product's value and potential for a mutually beneficial deal.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to:

* **Maintain a firm stance:**  By refusing Bob's initial offer, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate but also my commitment to a fair price.
* **Show flexibility:** The counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** The message invites Bob to engage further and potentially reach a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still not able to meet the price of $9,000. I would like to propose $8,800 as a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's counteroffer of $8,800 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm not prepared to accept a price that doesn't meet my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $8,800, aiming to close the gap and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your persistence and I'm happy to continue working towards a deal.  However, $8,800 is still a little too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $8,900?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'd still get a great value for the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer price:** $8,900 is a small increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still staying close to my desired price.
* **Message:** The message continues to show my understanding of Bob's budget constraints while highlighting the product's value and the potential for a win-win situation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Close the gap:** A slight increase in price shows a willingness to compromise, bringing us closer to a possible agreement.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I retain some bargaining power and avoid settling for a price that's too low.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** The message encourages Bob to respond and potentially finalize the deal.

If Bob rejects this offer, I will have to seriously consider selling the product to John, as it's becoming increasingly likely that Bob won't meet my minimum value."
