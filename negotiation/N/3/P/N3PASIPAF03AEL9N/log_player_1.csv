Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $950,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $950,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a price he finds more agreeable, while still netting you a significant profit. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties adds a touch of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly."
