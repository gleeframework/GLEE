"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $12000. How about $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I really need to be careful with my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $13500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not convinced that $13500 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $13800?",13800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer of $13000. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John.",13000.0,Bob,6,
