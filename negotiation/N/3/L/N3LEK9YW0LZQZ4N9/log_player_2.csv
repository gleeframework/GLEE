"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Buying from Alice at $9,500 saves you $500 compared to buying from John at $10,000. 
* **You still get a good deal:**  While you'd prefer to pay less, $9,500 is still within your budget and lower than your perceived value of $10,000."
