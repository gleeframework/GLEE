"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Could you consider coming down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that's still a little steep for my budget. How about $800,000? That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my best and final offer for now.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
