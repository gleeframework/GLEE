"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than what Bob is willing to pay. He should reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's offer.  This signals his serious intention to buy but also sets a strong starting point for negotiation. He's aiming to secure a price as close to his maximum as possible, hoping to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still slightly higher. Bob should reject and continue negotiating, as he has a backup option with John that offers a better price. There's still room for Alice to lower her price, and Bob can potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increases his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is still lower than Alice's current offer, but it's closer to a potential compromise, especially if Alice is keen to sell.  He's aiming to find a middle ground while staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, and the negotiation is starting to drag on. There are only five rounds left, and each round further reduces Bob's negotiating power. Since Bob has a guaranteed option with John for a lower price, it's in his best interest to secure the product now and avoid potential further price increases from Alice."
