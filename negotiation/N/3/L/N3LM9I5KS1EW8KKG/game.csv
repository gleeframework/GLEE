"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,500, given your stated value for the product. This is a fair price considering we're both looking for a win-win. Let's close this deal!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  I can see we both want to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $7,750 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $8,250. This is my final offer, let's close this deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $8,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  How about $8,000 even? This is my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
