Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, but it's closer than his initial rejection. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer but is closer to his desired price.  It also keeps me closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below. I'm willing to continue negotiating with him, as I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,450,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I hope that by showing some flexibility, I can encourage Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've made several concessions already. I'm confident that John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm going to sell the product to him and avoid further negotiations."
