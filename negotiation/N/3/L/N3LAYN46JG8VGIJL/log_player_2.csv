"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,650,000. I believe it's a fair price, considering its worth to you. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. However, if you choose to decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my minimum asking price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your decision by [date/time] so I can proceed accordingly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is reasonable, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. By rejecting the offer, Bob can secure the product from John for a price that fits within his budget."
