"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. I understand it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a significant discount, and it allows me to earn a considerable amount while still offering you a great deal. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
