"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it aims to set a strong baseline for negotiation. I'm hoping to get Alice to come down considerably from her initial price. If she rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer in subsequent rounds, aiming for a price closer to my maximum budget of $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,750,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,250,000, which is still below Alice's offer, but closer to my maximum budget. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a fair price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to her and get us closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still slightly above it. I'm not willing to accept a price higher than my maximum budget, especially with a few rounds remaining. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming to reach a price closer to my maximum budget of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $1,400,000, which is within my maximum budget and closer to Alice's last offer.  We're getting closer, and I believe this offer is fair to both of us. If Alice rejects again, I'll consider raising my offer slightly in the next round, but I'll be prepared to buy from John if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is now within my maximum budget of $1,500,000 and is getting closer to what I'm willing to pay.  While I'd prefer to get it lower, it's reasonable to accept this offer given the limited rounds remaining.  We're likely to continue to haggle if I reject, but there's a risk that we might not reach an agreement before I have to buy from John.  It's better to secure a deal now at a price I can comfortably afford."
