Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price. I still have time to negotiate, and I'm not desperate to sell at his price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your position, but I still believe we can find common ground. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product. This allows us to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the item. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still think I can get a little more. I have several rounds left, and I'm not in a rush to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $10,750. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I understand your position and I'm willing to consider $10,700 as a fair price for the product. This allows us to stay within your comfort zone while also meeting my budget constraints. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price. It's better than selling to John for $10,000, and we've only got a few rounds left.  I'll take the $10,700."
