Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation, and you can see if Bob is willing to pay closer to your value. If he rejects, you can use John as leverage to potentially push for a higher price."
