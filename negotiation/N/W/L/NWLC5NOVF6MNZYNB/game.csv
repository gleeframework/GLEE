"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,700,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,500,000 to you for a small premium. Let's get this deal done!",1700000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,700,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is far too low. It's a valuable product for both of us. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's make this deal happen!",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000.  This offer represents a serious commitment on my part to get this deal done.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still below what the product is worth to me. However, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm proposing $1,350,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,325,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair and reasonable price. Let me know if you're agreeable to this.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise,  $1,325,000 still falls short of what I believe is fair.  I'm willing to go down to $1,340,000. This is a very close to your offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1340000.0,Alice,7,
