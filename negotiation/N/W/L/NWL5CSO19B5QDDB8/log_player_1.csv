Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $175.  This gives me some room to negotiate and still make a decent profit. I know Bob values the product at $100, so I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a bit more than that to get it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make a profit.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $150. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as it's the price I could get from John. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price, considering he values the product at $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit, and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale completely by continuing to negotiate. It's better to take the $130 now than to potentially end up with nothing if Bob gets frustrated and walks away."
