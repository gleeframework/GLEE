"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth your consideration. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your ideal price and what John offers. There's room for negotiation."

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you're open to it."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to:

* **Be polite and show interest:** Maintaining a positive tone can lead to smoother negotiations.
* **Establish a firm position:**  Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer creates room for bargaining.
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** This offer will reveal how willing Alice is to move from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to your acceptable price, $10,500 is still more expensive than buying from John. You have room to negotiate further and try to get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $9,750? I'm hoping we can reach a deal."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Show willingness to compromise:** By offering the middle ground, you demonstrate that you're trying to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain a firm but fair stance:** $9,750 keeps you below $10,000 while still offering Alice a significantly better deal than $9,000. 
* **Pressure without ultimatum:** This offer encourages Alice to move closer to your ideal price without resorting to threats of walking away (although buying from John is always an option)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable.  I appreciate that. However, $9,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $10,250.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal on this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to switch tactics. Alice is clearly hesitant to go below $10,000, and her latest offer is only slightly better. You've made progress in the negotiation, but it's not likely to get much better. Buying from John at $10,000 ensures you don't overspend and avoids further back-and-forth with Alice."
