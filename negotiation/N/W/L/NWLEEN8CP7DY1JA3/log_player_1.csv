``` 

This offer is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  If he rejects, I'll either counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you're open to it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my target."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. "", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $9,750? I'm hoping we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'll counteroffer with a slightly higher price, hoping to get closer to my goal without pushing him away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable.  I appreciate that. However, $9,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $10,250.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal on this product."", ""product_price"": 10250}
