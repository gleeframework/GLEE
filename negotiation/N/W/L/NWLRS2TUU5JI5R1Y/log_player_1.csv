Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance to get even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 is a strong starting point. It's a price that allows for some negotiation but still ensures a significant profit margin.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:**  The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, hoping to entice him to accept the offer without further negotiation."
