I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is the price I'd get from John, so it's my ideal outcome. If Bob rejects, I can always go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I need. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is too low for me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial price, but still closer to my desired value than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also that I won't sell for a price drastically lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's a slight improvement, it's not enough for me to accept. I'll counteroffer again, trying to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a further compromise, showing I'm flexible, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum value. This is a last attempt to reach a deal with Bob before I go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly unwilling to meet my minimum price.  I've already made significant concessions and it's clear further negotiation won't lead to a satisfactory price. It's time to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
