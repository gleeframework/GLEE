,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is way out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $1,000,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you considering its value, and it allows me to reach my desired price point. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $950,000 to make this deal worthwhile. This is a very reasonable offer given the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. ",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but I'm still limited by my budget. I can offer $925,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, and we're getting closer.  $925,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit short of my target. To make this work, I need $940,000. This represents a fair compromise, and it's the last concession I can make.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal for both of us.",940000.0,Alice,7,
