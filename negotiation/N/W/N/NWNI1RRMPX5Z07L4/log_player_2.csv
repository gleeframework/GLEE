{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is way out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $1,000,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you considering its value, and it allows me to reach my desired price point.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $950,000 to make this deal worthwhile. This is a very reasonable offer given the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts, and we're getting closer.  $925,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit short of my target. To make this work, I need $940,000. This represents a fair compromise, and it's the last concession I can make.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
