"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a great start, but I'm unfortunately not able to go that high.  Given my budget constraints, I can offer $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business, and I'm eager to make this deal happen.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,050,000 is getting closer, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is the absolute maximum I can offer.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your final decision.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to sacrifice any more value. I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
