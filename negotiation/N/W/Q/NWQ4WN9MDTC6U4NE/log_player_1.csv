Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is strategic for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.** This leaves space for Bob to potentially counter with a lower price, allowing for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually agreeable price.
* **It's closer to my minimum value, maximizing potential profit.**  By starting higher, I give myself more room to negotiate downwards if necessary. 
* **It sets a strong starting point.** A higher initial offer can give Bob the impression that the product is truly valuable, making him more likely to negotiate seriously.

**Important Note:** I'm still keeping in mind that I have a fallback option with John.  If Bob rejects this offer and his counteroffers are too low, I won't hesitate to go with John's guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.** While it's closer than his initial perceived value, I'm not willing to settle for a significant loss. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  I'm confident I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net.**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob and can always fall back on John's guaranteed offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a more favorable deal.  I will now send a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $880,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Fairness:** I'm aiming for a price that's both profitable for me and within Bob's range.
* **Motivation:**  By offering a slightly lower price, I'm encouraging Bob to counter with an offer closer to my desired range.

**Remember:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind. If Bob's counteroffer is too low or if the negotiation stalls, I'll be happy to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $830,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $830,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $830,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to take a substantial loss.
* **The negotiation has stalled.** Bob's latest offer indicates he's not willing to meet me halfway.
* **Selling to John is the most sensible choice.**  It guarantees me my desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who is clearly unwilling to pay what the product is worth to me.

I've reached a point where continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to lead to a better outcome.  John's offer provides me with the financial security I need, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
