"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's best to reject and start negotiating.  There's a chance you can get a better price from Alice or, if negotiations fail, you can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a very low counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it signals my strong desire to negotiate a favorable price. This is a bold move, but it might force Alice to come down from her initial price. If she rejects this counteroffer, I'm prepared to make adjustments in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'll continue to negotiate, hoping to get a better price or, if necessary, buy from John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,250,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's price but still within my budget. I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate, hoping to find a middle ground. If this offer is rejected, I'll need to reassess my strategy and consider the risk of going with John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget.  I need to continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price. There's a chance she'll come down further, or I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $1,400,000. This is a significant step closer to Alice's offer, showing I'm serious about closing the deal. However, it's still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation if needed. We are now in the second half of the rounds, so I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to accept a reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still $100,000 higher than my desired price. I'm not willing to accept yet, especially since there are still a few rounds left. I'll continue to push for a lower price, but I'm also starting to consider the possibility of buying from John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is my maximum budget. I'm hoping Alice will accept, as it's a fair price for both of us.  If she rejects, I'll have no choice but to buy from John to ensure I get the product.  With only two rounds remaining, I'm not willing to risk further negotiations."
