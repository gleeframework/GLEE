"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to test Bob's willingness to pay and gauge his bargaining range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a tempting offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I believe there is still room for negotiation with Bob, and I can potentially earn more by continuing the process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still reflects the value of the product while giving you a fair price. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I ideally want.  I believe there's still room for further negotiation, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to come up in price.  I'll continue the process in hopes of securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'll accept $10,000.  This price is fair for both of us and will allow us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to a deal, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,750. Can we make it work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,750 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable with it. I'm determined to reach a price closer to $10,000 and believe I have room to negotiate. I'll see if I can get Bob to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to come down to $9,900.  This is my final offer.  If we can agree on this, we can close the deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you can accept it, we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I've tried to negotiate with Bob, but it's clear we're not going to reach an agreeable price. Rather than continue negotiating and potentially wasting more time, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000. This ensures I get my desired price and maximizes my profit."
