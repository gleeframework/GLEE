{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially find a price we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think the product sounds interesting, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product! While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is still a great price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum but still below my ideal.  I'm hoping that by showing I'm willing to compromise, Bob will be more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want to get for the product.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50? This is a fair price that's closer to what I need and still within a reasonable range for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
``` 

I'm going for a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility and hopefully will lead to a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I think I can go a bit lower. Would you be willing to meet me at $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob.  Even though $82 is closer to my minimum, I've already made multiple concessions and the negotiation isn't getting me any closer to my desired price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120, which guarantees me my minimum."
