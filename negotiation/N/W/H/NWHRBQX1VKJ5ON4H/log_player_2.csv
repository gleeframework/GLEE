"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it would greatly benefit your business. Given its value, I propose a price of $9,500 for this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the value of the product. However, my budget for this purchase is capped at $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value and unique features of our product, I believe we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I am willing to lower the price to $8,500 for this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still above his budget. Since there are still more rounds available, Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal.  He can try to counteroffer again to push for that $8,000 price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,250.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your input and am glad we're finding common ground. To further accommodate your budget while valuing the product's true worth, I propose a final price of $8,400. This allows us to strike a balance between fairness and value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $400 above Bob's maximum budget. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate. If Bob rejects the offer, he might not be able to secure a better price, and he risks running out of time.  Accepting the offer ensures that Bob gets the product and doesn't have to resort to buying from John."
