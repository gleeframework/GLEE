"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18000 was a bit steep, but I was hoping you'd see the value in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to pay $13,000. This offer reflects the value I see in the product and my financial limitations. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a little concerned that we might not be able to come to an agreement. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I can offer it to you for $14500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500

```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her previous offers, it is still above his budget. He can likely negotiate a lower price or buy from John. It's important to remember that Bob has already rejected Alice's offer twice, so she is likely to be more receptive to a counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $14,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000.

Otherwise, I will have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 14000}

Round 7

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating, but $14,200 is still slightly over my budget. I'm firm at $13,500.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm at $13500, but I'm still not making enough to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be realistic about my losses. I can offer it to you for $14000, but this is as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, it's still above Bob's budget, and the negotiation has gone on for many rounds. He's already rejected several of her offers.  At this point, it's clear Alice is not going to come down to a price that's acceptable to Bob.  Buying from John is the best option to get the product at a price that works for him."
