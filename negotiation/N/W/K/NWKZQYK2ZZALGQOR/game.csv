"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for this product. It's a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18000 was a bit steep, but I was hoping you'd see the value in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to pay $13000. This offer reflects the value I see in the product and my financial limitations. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a little concerned that we might not be able to come to an agreement. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I can offer it to you for $14500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $14500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best chance to finalize the deal. If you are willing to accept this offer, we can move forward. Otherwise, I will have to consider other options.",14000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I can offer it to you for $14200. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",14200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating, but $14200 is still slightly over my budget. I'm firm at $13500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my financial limitations.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",13500.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm at $13500, but I'm still not making enough to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be realistic about my losses. I can offer it to you for $14000, but this is as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,9,
