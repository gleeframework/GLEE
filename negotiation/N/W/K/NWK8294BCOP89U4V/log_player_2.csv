"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a good starting point. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation and keeps us well below our $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm fully comfortable with. Let's see if we can negotiate a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $110? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

We're splitting the difference here and proposing a price that should be tempting for Alice while still saving us a good amount compared to John's offer.  By stating we are ready to close at this price, we add a bit of pressure and signal that this is a serious offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $115. That's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling this is her bottom line. Accepting this offer gets us the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer, and continuing to negotiate might make us lose the deal."
