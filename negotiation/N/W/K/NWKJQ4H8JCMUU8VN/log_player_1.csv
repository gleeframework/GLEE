Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $15,000 gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a significantly higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.  

**Important:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant."
