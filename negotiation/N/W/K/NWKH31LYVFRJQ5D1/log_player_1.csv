"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum desired price.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000.  It's not even close to what I consider a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as anything less would be a loss for me.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, though it is a slight improvement.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm on my value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum desired price, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since we have more rounds remaining.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a small step towards Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product at more than $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm not sure if I can get Bob to agree to a price higher than $9,500. It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm still not comfortable selling for that low.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, it's safer to go with that option and secure a better profit."
