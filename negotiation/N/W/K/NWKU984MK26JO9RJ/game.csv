"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. While I appreciate your perspective on the market value, I believe the product holds even greater potential than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This recognizes its true worth while still offering you a significant opportunity.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $1,650,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider that price?",1650000.0,Bob,4,
