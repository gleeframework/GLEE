"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is more than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a significant discount from my original price.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11500.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to land somewhere between his offer and my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $12,250?  I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  My absolute maximum is $11750.  This would allow us to both walk away feeling like we got a fair deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $11,750 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I've already had five rounds of negotiation, and I'm not confident I can push Bob higher.  Given that I can sell to John for $12,000, I'm going to take that offer and secure a guaranteed sale."
