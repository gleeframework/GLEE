"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000, which is a significant discount from my original price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11500.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $12250?  I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  My absolute maximum is $11750.  This would allow us to both walk away feeling like we got a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",11750.0,Bob,6,
