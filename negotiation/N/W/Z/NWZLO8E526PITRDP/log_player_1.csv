Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum price of $8,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's maximum value of $10,000, leaving space for him to negotiate. 
* **It's a strong opening:** A strong opening price sets a high bar for future negotiations.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still being open to negotiation. Keep in mind that you have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $8,000, so you're not in a desperate position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $7000. I understand if this is not possible, but I wanted to see if we could come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum price, and it doesn't make sense to sell at that price. While it's tempting to accept to avoid further negotiation, remember that you have a fallback option with John.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $8,500 to make this worth it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:**  You're not accepting his low offer, but you are showing flexibility.
* **Is still above your minimum:** You're ensuring you make a profit while remaining open to negotiation.
* **Includes a clear message:** You're communicating your reasons for the price and showing a willingness to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $8000 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise given the value you place on it and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly what John is offering.  Since you're not motivated to continue negotiating, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale. You've achieved your minimum goal and can now move on to other opportunities."
