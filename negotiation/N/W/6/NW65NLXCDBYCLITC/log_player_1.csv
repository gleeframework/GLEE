Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and worth a lot more to the right person. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  It also leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still lower than the value you've placed on the product.  You can likely get a better price.  Let's see if you can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
