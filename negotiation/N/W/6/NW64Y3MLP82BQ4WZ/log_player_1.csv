{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob you're serious about selling but aren't desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $90 is a good deal for you.  It's higher than your minimum price of $80 and is within your desired range.  Accepting his offer is the best course of action."
