"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a fair price considering the value it offers. Let's meet in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $13,750. This way, we both get a fair price and can close this deal.",13750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  How about we settle at $13,000?  That's my final offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,
