"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $900,000? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we try to split the difference again and land at $750,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're willing to split the difference, Bob. I appreciate that. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
