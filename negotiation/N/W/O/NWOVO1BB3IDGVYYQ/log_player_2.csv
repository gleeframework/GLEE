Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to split the difference, Bob. I appreciate that. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price that should work for both of us.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. It's better to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $800,000."
