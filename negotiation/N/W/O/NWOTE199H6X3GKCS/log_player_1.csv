{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum value of $150 but still potentially attractive to Bob. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
While I'd like to sell the product, Bob's offer is my minimum. I will try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}

I'm offering a counteroffer of $175. This is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's offer.  I believe this price is still fair, while showing flexibility to reach an agreement."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160

Bob's offer is a good compromise. While I'd prefer to get closer to $175, accepting his offer ensures a sale and a price above my minimum."
