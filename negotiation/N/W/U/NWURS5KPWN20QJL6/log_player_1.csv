Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to come up to $1,200,000. This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to look at other options.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tough one! Bob is getting very close to my minimum, and I know he values the product significantly more than he's offering. However, I also know John is a guaranteed sale. 

Let's analyze:

* **Accepting Bob's offer:** I get $1,200,000, a $200,000 profit.
* **Rejecting and countering:** This is risky. Bob might walk away, leaving me with John's offer of $1,000,000.
* **Accepting John's offer:**  This is the ""safe"" option, guaranteeing $1,000,000.

While there's a chance to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing Bob entirely is too great.
