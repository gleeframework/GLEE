Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 20000 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Since we know Bob values the product at $15,000, starting higher gives room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit for Alice. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without excessive bargaining.
* **Not going too high:** While we want to maximize profit, an excessively high price (e.g., $30,000) might make Bob immediately disengage.  The $20,000 offer leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, Alice might need to adjust her offer."
