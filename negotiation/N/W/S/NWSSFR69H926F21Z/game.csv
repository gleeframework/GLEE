"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92. Can you meet me at that price?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $92 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Let's split the difference -  how about $93.50?  It's a fair compromise and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",93.5,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer! I understand you're trying to save money, but $91 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",92.5,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence! However, $92.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,8,
