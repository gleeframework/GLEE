Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While $9,750 is closer, it's still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference one last time and settle at $10,125.  I'm confident you'll find this a great deal for such a valuable product.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is trying to meet me in the middle, it's clear she's not going to go much lower than her current offer of $10,125.  At this point, the potential savings from continuing to negotiate with Alice are minimal compared to the guaranteed price of $10,000 from John. It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing."
