"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand it's a bit of a price difference, but the quality of this product is really top-notch. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $95 from Bob is better than the guaranteed $100 from John. It's a small loss compared to my ideal price, but a gain over the alternative."
