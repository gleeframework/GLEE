Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a fair offer, it's a bit lower than where I need to be.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 still doesn't fully cover the unique value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects the value I see in securing a deal with you.  Let's find a way to close this deal and ensure both of us walk away satisfied.
