"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I'm confident that this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,400,000 undervalues it. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000.  I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has significant value, but $1,650,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,500,000 is a tempting offer, I need to be sure this deal reflects the full value of what I'm providing.  Let's settle at $1,575,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth.",1575000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,550,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
