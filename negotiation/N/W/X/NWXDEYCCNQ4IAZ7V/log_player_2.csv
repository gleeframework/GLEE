Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $900,000? This offer reflects the product's true worth while still providing you a fair deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $850,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price considering the benefits this product will bring you.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $850,000 and it's her ""final offer.""  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $800,000, it makes more sense to go with that option and save $50,000."
