"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your work, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I see the value in the product, but that price point is a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $900,000? This offer reflects the product's true worth while still providing you a fair deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $700,000?  That's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $850,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price considering the benefits this product will bring you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
