"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been working on for a while and I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,000,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
