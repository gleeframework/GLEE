"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would you be open to that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $9,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
