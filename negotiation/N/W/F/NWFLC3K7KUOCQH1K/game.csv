"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $12,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $16,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $12,000, but I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll offer you the product for $14,000. This is my final concession, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and offer $13,000. Let's see if we can finally agree on a price.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, but I'm not willing to meet you at $13,000. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my previous offer. I'll meet you at $13,500. This is my final concession, so I hope we can seal the deal.",13500.0,Alice,7,
