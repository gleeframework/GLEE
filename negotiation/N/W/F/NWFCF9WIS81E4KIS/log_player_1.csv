Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer, followed by the offer itself:

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's primary goal is to get the highest price possible.
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,500,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Alice needs to offer a price attractive enough for Bob to accept but above his valuation.

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. I've carefully considered its value and believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message aims to create a sense of exclusivity and urgency. By mentioning ""other interested parties,"" Alice subtly hints at John's offer without revealing the exact amount. 
* **Product Price:**  $1,350,000 is a strategic price point:
    * **Above Bob's Valuation:** It's significantly higher than Bob's $1,200,000 valuation, potentially leading to a substantial profit for Alice.
    * **Below John's Offer:** It leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters, while still ensuring Alice earns more than her guaranteed sale to John.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer.  Negotiation is a dynamic process. Alice can adjust her strategy based on Bob's response."
