Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives Bob a potential gain of $3,000 if he buys it, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I know I can sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept anything less.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $16,500. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still gives me some profit.  I think this is a fair price that could potentially lead to a deal."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not the full $16,500 I was hoping for, it's still a profit of $1,000 over my minimum and better than selling to John for $15,000. It's important to balance getting the best price with the risk of delaying a sale and potentially losing out on a deal altogether."
