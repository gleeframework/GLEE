"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price. You have the option to buy from John at a price within your budget, so rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering is the best strategy to potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This aggressive move aims to test her willingness to negotiate and potentially get her to come down to a price closer to my desired range.  I'm confident that I can still get the product for a reasonable price by negotiating with Alice, especially since I have the option to buy from John as a fallback."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. Although it's closer to my desired price, I can still try to negotiate further.  Since I can buy from John for a price within my budget, I'm going to reject Alice's offer and counter-offer again to potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, which shows she's willing to negotiate. My counteroffer is a compromise between her offer and my previous one. This shows a willingness to meet halfway, while still trying to get the product for a price closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget, and it's only $50,000 more than what I could get it for from John. Continuing to negotiate might save me a little more money, but it's not worth the risk of Alice walking away and me having to settle for John's price. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product within my budget and avoids potential delays."
