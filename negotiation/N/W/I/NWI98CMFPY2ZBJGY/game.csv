"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product.  However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is cutting it a bit too close to my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,075,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $1,075,000 is close, but I need to land a bit higher.  My final offer is $1,090,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. Let me know your decision.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
