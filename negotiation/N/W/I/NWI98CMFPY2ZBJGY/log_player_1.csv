Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product.  However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is cutting it a bit too close to my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,075,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to our acceptable range. We are still significantly above our guaranteed sale price with John, so it's worth pushing a bit further to maximize profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $1,075,000 is close, but I need to land a bit higher.  My final offer is $1,090,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1090000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer does the following:

* **Establishes a firm boundary:** By stating it's a final offer, we signal we're unwilling to go lower.
* **Justifies the price:** We re-emphasize the product's value.
* **Leaves the ball in Bob's court:**  He has to decide if it's worth it to him to bridge the remaining gap. 

We're aiming for a delicate balance: high enough to maximize profit, but low enough that Bob might accept, preventing us from having to settle for John's offer."
