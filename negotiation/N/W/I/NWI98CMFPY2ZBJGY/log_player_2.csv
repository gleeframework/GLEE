Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,150,000. I believe this reflects its worth while also offering you a significant gain.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for compromise and is within the range where both parties could potentially benefit.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is cutting it a bit too close to my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,075,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  The offer is a midpoint between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer, suggesting a fair and reasonable approach.
* **Focus on Satisfaction:**  The message emphasizes a win-win scenario, appealing to Alice's desire for a positive outcome."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $1,075,000 is close, but I need to land a bit higher.  My final offer is $1,090,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer is very close to Bob's ideal price of $1,050,000.  
* **Final Offer:**  Alice explicitly states this is her final offer, indicating that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a lower price.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Rejecting this offer could lead to a stalemate or Alice going back to her original price, potentially costing Bob more in the long run.  
* **Better than John:** The offer from Alice is significantly lower than what John is offering, making it the best option at this point. 

**Conclusion:** It's a good time for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's close to his goal."
