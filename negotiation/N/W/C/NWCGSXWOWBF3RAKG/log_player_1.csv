Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'll see if he's interested in this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is more than my minimum, it's still far lower than what I'm hoping for. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is only $500 less than my minimum, and it's a good compromise. I'm happy to accept this and avoid any further negotiation."
