"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Alice to counter.
* **Significant Difference:**  Offering $9,000 creates a significant enough gap from Alice's asking price to signal that I'm serious about getting a better deal but not so low that it's insulting. 
* **Alternative Option:** I always have the option to go with John for $10,000, so I'm not desperate to meet Alice's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,500. She knows the product is worth $10,000 to me and is trying to maximize her profit. 
* Further negotiation with Alice has a low chance of saving me a significant amount of money.
* John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000, which is only $500 less than Alice's current offer. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation for such a small potential saving."
