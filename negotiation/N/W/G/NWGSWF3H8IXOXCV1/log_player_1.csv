Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but it's also a significant amount above my minimum acceptable price.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what kind of counteroffer he might make."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $15,000, which is still a good amount above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is a decent compromise. It's significantly higher than what John is offering, and I'm confident that I can find another buyer later if this doesn't work out.  I'm going to accept this offer."
