You have three options:

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference - I'll come down to $10,125. This is a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is slowly coming down in price, she's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a higher risk of ending up with a price closer to $10,000 or even slightly above. It's more efficient at this point to take the guaranteed savings with John's offer."
