"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and appreciative:** Maintains a good negotiating relationship with Alice.
* **Signals willingness to negotiate:**  We didn't go straight to John, showing Alice we're interested but want a fairer price.
* **Opens with a significant but not insulting gap:**  $7,000 is closer to Alice's valuation, giving her room to counter, but also shows we're serious about a discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still leaves you a good margin. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a price point that works for us, but we still have room to negotiate.  We'll reject this offer and propose a counter-offer slightly below her latest price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $8,000?  That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

Here's why this counter-offer makes sense:

* **Acknowledging progress:** We recognize Alice is negotiating, building goodwill.
* **Direct and to the point:** We've gone back and forth a bit, so being direct about the desired price is appropriate.
* **Targeting her valuation:**  We know she values it at $8,000, so this is our best shot at getting the lowest price. 

It's possible Alice will counter again, but this offer puts us in a strong position."
