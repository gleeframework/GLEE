"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant intrinsic value that I'm confident will benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my comfort zone. Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it while still respecting your value for it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
