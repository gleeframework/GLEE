"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product from John for less.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a good price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,500 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $12,000.  He can still get the product from John for less, so it's worth seeing if he can negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but unfortunately $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12500 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  He's already rejected Alice's offer twice and she's indicated this is her final offer.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to get the price down further, and he's running out of time.  Buying from John ensures he gets the product within his budget."
