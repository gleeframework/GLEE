"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,400,000. It's a significant value at that price, and while I'm confident in its worth to you, I understand this may be a significant investment. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,500,000, so this is your chance to secure it at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Although Alice's offer is lower than her initial asking price, it's still significantly higher than your $800,000 limit and what John is offering. You have a better alternative available."
