"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $80 at this time. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which still leaves me a fair profit. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $95 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. I've already come down significantly from my initial price, and this is my final offer before I have to consider selling to another buyer.  Let me know if we can make this happen.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $100 still falls short of what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This is truly my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer.",105.0,Alice,7,
