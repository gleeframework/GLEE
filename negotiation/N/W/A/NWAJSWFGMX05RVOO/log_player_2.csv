"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $80 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which still leaves me a fair profit. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $125 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but $95 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. I've already come down significantly from my initial price, and this is my final offer before I have to consider selling to another buyer.  Let me know if we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has lowered her price, $110 is still more than you are willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you still have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $100 still falls short of what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This is truly my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is clearly unwilling to go lower than $105.  While you could continue to negotiate, it's getting very close to your maximum price.  At this point, it's better to buy from John for $80 and save yourself the time and potential frustration of continued negotiation."
