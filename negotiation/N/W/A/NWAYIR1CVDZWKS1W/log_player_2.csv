"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe you'll find it a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring potential counteroffers. Buying from John immediately would guarantee you the product but at a higher price than you might be able to secure through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still above your desired price point. While it's closer to your budget, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to push for a lower price in the next round. Buying from John would guarantee the product but at a price that is only slightly better than Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not sure I can accept $1000000. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to your budget, but still above your desired price point. It's worth continuing to negotiate.  While you can buy from John for $1,000,000, there's a chance you can still get a better deal with Alice if you continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still struggling to reach $1,050,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  I'm confident this product is valuable, and I'm eager to add it to my collection."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not sure $1025000 is enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1025000 and my minimum price of $1200000. Let's try $1112500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to accept it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, her counteroffer of $1,125,000 is still too high. You have limited rounds left, and the risk of continuing to negotiate could lead to a worse outcome. At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product from John at a guaranteed price of $1,000,000."
