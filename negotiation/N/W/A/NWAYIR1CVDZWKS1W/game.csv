"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, but that's my absolute limit.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not sure I can accept $1000000. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still struggling to reach $1050000.  I'm willing to go up to $1025000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  I'm confident this product is valuable, and I'm eager to add it to my collection.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not sure $1025000 is enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1025000 and my minimum price of $1200000. Let's try $1112500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to accept it. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,7,
