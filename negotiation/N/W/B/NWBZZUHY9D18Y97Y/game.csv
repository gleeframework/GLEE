"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can offer you a deal at $13500. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you meet me at this price?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $13500, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we meet at $13250?",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $13250 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $13000 again. Can you meet me at this price?",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already made several concessions, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $13250. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. How about I include a premium service package worth $500, which would bring the total price to $13750? Is that something you'd be interested in?",13750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to pay $13750, and I'm not interested in the premium service package. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet on a price. My final offer is $12000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider buying the product from John for $12000.",12000.0,Bob,10,
