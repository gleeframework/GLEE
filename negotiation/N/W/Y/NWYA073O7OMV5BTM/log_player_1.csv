Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I need, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price we both agree on. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower offer, but I won't go below $1,500,000 since I have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still aiming for a bit more. I'm going to reject and counter with a price closer to $1,500,000.  If he won't budge, then I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still a fair bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my ideal price and leaves some room for potential negotiation.  If he rejects this, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm not confident I can get him to go higher.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John. This ensures I get the price I want without further negotiation."
