"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  I think it's a fair starting point that reflects the worth you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($12,000). There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your initial proposal.  However, I'm looking to get the best value possible, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is reasonable:** $13,500 is a good compromise, right in the middle of Bob's counteroffer ($13,000) and Alice's previous offer ($14,000). 
* **Saving money:** While Bob can potentially try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Limited time:**  The negotiation is limited to 10 rounds, so accepting a reasonable offer early on is a smart strategy to ensure a purchase within the time frame."
