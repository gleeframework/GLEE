"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your initial proposal.  However, I'm looking to get the best value possible, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
