Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}

Alice is being very inflexible and the price is getting too high. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  While I'd prefer to save more money,  I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing out on the product completely."
