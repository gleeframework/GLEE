"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This shows I'm confident in the product's worth and opens the door for a potential deal quickly. I'm also leaving a buffer in case I need to make concessions in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than what the product is worth to me.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility. However, I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable value. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and leaves room for further compromise if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still too low. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. It's better to risk a few more rounds than to settle for a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer again, showing continued willingness to compromise. However, I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my target value. This offer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway and see if a deal can be reached in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $830,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $830,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  While time is running out, I'm not willing to sell for less than what the product is worth to me.  The potential gain of a higher price is worth the risk of continuing the negotiation.  It's possible Bob will make a higher offer in a later round, or I can try to counteroffer and reach a deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only a few rounds remaining, I'm making a significant concession, dropping my price to $850,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about reaching an agreement. It's a high-risk move, but it increases the likelihood of a deal in this round. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm more likely to accept his counteroffer in the next round or sell to John to avoid losing out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high.  Bob's offer is only $10,000 below my minimum acceptable value.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target of $850,000, accepting this offer guarantees a sale and ensures I don't end up with nothing. It's a calculated risk, but with the time constraint, it's the most sensible choice to secure a profit."
