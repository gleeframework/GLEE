"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a significant amount of money. While I can't disclose the exact value to you, I'm confident it holds tremendous potential. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a price I've carefully considered, taking into account its potential value. If you're interested, I'd be happy to discuss it further.  If not, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to purchase it for $1500000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
