"Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  I believe that's a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",925000.0,Alice,5,
