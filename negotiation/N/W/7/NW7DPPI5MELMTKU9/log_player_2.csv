"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I should try to get the price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it leaves room for further negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about buying the product but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice met me in the middle, and $105 is a reasonable price. It's close enough to my target, and further haggling might make me lose the deal."
