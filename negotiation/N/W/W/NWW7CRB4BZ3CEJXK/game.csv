"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, as the product is worth a significant amount to me. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $10500. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I need to be honest with you, if I don't get a better price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000. I'm really interested in buying from you, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,6,
