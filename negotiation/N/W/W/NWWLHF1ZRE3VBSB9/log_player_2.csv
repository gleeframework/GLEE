"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $150,000 and still acquire the product. 

While Alice's message tries to create urgency, you have a better alternative with John."
