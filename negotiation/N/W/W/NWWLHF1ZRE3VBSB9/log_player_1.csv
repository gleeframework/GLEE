Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn an extra $150,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value, but the ""limited-time offer"" and mention of another buyer create a sense of urgency and scarcity.
* **Respecting the Bottom Line:** Offering it for anything less than $1,200,000 to Bob would be financially unwise, as you have a guaranteed buyer at that price. 

This approach balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts, you make a significant profit. If he rejects it, you still have your guaranteed sale with John."
