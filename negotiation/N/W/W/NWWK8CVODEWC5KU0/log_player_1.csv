{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts high, knowing that we can always come down in price.  It also emphasizes the value of the product and opens the door for negotiation, which is key to maximizing our profits.  Remember, we have a safety net of $12,000 with John, so there's no need to rush into a deal that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's far below our minimum value of $12,000.  We're in a strong position with John's offer, so we can afford to hold out for a better price. Let's try to counter Bob and see if we can get closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

We're sticking to our minimum value here. We're also trying to be reasonable by offering to meet in the middle. Hopefully, this will be enough to entice Bob to agree, but we're still ready to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to our minimum value, it's still below what we'd like to get.  We're still in a strong position with John's offer, so we can afford to hold out for another round of negotiation.  Let's see if we can convince Bob to come up a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm not quite at $10,500 yet, I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

We're trying to split the difference again here, hoping to reach a compromise that's acceptable to both of us.  We're also reminding Bob of the product's value in an attempt to justify our price.  If Bob still refuses, we'll have to make the tough decision of whether to accept his offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11250 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to consider $10800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiation is getting increasingly tedious, and Bob's offers are still below our minimum value of $12,000.  While $10,800 is tempting, it's not worth risking another round of negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price.  John is a guaranteed buyer at our minimum value, so it's in our best interest to accept his offer and move on."
