"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the response. I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit out of reach. How about $9,000? That would allow me to make the purchase.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $9,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",9800.0,Alice,5,
