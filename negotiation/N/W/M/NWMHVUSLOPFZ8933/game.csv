"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to find a price point that works a little better for my budget. How about we consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, $800,000 is pushing the upper end of my budget.  How about we settle at $775,000 and call it a deal?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $775,000, which would be $787,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",787500.0,Alice,7,
