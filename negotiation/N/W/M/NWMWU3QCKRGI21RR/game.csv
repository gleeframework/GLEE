"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $750000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,
