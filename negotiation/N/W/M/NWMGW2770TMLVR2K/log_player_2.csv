This counter-offer is a good starting point. It's a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation while staying well below my $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $90. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our ideal price. Let's see if we can negotiate a little further."

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

This counteroffer aims to split the difference between our previous offer and Alice's current one. It keeps the negotiation moving and edges closer to my preferred spending limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still a bit below my minimum value for the product, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $85. It's getting close to my minimum, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and I'm not willing to pay more than my $80 limit. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John, ensuring I stay within my budget."
