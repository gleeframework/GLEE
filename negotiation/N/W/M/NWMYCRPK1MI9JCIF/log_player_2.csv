{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $15,000 to me, and Alice's initial offer is $20,000.  This is too high. I will reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum price, hoping to close the deal quickly. Alice knows the product's value to me, so I'm not leaving any room for negotiation on my end."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,500 is closer to my maximum, I'm still willing to negotiate further. I believe there's room for Alice to come down a bit more. I'll reject the offer and try to reach a more agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise. $16,000 is a reasonable middle ground, and I'm hoping this will be more enticing for Alice to accept."
