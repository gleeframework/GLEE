,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. While $9,800 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and I go for $10,650? That way we're both getting a good deal.",10650.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. How about we meet at $10,300? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10300.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to keep negotiating, but $10,300 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference again and go for $10,450?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly.",10450.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $10,450 is the best deal for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about we go for $10,150? That's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",10150.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,150 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference again and go for $10,300? This is a fair price, and we can finally close this deal.",10300.0,Alice,7,
