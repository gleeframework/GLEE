"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a great deal for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10000 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's final offer of $10,000 matches my minimum acceptable price, and it's also the same amount I could get from John.  Therefore, I'll accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
