"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $140 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $100 is your maximum, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
