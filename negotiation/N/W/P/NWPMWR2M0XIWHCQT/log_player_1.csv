Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  While the product is worth $10,000 to me, starting with a higher price gives room for negotiation. $15,000 is a significant markup but not entirely unreasonable.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This first offer is as much about understanding Bob's eagerness as it is about securing an immediate sale. His response will indicate how much he values the product and how flexible he might be.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 (John) provides leverage. I won't feel pressured to accept any offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to his perceived value than mine. While it's higher than his initial perceived value of $8,000, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.  Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about the product's value while leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its true worth. To move this forward, I can offer it for $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility (but not desperation):** I've lowered my price by $2,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Hold Firm (for now):**  The $13,000 offer is still comfortably above my safety net ($10,000) and closer to my original asking price. 
* **Justification:** I've reiterated the product's value to justify the higher price. I want to keep Bob engaged while steering towards a more favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to make a new offer of $11,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $11,000 is a $1,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price and a good compromise.
* **Negotiation Momentum:** Bob is clearly interested and has progressively increased his offer. Accepting now capitalizes on this momentum and avoids potentially pushing him away.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but there's no guarantee. Accepting now secures a good profit without further delay."
