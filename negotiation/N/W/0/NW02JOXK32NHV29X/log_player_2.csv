While I can't disclose specifics about its worth to you, I can assure you it's something I hold dear and value at no less than $1500000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1750000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire something truly special.  Consider this offer carefully, as I have a backup buyer willing to purchase it for $1500000 if you decline.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.
