Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly, but not too much. Remember, you are aiming for as much profit as possible, and John is a safety net if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'd like to receive. While it's tempting to accept it, I'm going to try to push for a higher price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $9,500. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is still lower than I'd prefer, it's getting closer to my desired price.  I'm taking this offer because it's a good compromise, and it's important to remember that John is a solid backup plan if the negotiation falls apart."
