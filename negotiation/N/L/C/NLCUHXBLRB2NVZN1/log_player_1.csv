"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that's attractive to Bob while still leaving room for some potential negotiation. It's important to be bold in the initial offer, as Bob knows he can get it for less than $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I have 8 rounds remaining, and there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It lowers the price from my previous offer, but it still leaves some room for profit and stays above my minimum acceptable price. It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also won't settle for a price too far below my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit low. We're approaching the halfway point of our negotiations, and there's a good chance we can still reach a mutually agreeable price. I want to see if he's willing to go higher, so I'll reject his offer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to show good faith, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's above my minimum. It's important to maintain a balance of compromise and firmness in these negotiations."
