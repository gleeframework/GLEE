"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to start with a price of $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree it's a nice product, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. What do you say?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. $120 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $75?  That's a fair offer considering John is offering it for $80.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 was still a bit high, and I appreciate your reference to John's offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I can offer you a compromise at $110. This is the lowest I can go while still making a fair profit. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However,  $110 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can do $80, which is the same price John is offering.  This is my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I've already made concessions, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one last offer to you: $130. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",130.0,Alice,7,
