You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $115.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $110, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $110 secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely by pushing further."
