"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  My starting price is $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting high, but not ridiculously so. $175 leaves room for negotiation and still gives me a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and positive tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open Ended:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer, showing flexibility and encouraging him to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would result in a loss for me.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is too low, it shows interest. Rejecting allows me to counter and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Time is on my Side:** I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to be patient and see if Bob is willing to come up in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160.  This still allows me to cover my costs and makes it a great deal for you too.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than $120, but I'm also being flexible to reach a deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm staying positive and encouraging, hoping to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $160 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  $140 is only $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Accepting Bob's offer keeps the door open for future negotiations with him, as he seems like a potential repeat customer.
* **Time is a Factor:**  With only 6 rounds left, selling to John would be a guaranteed profit, but it would also close off the opportunity to work with Bob.

While I could potentially counteroffer again, I'm choosing to secure a sale now, especially given the time constraints."
