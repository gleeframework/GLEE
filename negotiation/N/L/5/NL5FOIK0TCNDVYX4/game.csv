"Alice, thank you for your offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm interested in the product, and I'm prepared to offer $750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this unique asset. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would allow both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think you're getting a good deal. How about we meet at $825,000? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
