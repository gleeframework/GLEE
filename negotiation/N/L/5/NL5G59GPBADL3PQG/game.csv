"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique nature and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for significant returns.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is significantly higher than what I had in mind.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm motivated to find a buyer, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Let's meet in the middle, how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on its value, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  To be frank, $700,000 is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're open to that, I'm ready to close the deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $700,000 is too low.  Would you consider $900,000? This is a significant reduction on my part and a fair offer considering the value this product represents.",900000.0,Alice,5,
