Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not giving away the product for less than $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's perceived value, so he has incentive to negotiate, but it's still high enough that you're likely to make a good profit. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** Bob knows exactly what you're offering and what he needs to do to accept.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
