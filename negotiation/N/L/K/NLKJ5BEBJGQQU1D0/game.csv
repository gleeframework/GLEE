"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $15,000. I'm open to discussing a payment plan that works for you.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to discuss, but I'd like to start with an offer of $8,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the potential benefits you'll gain.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to reach a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to the mark, I can't let it go for less than $11,500.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
