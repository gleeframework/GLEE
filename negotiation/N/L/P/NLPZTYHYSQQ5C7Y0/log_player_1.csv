"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point.  It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It also opens the conversation with a friendly and positive message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You have 8 rounds left, so there's time to see if you can get closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $150 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $175.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $160. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is a good compromise. It's above your minimum, and you still have 6 rounds left to potentially get a better price. However, there is always the risk that Bob will reject future offers, and you may end up selling to John for $150.  It's a calculated risk, but accepting this offer seems like the best strategy at this point."
