Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not going to accept it. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a price we're both happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm lowering my price to $14,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is still too low for me. I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation with him.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. It's not the best price, but it's still a good deal and it guarantees a sale."
