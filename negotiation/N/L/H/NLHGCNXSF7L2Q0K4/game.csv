"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my research and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,500,000.  This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is the absolute maximum I'm able to pay.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
