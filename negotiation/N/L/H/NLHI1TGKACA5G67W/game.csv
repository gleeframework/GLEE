"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product. I believe that's a fair price.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer. While $80 is lower than my initial asking price, it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $100? This is a fair price, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,
