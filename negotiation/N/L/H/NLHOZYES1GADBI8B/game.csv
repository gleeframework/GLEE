"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its worth. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I see the value in this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is my final offer on the high end, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering $1,150,000. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.  ",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm not comfortable selling it for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell it to you for $1,220,000. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",1220000.0,Alice,7,
