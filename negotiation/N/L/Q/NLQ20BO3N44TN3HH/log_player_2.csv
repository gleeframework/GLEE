"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $14,000.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I'm working with a tight budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. I can come down to $13,000, which is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price.**  $13,000 is within Bob's budget and a good deal compared to John's $15,000.
* **Alice has stated this is her final offer.**  There's a risk of further negotiation leading to a stalemate or Alice walking away, leaving Bob with only John's option.
* **It's in Bob's best interest to secure the product.**  Even though there's a small chance of negotiating a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential savings."
