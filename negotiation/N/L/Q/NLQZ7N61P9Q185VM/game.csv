I'm excited to offer you this valuable product! I think it's worth discussing a price of $12000. It's a great deal considering its value to you is $8000. What do you think?,12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value to you, but based on my needs, I am only willing to pay up to $9500 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8000 and I need to make a profit.",11000.0,Alice,3,
