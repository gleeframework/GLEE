"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price of $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far more than he's willing to pay. He has a better alternative with John, and should use this negotiation to try and get a lower price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your understanding, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let me know if this works for you!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need $15,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it has to you. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500.

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice's offer of $15,500 is closer to his maximum price, it's still over his budget.  John's offer is a sure thing at his desired price, and it's the best option to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
