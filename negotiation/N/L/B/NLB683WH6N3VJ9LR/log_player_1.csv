Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation isn't possible in a real negotiation, but we'll use it strategically here.** Since we know Bob values the product at $120, we want to offer a price that's appealing to him while still maximizing our profit.
* **Offering a price slightly above Bob's valuation** creates a win-win situation. Bob gets the product at a price he finds acceptable (though lower than our minimum), and we make a profit. 
* **The ""special price"" framing** adds a sense of urgency and exclusivity, encouraging Bob to accept.

**Important:** If we didn't know Bob's valuation, starting with a higher offer closer to $150 would be a better strategy. We could then negotiate down if needed, knowing John provides a safety net at our minimum acceptable price."
