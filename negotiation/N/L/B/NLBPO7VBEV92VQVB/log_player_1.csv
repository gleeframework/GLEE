Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's my guaranteed profit with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing my profit.
* **Balance with Bob's Valuation:** While $140 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's close enough that he might be willing to pay a premium if I can convince him of the product's benefits. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
