"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000, considering the product's value to you and my target profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, which is the lowest price I can accept to make this deal worthwhile for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",13250.0,Alice,5,
