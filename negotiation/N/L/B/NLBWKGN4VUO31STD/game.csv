"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll be impressed by its features. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $775,000? I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's settle on this and move forward with the purchase.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $775,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $825,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
