"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll be impressed by its features. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price. It's worth negotiating further with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $850,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price. He can likely negotiate further and potentially get a better deal. It's worth seeing if Alice will budge again."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $775,000? I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's settle on this and move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 775000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $775,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $825,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to get the price down as much as possible, but $825,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and from the price at which Bob could buy it from John. Accepting this offer is the best option in this situation."
