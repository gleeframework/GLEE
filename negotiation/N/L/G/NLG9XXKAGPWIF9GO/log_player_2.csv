Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would still be a great value for you, considering the product's worth to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
