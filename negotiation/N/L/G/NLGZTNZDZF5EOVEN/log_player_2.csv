{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to you, creating room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows you to try to get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than what the product is worth to me. This should encourage further negotiation and potentially lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still aiming for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further to see if I can bring the price down even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product. However, it's still significantly lower than her offer, and I'm hoping this will encourage her to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $980,000 is now very close to my desired price point.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that she might reject my counteroffer, and I could end up having to buy from John at a much higher price. It's better to secure this deal at a price that is still a significant saving for me."
