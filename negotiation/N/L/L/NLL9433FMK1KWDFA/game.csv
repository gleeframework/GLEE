"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,450,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
