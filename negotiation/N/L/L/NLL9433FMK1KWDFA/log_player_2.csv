You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer.  $1,750,000 is more than you're willing to pay, and you have a better option (buying from John) for less. You should counteroffer and see if you can get a better price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,450,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.

While $1,600,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You have a better option with John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
