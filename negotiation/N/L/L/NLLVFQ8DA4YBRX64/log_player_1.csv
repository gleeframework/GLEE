Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,400,000, an offer reflecting its true worth and potential. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, it's always best to try for a higher profit.
* **Understand Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.  Our starting point needs to be significantly above this to have room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By starting high ($1,400,000), but still below our minimum acceptable price, we:
    * Signal the product's high value.
    * Leave room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Alternative in Mind:**  We have the security of John's offer, so we're not desperate to accept a low price from Bob."
