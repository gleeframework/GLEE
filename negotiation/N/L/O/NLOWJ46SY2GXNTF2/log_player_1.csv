"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find really useful. I'm asking for $145 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a range that might be appealing to him. I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $145 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is just a little too low for me. How about $140? I'm really hoping to make this work, but I can't go any lower than that."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is still below my ideal price, but I'm trying to be flexible while also protecting my minimum acceptable value. I'm also emphasizing my willingness to make a deal to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $135? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm still holding out hope that we can reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but I can't go any lower than $140.  This is a fair price for a product that you'll get a lot of use out of. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm sticking with $140 for now. I'm hoping to get Bob to budge a little more, but I'm also trying to maintain a firm stance on my price.  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to agree."
