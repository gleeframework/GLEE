"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is lower than John's price, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message aims to maintain a positive tone, showing interest while also clearly stating my price limit. 
* **Strategic Goal:**  My goal is to buy the product for a price closer to Alice's value ($120) without risking her walking away from the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $110 is a bit too low for me, I'm flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice is willing to meet in the middle at $125. This is a good price for me as it's significantly lower than John's $150 offer and still leaves Alice with some profit. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice would go lower. Accepting now secures a favorable price."
