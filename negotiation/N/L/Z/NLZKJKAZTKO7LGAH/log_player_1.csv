Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation but still allows me to make a decent profit.  I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000, but I'm also prepared to lower the price if necessary, or to accept John's offer of $12,000 if Bob is unwilling to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep my budget under $15,000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting his offer allows me to sell the product quickly and avoid further negotiation."
