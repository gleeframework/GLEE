"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly unique.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $10,000? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,500. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
