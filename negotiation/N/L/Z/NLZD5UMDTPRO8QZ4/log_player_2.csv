"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly unique. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $10,000? That would be a fair compromise, I think."",

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,500. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting the $10,500 offer secures a good deal for you, as it's significantly less than John's $15,000 price and you're getting closer to Alice's perceived value."
