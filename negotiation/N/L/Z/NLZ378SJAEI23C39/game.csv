,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,600,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to lower my price slightly to $1,650,000,  reflecting the value of the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product and me to secure a reasonable return. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,580,000. I'm confident that this price is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",1580000.0,Bob,4,
