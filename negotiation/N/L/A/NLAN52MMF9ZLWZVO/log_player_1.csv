Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $900,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me a profit. If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer."

$815,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm not going to sell to John for $800,000 just yet. I'm going to see if I can get Bob to budge a little more."
