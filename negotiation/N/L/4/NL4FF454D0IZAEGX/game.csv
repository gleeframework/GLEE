"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $1200000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to be compensated fairly. How about $1350000? It's a compromise that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1300000? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
