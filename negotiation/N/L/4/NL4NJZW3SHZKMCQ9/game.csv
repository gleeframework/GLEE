"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $160 is still a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to consider $70?",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to get a reasonable price for this. How about we split the difference and say $140? This is my final offer.",140.0,Alice,5,
