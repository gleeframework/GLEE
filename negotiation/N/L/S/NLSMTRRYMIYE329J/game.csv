"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's my maximum. Can you consider that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget.  $9,800 is still a bit short of what I need. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about $10,200? I'm feeling flexible on this number, and I'm really hoping to make this deal happen.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's my final offer. Can you consider that price?",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While $9,900 is an improvement, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. Would you consider $10,000?  I think it's a fair compromise, and I really want to make this deal work.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. That's the best I can do. Can you consider that price?",9500.0,Bob,8,
