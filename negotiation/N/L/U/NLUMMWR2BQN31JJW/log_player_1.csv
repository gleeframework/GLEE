"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, as it's worth more to me than that. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to accept $88. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I think I can get closer to my minimum price if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $91?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 91}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. It seems like he's not willing to budge much further, and I'm worried that if I keep negotiating, I'll end up selling for much less than my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120."
