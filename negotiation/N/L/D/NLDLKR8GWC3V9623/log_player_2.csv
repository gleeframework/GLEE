"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially save money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. It's unlikely Alice will accept a price that is lower than her value of $12,000, but there's a chance she might accept something closer to $13,000, allowing Bob to save $2,000 compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $14,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $13,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  Offering $13,500 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still higher than her value of $12,000, making it a possible point of compromise. 
* **Focus on Value:** The message highlights Bob's interest and focuses on the value of the product for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's find a middle ground! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice has come down to $14,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. It's worth rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $13,500. There's a chance Alice might be willing to meet Bob halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $14,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob is now offering a price that is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Finality:** The message suggests a desire to finalize the deal, adding a bit of pressure for Alice to accept.
* **Value-Based:** The message continues to emphasize the value of the product for both parties."
