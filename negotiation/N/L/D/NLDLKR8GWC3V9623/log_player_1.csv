This offer gives me a good profit while still being attractive to Bob. It's a starting point, and I'm ready to negotiate if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $14,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $13,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $14,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
