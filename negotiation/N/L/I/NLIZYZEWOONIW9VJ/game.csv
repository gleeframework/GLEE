"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you: I'll sell it to you for $2000000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering me for the purchase of your product. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, based on my research and budget, I am unable to meet the asking price of $2000000. I would like to propose an alternative that aligns more closely with what I can afford. My counteroffer is $1500000. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to say that $1500000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1750000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. However, given my current financial constraints and the market value of similar products, I cannot agree to the price of $1750000. I would like to make one final counteroffer of $1600000. This is my maximum affordable price, and I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both parties.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $1600000 is still a bit too low for me. I've already compromised by offering $1750000, and I don't think I can go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll sell the product to you for $1700000, and that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I hope you can see the value in it. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I respect your decision, Alice, and I understand that we are not able to reach an agreement on the price. However, I would like to make one final attempt to acquire the product within my budget. My final counteroffer is $1650000. I hope this is a price that you can consider reasonable, given the product's value and my financial constraints.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
