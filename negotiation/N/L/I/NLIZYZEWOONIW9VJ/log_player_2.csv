Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to say that $1500000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1750000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Alice's offer:
