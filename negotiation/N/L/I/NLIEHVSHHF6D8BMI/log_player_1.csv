Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $1,100,000 anchors the negotiation high. This leaves room for potential negotiation downward while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" to subtly justify the high price without revealing your absolute bottom line.
* **Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds a touch of pressure for Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject this initial offer. Be prepared to potentially negotiate down slightly, but don't go below your $1,200,000 safety net because John provides a guaranteed sale at that price."
