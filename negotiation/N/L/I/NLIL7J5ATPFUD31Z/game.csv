"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's worth to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the potential value we both see in this deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However,  $1,300,000 is still out of my price range.  Let's find a mutually agreeable solution.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and is a reasonable compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to try and find a solution.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,150,000. This reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. Given our previous discussions, I believe $980,000 reflects a fair balance between our respective valuations. This price allows for a mutually beneficial transaction, and I'm confident it's a reasonable offer.",980000.0,Bob,6,
