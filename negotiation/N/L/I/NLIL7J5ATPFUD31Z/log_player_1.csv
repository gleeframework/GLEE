"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation theory suggests starting with an ambitious offer to leave room for bargaining. This anchors the negotiation at a higher point. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This first offer is designed to gauge Bob's initial reaction and understand how aggressively he might counter.
* **Backup Plan:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong safety net, allowing Alice to be firmer in her negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's worth to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the potential value we both see in this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below Alice's minimum ($850,000 vs. $1,000,000). While selling to John is a tempting guaranteed option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. Alice will counter in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice makes a substantial concession from $1,500,000 to $1,300,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but also emphasizing the product's value.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to a price acceptable to both parties. It's roughly halfway between Bob's offer and Alice's initial asking price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Alice avoids dropping below her $1,000,000 minimum, knowing she has the John option as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However,  $1,300,000 is still out of my price range.  Let's find a mutually agreeable solution.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Threshold:** Bob's offer is getting closer to Alice's $1,000,000 minimum. 
* **Potential for More:**  There's still a reasonable chance to negotiate a better price with Bob, especially given that he increased his offer substantially. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With six rounds left, Alice has some leeway to counter-offer a few more times before deciding whether to accept John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me to try and find a solution.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,150,000. This reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  Alice makes a smaller concession this time ($150,000) to signal she's reaching the lower end of her acceptable range.
* **Maintaining Firmness:** While moving closer to Bob's price, Alice stays significantly above his offer, reinforcing the product's value and her strong position. 
* **Encouraging a Move:** This counteroffer aims to incentivize Bob to make a more substantial jump if he's serious about closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. Given our previous discussions, I believe $980,000 reflects a fair balance between our respective valuations. This price allows for a mutually beneficial transaction, and I'm confident it's a reasonable offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but at a very slow pace. It seems unlikely he'll reach Alice's $1,000,000 minimum within the remaining rounds.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him not increasing his offer sufficiently, leaving Alice with a worse outcome than accepting John's offer. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer provides a certain $1,000,000, which is a strong outcome. It eliminates the risk of ending up with a lower price from Bob or a failed negotiation."
