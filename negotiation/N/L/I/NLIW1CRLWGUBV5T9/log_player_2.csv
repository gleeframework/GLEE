"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I know it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. If you're interested, let me know, but I do have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below the product's worth to Bob, it's still higher than John's price. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can get the product from John for $10,000, saving $1,500."
