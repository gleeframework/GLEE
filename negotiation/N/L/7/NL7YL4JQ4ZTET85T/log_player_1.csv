Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price, leaving room for negotiation. This allows for concessions and creates the perception of working towards a compromise.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a high number ($1,600,000), I'm trying to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even though he values it at $1,000,000, my initial offer aims to shift his perception upwards.
* **Knowing my Walk-Away Point:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000. This knowledge gives me leverage and confidence in negotiations with Bob. I won't settle for anything less than my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). I have the security of John's offer, so there's no pressure to accept a less favorable deal. By rejecting and countering, I can try to negotiate a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is significantly higher than what you're proposing. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential this product holds."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession from $1,600,000 to $1,450,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a firm stance on the product's value.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer aims to meet Bob somewhere near the middle ground between his offer ($1,100,000) and my initial ask ($1,600,000). 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm still aiming for a price significantly above my safety net of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,450,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me while still allowing you a decent profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and provides a profit. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob would go higher. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or the negotiations stalling."
