I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price. I know Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's a good chance he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum price and shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's also a fair price considering Bob's offer was too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Bob's offer of $13,000 is close to my desired price and is better than selling to John. I'm going to accept his offer."
