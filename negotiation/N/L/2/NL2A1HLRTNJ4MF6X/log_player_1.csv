Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $700,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest closer to $650,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $650,000.

This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 675000}"
