"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive, but there's room for improvement.**  $700,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. 
* **I want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further.**  Rejecting the offer allows me to explore if I can get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is always an option, but I'd prefer to save money if possible.**  This is my safety net if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $700,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest closer to $650,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value and market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $675,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise.**  She met me halfway, and $675,000 is within my budget and a significant saving compared to John's price.
* **Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk isn't worth it.**  While I could try to push for a lower price, there's a chance Alice will reject my counteroffer, potentially leading to a stalemate or a higher final price.
* **Time is also a factor.** I have limited rounds to close the deal. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price and avoids further delays."
