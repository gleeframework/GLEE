"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price. While $700,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects the true value of the product and represents a significant discount from my initial offer.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $785,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",785000.0,Bob,4,
