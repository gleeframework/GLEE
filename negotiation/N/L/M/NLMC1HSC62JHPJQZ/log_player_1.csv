Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob (higher than his perceived value) but also profitable for you. Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you have some room to negotiate.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can exceed your expectations. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $1,350,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The Message:** We start by highlighting the product's value to Bob and creating a sense of exclusivity and urgency.
* **The Price:**  $1,350,000 is a sweet spot:
    * It's $150,000 more than Bob's perceived value, potentially enticing him to act quickly.
    * It leaves you with a profit of $150,000 over John's offer. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We don't know how much Bob is willing to pay *above* his perceived value. This offer assumes he's open to negotiating upwards for a product he finds valuable.
* **Alternative:**  You could start with a slightly higher price (closer to $1,400,000) and leave room for negotiation if Bob counters. 

Let me know what you think!"
