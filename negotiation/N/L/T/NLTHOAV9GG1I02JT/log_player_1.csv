"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer.  While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, and I believe I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within $8,000, but I need to get at least $9,000 for this product. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident it'll be worth the investment. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given your offer careful consideration, but I still believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. Would it be possible to lower the price to $8,500? This would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. I'm willing to negotiate further, and I believe I can still get a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,500. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I respect your valuation of the product. I would like to propose a price of $9,000. This is the highest I can go while still being within my budget constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm running out of rounds and $9,000 is still a decent amount.  I'm accepting Bob's offer."
