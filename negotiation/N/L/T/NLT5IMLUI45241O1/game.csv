"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm going to need to come in lower than $12,000.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $9,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $10,500.  This is a fair price, given both our values for the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal here.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, and I'll offer you the product for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11250.0,Alice,5,
