"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's not worth paying $12,000 for a product you value at $10,000. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

While $11,000 is closer to my value, I'm still not willing to pay more than $10,000 for this product. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."

I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, and I'll offer you the product for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for you.

Alice is unwilling to come down to my price point. It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $10,000 than continue negotiating with Alice."
