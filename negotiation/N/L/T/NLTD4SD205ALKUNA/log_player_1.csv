"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll re-evaluate and adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is a decent profit, it's still below my minimum desired profit of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

I'm coming down slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm to my minimum desired profit. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not quite there.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum desired profit.  I've already rejected his counteroffer, and I don't want to risk further rounds leading to an even lower price. It's time to take the guaranteed $100 from John and move on."
