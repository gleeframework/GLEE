"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's too risky to accept at this point. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes my budget and encourages Alice to come down.  I'm leaving some room for negotiation but also making it clear I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I still have 7 rounds to get a better deal. It's possible I can get closer to my target price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. I'm trying to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise.  If she's open to negotiation, she'll likely accept this offer. If she rejects, it means she's still hoping for a higher price, and I'll need to adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but we're getting closer. I have five rounds left, so I'm willing to continue negotiating.  I want to see if I can get Alice to come down further or if she's firm on her current price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly.  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while also putting pressure on Alice to meet my budget.  We're now just $500 apart, so it feels like this offer could be a good starting point for a final deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still $2000 above my target price.  With only 3 rounds left, I'm going to try to squeeze out a better deal.  If I can't get a better price, I'll consider buying from John in the final round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer one last time, hoping to meet Alice halfway.  We're now only $1000 apart, and I think there's a good chance she'll accept this offer. If she rejects, I'll have no choice but to buy from John in the final round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is our final round. Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, but it's still $1,500 more than I'm willing to pay. I've negotiated as much as I can, and it's clear Alice won't come down further. It's better to stick to my budget and buy from John for $10,000, ensuring I don't overspend."
