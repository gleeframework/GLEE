"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,200 is a good offer, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,200, which would be $8,600. Can you consider that?",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $8,600 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,800 as a final offer. This is my absolute minimum, so I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",8800.0,Alice,5,
