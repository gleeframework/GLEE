"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $950000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. After careful consideration, we have decided to adjust our pricing based on the mutual benefits of our partnership. We would like to propose a price of $900000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount compared to the market value and provides a good margin for both parties involved. We hope this revised offer meets your expectations and looks forward to your response.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $875000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction.",875000.0,Bob,4,
