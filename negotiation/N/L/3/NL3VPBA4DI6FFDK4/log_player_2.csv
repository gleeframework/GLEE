"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  While $950000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a significant value for you.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than your ideal price. You have room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to your desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,100,000.  How about $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still giving me a significant saving."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, but that's my final offer.  This price reflects the value of this product and allows for a fair profit. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is closer to your ideal price point and still significantly less than what you'd pay John.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price without risking further negotiation or potentially buying from John at a much higher price."
