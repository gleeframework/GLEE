{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is well above your minimum of $800,000, giving you a good profit margin.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is still lower than the $1,500,000 Bob values the product at, leaving room for potential negotiation. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  By starting with a lower price than Bob might expect, you show flexibility and encourage him to engage in further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your initial offer, potentially securing a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  While $950,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a significant value for you.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1100000.  How about $1000000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still giving me a significant saving. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin. You've already lowered your price twice, and continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a price that is too low for you.  

You have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $800,000, so you can counter with a slightly higher offer to Bob, or simply accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation.  It's a risk/reward calculation, and based on your previous responses, you seem willing to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
