"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price. You can save up to $150,000 by negotiating."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This offer reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

You're still closer to John's price than Alice's.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a price closer to your goal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm still hoping to find a price closer to my budget.  Would you consider $1,075,000? This is a significant step toward your offer, and it's the best I can do right now. "", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. This is a strong offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is only willing to go down to $1,090,000.  While that's better than her initial price, it's still $90,000 higher than what John is offering.  It's more efficient to buy from John and save that extra money."
