"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,075,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and finding a middle ground is important to me as well.  How about we settle on $1,112,500? This reflects the value I know it holds and offers you a significant gain."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $1,112,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,062,500? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily moving closer to our minimum price. While his current offer is still below our desired profit margin, we have room to negotiate and he's showing willingness to compromise. We'll aim for a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect your negotiation approach. Let's find a number we can both agree on. How about $1,090,000? This keeps us moving forward and gets us closer to a deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,090,000, so how about $1,045,000? I'm trying to find a sweet spot where we can both feel good about the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,045,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,045,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting close, but Bob's offer is still undercutting our desired profit margin.  We're willing to negotiate a bit further, but we need to push him closer to at least $1,070,000 in the next round or we risk losing too much potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're nearing the finish line here, and I want to see us close this deal. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. How about we settle on $1,070,000? That's a fair offer reflecting the true value of this product."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is getting too low and he's no longer demonstrating significant movement towards our desired price point. While we could continue negotiating, we risk losing more profit with each counteroffer.  Selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees our minimum acceptable profit and avoids the risk of Bob stalling further or lowballing us in later rounds."
