"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find immensely valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, however,  $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I could consider coming down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its value while still being a good deal for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
