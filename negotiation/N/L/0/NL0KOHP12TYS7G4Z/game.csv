"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable.",11500.0,Alice,3,
