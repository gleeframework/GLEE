"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay that amount for this unique product.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $900000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's uniqueness and the value it can bring to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet at a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $975000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and the time I've invested in it. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
