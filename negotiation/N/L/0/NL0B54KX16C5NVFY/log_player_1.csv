Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it at $100, there's a chance Bob will reject it. Offering it at $90 maximizes your potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **First Refusal Incentive:**  By telling Bob you're offering it to him first at a ""special price,"" you create a sense of urgency and exclusivity, increasing the likelihood of him accepting. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $90 is a price point that's beneficial for both parties. Bob gets a $10 discount from its perceived value, and you make a $10 profit compared to selling to John."
