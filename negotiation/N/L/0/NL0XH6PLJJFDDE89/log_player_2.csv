"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worthwhile to negotiate and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, as it allows you to recover a significant portion of your value while still providing me with a great deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the value I've placed on this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is a fair price that still allows you to benefit from the purchase while also reflecting the product's worth to me. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is a step in the right direction, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. Given our previous discussions and the value I place on this product, I'm offering $9,250. This price reflects a good compromise, allowing me to purchase the item within my budget while still offering you a fair return on your investment. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,250 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250. Considering the value I've placed on this product, I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above my budget of $8,000. While we've made some progress in the negotiations, it seems like we're at an impasse.  It's more advantageous for me to buy the product from John at $8,000 rather than risk continuing negotiations and potentially exceeding my budget."
