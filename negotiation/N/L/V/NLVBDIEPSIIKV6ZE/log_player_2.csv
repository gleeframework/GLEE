Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $10,500?  That would still leave you with a good deal, and it's a price I can live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Even though Alice came down in price, we can still try to negotiate further since her offer is above our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?"", 
""product_price"": 9750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about we meet at $10,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is the best possible outcome! Alice has met your maximum budget. There's no point in trying to negotiate further or going with John, as they both offer the same price now."
