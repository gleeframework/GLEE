"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob but lower than my minimum value. This gives him some room to negotiate and makes him feel like he's getting a good deal, while still leaving me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for such a low price.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $10,500?  That would still leave you with a good deal, and it's a price I can live with."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum value, $9,750 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about we meet at $10,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
