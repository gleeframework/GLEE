"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $140. It's a great value considering its worth of $150 to you, and I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Bob should reject the offer. While $140 is less than the $150 John is selling it for, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet my valuation. I would like to propose a price of $135 for the product. This allows us to close the deal while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he might be able to squeeze out another $5, the risk of going back and forth isn't worth it.  At $135, Bob is still getting a better deal than what John is offering."
