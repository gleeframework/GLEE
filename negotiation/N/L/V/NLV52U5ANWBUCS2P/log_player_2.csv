"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $950,000
* **Your maximum price:** $1,000,000
* **John's price:** $1,000,000

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still within your budget. You can always negotiate with Alice further to see if she'll lower the price, but the best option is to reject the current offer and see if you can get a better deal from either Alice or John."
