"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $95. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",95.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $87 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, and I'll offer you the product for $92. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",92.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you at $91, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",91.0,Alice,7,
