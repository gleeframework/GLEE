{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's a bit higher than my minimum value, giving me some room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $75, which is significantly below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price to $110. This is still above my minimum value, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this price is attractive enough for him to consider, but also allows me to make a decent profit."
