Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob of its worth without explicitly stating your minimum.
* **Alternative Option:**  By indicating you will list the product publicly if Bob declines, you create a sense of urgency and scarcity.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price that's reasonable considering the product's value to him."
