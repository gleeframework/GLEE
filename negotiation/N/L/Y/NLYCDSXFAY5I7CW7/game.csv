"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $1,000,000? That's a good compromise, and it's still a great deal for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
