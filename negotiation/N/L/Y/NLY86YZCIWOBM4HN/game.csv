"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As the owner, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks Alice! I appreciate your offer. It's a great starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. How about $800,000? I believe this is still a fair price considering the value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $850,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value to you is $1,200,000. Plus, I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $850,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to $800,000. How about we settle on $825,000? This would give us both a fair deal and allow me to reach my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to work towards a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. How about we meet at $860,000? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",860000.0,Alice,5,
