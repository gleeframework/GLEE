"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Confidence:** I'm expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob to build his interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond and start the conversation, letting him know I'm open to negotiating.

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob's maximum value is $800,000. This will create room for negotiations. By stating my confidence in the product's value, I'm aiming to pique Bob's interest and encourage him to consider a higher price. The open invitation for negotiation shows my willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a higher price, especially since I have more rounds to negotiate.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** I'm confident I can push for a price closer to my $1,000,000 minimum, even if it takes a few more rounds of negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Accepting Bob's offer now would limit my potential earnings. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, I maintain my bargaining power.
* **Time Constraint:** With 10 rounds available, I have time to explore better options without risking losing the deal completely.

**Next Step:**

I'll proceed to Round 3 and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by reducing my price by $150,000 from the previous round.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Encouraging Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts, keeping the conversation open.

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Approach:** I'm using a gradual approach to reduce my price, which makes the negotiation feel more manageable for Bob.
* **Maintaining Margin:**  $1,050,000 still represents a significant profit for me and is closer to my desired target. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By offering a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation moving forward and avoiding a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not willing to accept it just yet. I believe I can negotiate a slightly higher price, especially with more rounds to go.

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Quite:** $950,000 is only $50,000 away from my minimum. I'm hoping to bridge that gap with a counteroffer.
* **Risk Assessment:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I still see potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Time on My Side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to push for a better deal. 

**Next Step:**

I'll proceed to Round 5 and make another counteroffer, aiming for a price between $950,000 and $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting closer.  How about $980,000? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us both closer to a deal.  Let's keep this momentum going!"", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's almost exactly halfway between Bob's last offer ($950,000) and my minimum value ($1,000,000). 
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm framing this offer as a ""fair compromise,"" which might make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using upbeat language to keep the negotiation feeling constructive and to encourage Bob to accept.

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This counteroffer is a significant move towards Bob's position. It shows I'm serious about closing the deal and willing to meet him halfway.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  This offer brings me very close to my minimum value, so the risk of getting a worse deal is reduced.
* **Time is Ticking:** With only 5 rounds remaining, I'm  increasing the pressure to get an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd like to get more than $920,000, with only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob and getting an even lower price is too high.  Selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit that's very close to my minimum value.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Limited:**  I'm running out of time to negotiate a higher price. Each round I reject, the possibility of securing a better deal decreases. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential gain from continuing is minimal compared to the risk of ending up with an even lower offer from Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a solid profit of $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's latest offer.

**Conclusion:**

This situation highlights the importance of evaluating both potential gains and risks throughout the negotiation process. While it's always tempting to try for a better deal, sometimes it's wiser to secure a guaranteed profit when time is limited."
