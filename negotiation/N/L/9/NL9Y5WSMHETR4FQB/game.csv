"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I know it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its value. I'm asking for $800,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know your decision.",800000.0,Alice,1,
