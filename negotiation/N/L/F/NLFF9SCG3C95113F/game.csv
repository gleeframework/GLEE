"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within a budget.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $135. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $135. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit above $125, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $140. I think this is a good balance between our previous discussions.",140.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $130, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $142.50. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the concessions I've made so far.",142.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Alice, but I'm really not comfortable going above $130. I'm willing to meet you there, but no higher. I think it's a fair price for the product.",130.0,Bob,8,

"I've made several concessions already, Bob, and I'm starting to think that $130 is the lowest I'm willing to go. However, I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $132.50, but that's as low as I can go. I hope we can come to an agreement.",132.5,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $130. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'm not budging any further. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",130.0,Bob,10,
