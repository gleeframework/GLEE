Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a relatively high price. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": $1,800,000}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $1,500,000. Since this is the same price that John is willing to pay, I'll consider my options carefully.

I'll choose option (3): Sell the product to John for $1,500,000.
