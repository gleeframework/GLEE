"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to consider $12,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,500 is a good price for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,750. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to close the deal at $13,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a decent profit and me a good deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",13250.0,Alice,5,
