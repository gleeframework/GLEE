"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it gives us both a good deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I have to consider the product's value to me, and I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
