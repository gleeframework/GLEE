"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  Since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, I have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I have to consider the product's value to me, and I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer to pay less,  $900,000 is a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting her offer saves me $100,000 and ensures I get the product I want."
