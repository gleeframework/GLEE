Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I know it's something you're interested in, and I think you'll find my price very reasonable.  I'm willing to let it go for $13,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) creates room for negotiation while still aiming for a price higher than your fallback option.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes a ""great deal"" and a ""reasonable price"" to entice Bob while avoiding a price so high it discourages him immediately. 

This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher profit than selling to John."
