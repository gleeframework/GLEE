"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great opportunity for you! I'm willing to sell this fantastic product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $100 is a decent price, you know you can get it for $120 from John if necessary. There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject her initial offer."
