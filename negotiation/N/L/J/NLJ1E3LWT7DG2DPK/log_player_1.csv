Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can leverage this to your advantage. Starting with a higher offer of $2,000,000 allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification for value:** The message emphasizes the ""incredible value and potential"" of the product, aiming to justify the high asking price.  
* **""Exclusive opportunity"" framing:**  The wording creates a sense of scarcity and desirability, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** While you have a fallback option with John, aiming too high could lead Bob to reject the offer outright. This strategy balances ambition with the knowledge of Bob's valuation and your secured alternative."
