"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for your business.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price given its potential.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth while leaving room for you to see a strong return on your investment.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,150,000 is still above what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  I believe this offer is fair, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $1,050,000? This shows my commitment to getting this deal done.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a good compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
