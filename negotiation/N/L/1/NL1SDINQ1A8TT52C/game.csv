"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget, I can only offer $12,000. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $20,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to offer $14,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
