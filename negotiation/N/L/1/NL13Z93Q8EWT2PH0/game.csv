"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let's start our negotiation with this offer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for your product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to make a reasonable profit.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
