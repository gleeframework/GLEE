"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value. I'm willing to let it go for $12,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $12,500 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and it's a better deal than buying from John at $15,000."
