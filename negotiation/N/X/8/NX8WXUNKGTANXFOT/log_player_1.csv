"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to you! I'm asking for $95, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired $95 by counter-offering. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $90? That's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to pay $87 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $87 is only $2 away from my minimum acceptable price.  It's not worth risking another round to potentially get a higher offer, especially since we're already halfway through the negotiations. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and gets me a good price."
