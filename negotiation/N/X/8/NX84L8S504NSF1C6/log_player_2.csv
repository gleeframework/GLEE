"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. You have a clear upper limit of $1,500,000 and Alice has a lower limit of $800,000, so a counteroffer could potentially save you money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still provides her with a profit margin above her minimum acceptable price.  This should encourage her to consider the offer while also giving you a substantial saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still a good deal for Bob, given that he can purchase the product from John for $1,500,000.  By accepting this offer, Bob saves $400,000 compared to buying from John. While there's still room for negotiation, accepting at this point minimizes the risk of losing the deal and potentially being forced to buy at a higher price from John."
