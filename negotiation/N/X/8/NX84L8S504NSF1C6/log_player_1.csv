Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, but still leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer that could be profitable for both of us. It's also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, giving me some wiggle room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my desired price and below what the product is worth to him. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000, which is still a good profit for me and likely still attractive to Bob considering his value for the product. This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation."
