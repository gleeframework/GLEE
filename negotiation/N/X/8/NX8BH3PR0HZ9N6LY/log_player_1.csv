I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell at that price immediately. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway,  offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a higher price."

I'm still not willing to accept a price below my minimum. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to close the gap."

I'm going to offer a price that's closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while trying to secure a better deal."

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, he might walk away entirely. To ensure a guaranteed sale and avoid further negotiation, I'll sell to John for $800,000."
