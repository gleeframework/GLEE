"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:**  Beginning significantly above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) provides room for negotiation while aiming high. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" attempting to subtly shift Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Clearly stating this is a ""starting point for negotiations"" signals to Bob that you're willing to discuss the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, your initial price is unfortunately well beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, considering its potential benefits to me. This offer is a significant step towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer, $1,100,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have plenty of room for negotiation and rounds left. Rejecting this offer signals that you're serious about a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I can come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the unique advantages this product offers and allows us both to benefit."",
""product_price"": 2000000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** You're showing a willingness to negotiate by dropping $250,000, a significant amount. However, you're staying well above Bob's offer, reinforcing the product's value.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message again highlights the ""unique advantages"" to justify the high price and potentially sway Bob's perception.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** While still a large gap, this counteroffer aims to encourage Bob to engage in more meaningful negotiation towards a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  To find common ground, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,500,000. This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to move forward with this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. There's no benefit to continuing the negotiation or taking John's offer, as they both offer the same amount.  Accepting now secures the best possible outcome for you."
