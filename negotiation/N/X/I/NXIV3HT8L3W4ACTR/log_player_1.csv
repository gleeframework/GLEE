This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,700. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think we can do better than $8,700. How about $8,400? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $200 less than my minimum acceptable price.  I'd rather sell to Bob now and avoid further negotiations, especially with the risk of him backing out or John changing his mind."
