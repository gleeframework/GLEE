"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's value of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to pay closer to my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it still leaves her with a profit.
* **Focused on value:**  The message emphasizes the ""win-win"" aspect, framing the price as a fair compromise.
* **Setting the stage:** This counteroffer sets a clear benchmark for future negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good value:** $875,000 is a good price for me, as it's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'm happy with this price, it's still higher than my initial counteroffer.  There's a possibility Alice might be willing to budge further, but there's a risk of losing the deal altogether.  
* **Time is a factor:** It's only round 3, and I want to be mindful of the 10-round limit.  Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price."
