"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $12,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit shy of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $11,000 is a more comfortable price for me. Can we discuss this further?",11000.0,Bob,4,
