"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than you'd like, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and it's still significantly less than what I'd be paying John.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal here.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to go up to $1,000,000, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
