Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but below your minimum value ($12,000).** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate but leaves you room to compromise.
* **It's a clear and concise message.** Bob understands the offer and its terms immediately.

This strategy aims to:

* **Get the negotiation started:**  A concrete offer encourages Bob to engage.
* **Leave room for bargaining:**  You can adjust the price if needed without risking losing too much.
* **Keep the option to sell to John:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can quickly move to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price ($12,000). While $8,500 is better than his initial assessment of $8,000, it's still not a good deal for you.

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Maximization:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive and potentially allows for a higher selling price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting, you demonstrate that you're not desperate for a quick sale and are willing to walk away if needed.
* **John as a safety net:** Having John as a backup buyer gives you the confidence to be assertive in negotiations.

**Next Step:**

You will now proceed to round 3, where you'll send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $9,500? This price is still a good value for you and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  This counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer ($8,500) but lower than your initial offer ($10,000). This shows you're willing to compromise, while still trying to get closer to your target price.
* **Reasoning:** You're hoping to find a middle ground where both parties can be satisfied. The message highlights the value proposition for Bob and positions the offer as a fair compromise.

**Strategy:** 

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This approach aims to reach a mutually agreeable price through progressive negotiation.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** The message emphasizes the importance of a fair deal for both parties, fostering a collaborative atmosphere.

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's response:**  He can either accept your counteroffer or reject it and make a new counteroffer.
* **Be Prepared to Adjust:** If Bob's response is still too low, you can adjust your counteroffer accordingly. 
* **Keep John in mind:** Remember that you can sell the product to John at any time for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $9500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is now very close to your minimum acceptable price ($12,000). It's a good deal for you, considering his initial offer of $8,500.

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit vs. Risk:** While you could continue negotiating and try to get closer to your desired price, there's always the risk that Bob will walk away, and you'll have to sell to John for less profit. 
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing negotiations could drag on, potentially costing you time and energy.  
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  $9,000 is a fair compromise that allows both of you to walk away satisfied.

**Next Steps:**

You've successfully negotiated a deal with Bob. You can now move forward with the sale and enjoy your profit!"
