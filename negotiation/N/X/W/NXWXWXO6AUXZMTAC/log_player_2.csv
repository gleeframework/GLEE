"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice. $90 is better than $120, but there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're starting with a counter-offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below our $120 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a price closer to $70. Let's see if we can negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $82 is closer, but I was hoping to keep it closer to $75. Would that work for you?"",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

We're nudging closer to the middle ground. This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price point that works well for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle again at $80? It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to her value for the product. It's unlikely she'll go lower, and $80 is a good price for us, well below our $120 maximum.  It's time to accept the deal."
