"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle again at $80? It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",80.0,Alice,5,
