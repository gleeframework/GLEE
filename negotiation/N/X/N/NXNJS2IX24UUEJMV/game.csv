"Alice, your offer is appreciated, but I'm looking to spend no more than $1,000,000 on this product. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
