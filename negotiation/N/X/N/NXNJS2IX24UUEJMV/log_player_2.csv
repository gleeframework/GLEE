"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than her previous one, but it's still above your budget. Since you have the option of buying from John for $1,000,000, there's no reason to accept this offer. It's worth seeing if you can push Alice further down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but it's still higher than what you are willing to spend. You have a guaranteed alternative with John who is willing to sell for $1,000,000.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as you're unlikely to get a better price from her."
