Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000, and I'm still making a decent margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $14,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500 one last time, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower. Accepting the $13,500 offer gets you the product for $1,500 less than John's price. Holding out further risks losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer anyway."
