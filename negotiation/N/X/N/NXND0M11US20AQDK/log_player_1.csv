Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at no less than $1,200,000 to me, but I'm open to discussing a fair price.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $1,500,000?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price of $1,500,000, which is higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Honesty and openness:** I'm stating my minimum value upfront to be transparent and build trust. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm highlighting the product's uniqueness and potential value to Bob.

This approach aims to initiate negotiations with a strong starting point while leaving space for flexibility and a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. Given my budget constraints, I am looking to purchase the product for a maximum of $800000. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000.  While I want to maximize my earnings, selling to John for $1,200,000 is still a viable option.  Therefore, I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints,  $800,000 is significantly below the value I need to achieve. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,200,000, which is my minimum.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.  Would you be open to considering a price of $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget but also stating my minimum value. 
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price of $1,000,000, which is halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but still protects my interests.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage further dialogue. 

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap and reach a more acceptable price without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. Considering my budget, I would be able to commit to purchasing the product at $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,200,000. However, it's closer to my desired price range and potentially a better option than selling to John for $1,200,000.  This is because, even though the price is lower, it avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower price or a stalemate.  

I'm choosing to accept the offer as it presents a balance between maximizing my earnings and minimizing risk."
