"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints,  $800000 is significantly below the value I need to achieve. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1200000, which is my minimum.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.  Would you be open to considering a price of $1000000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
