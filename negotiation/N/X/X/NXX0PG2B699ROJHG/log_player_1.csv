Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a fair compromise, and it's the absolute maximum I can offer.  Let me know if you're open to this.

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's still below what John is offering.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed sale."
