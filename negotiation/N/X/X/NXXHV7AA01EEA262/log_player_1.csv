Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm setting the price at $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering what you could gain. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob first allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,350,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message hints at the value proposition for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously. If Bob counters, there's still space to negotiate down towards a price closer to $1,000,000, which would still be a profit for Alice. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might want to start with an even higher initial price.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If there's a time constraint, Alice might be more willing to accept a lower offer from Bob to avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether."
