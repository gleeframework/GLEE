Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to consider my own profit margins. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $11,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot by offering $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I can only go as low as $11,250. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $11,250. Accepting now secures a good price without risking the negotiation falling apart and having to buy from John at the higher price."
