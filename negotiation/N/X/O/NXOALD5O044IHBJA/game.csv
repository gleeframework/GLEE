"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to consider my own profit margins. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $11,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot by offering $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I can only go as low as $11,250. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
