"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the midpoint between our valuations, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price quickly.  This also leaves room for negotiation if Bob feels it's too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  However, $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering at $85, which is still above my minimum but shows flexibility.  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That seems like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 meets my minimum acceptable price.  I'd rather close the deal now than risk losing him and having to sell to John at the same price."
