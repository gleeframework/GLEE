Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. This is a fair offer reflecting the product's value. To be candid,  $1,200,000 is the lowest I can go. I'm hoping we can close this deal.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $1,200,000.  While the product is worth more to her, it's not worth going over your $1,000,000 limit when you have a guaranteed option with John at that price."
