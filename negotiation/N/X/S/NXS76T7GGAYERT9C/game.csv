"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking to keep my spending within a budget of $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget, but unfortunately, I can't go as low as $8,000. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $9,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still aiming to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $9,500. That's a significant compromise on my end, and it's still a great price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still working within a tight budget, and I would like to propose $9,000 as a potential compromise. I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,6,
