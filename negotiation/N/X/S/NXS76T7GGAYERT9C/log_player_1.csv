{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** $10,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as an alternative buyer at $12,000 gives me a strong fallback position.
* **Negotiation:**  I expect Bob to counteroffer, and I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking to keep my spending within a budget of $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to cave to his initial offer. I believe there's still room to reach a price that's better for me.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale for $12,000, so I'm not desperate. 

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget, but unfortunately, I can't go as low as $8,000. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $9,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By offering $9,000, I'm showing willingness to compromise while still keeping the price higher than Bob's initial offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  I emphasize the value Bob will receive, encouraging him to see the worth beyond the price. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if needed, but it's still closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still aiming to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:**  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **John's Offer:** With John waiting in the wings to buy for $12,000, I have a strong safety net. I don't need to settle for a price that's too low.

**Next Step:** I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $9,500 or $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $9,500. That's a significant compromise on my end, and it's still a great price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $9,500 is a compromise, but it keeps the price closer to my desired range.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the price in relation to the benefits.
* **Final Push:**  This counteroffer is a final push before I seriously consider accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still working within a tight budget, and I would like to propose $9,000 as a potential compromise. I believe this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting close to my desired range. While it's not my ideal price, it's a significant improvement over his previous offers.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject his offer, there's a chance he might walk away, and I could end up selling to John for $12,000, losing out on the opportunity for a quicker sale. 
* **Time Factor:** Continuing to negotiate could drag things out. It's better to accept a slightly lower price than risk losing the deal entirely."
