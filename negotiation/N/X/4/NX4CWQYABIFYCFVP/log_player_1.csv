""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500.  I know it's valuable to you and this is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

This offer considers a few things:

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $8,000 to John, so that's your fallback.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering it at $9,500 aims to maximize your profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept. 

This leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, but ensures you get a significant portion of the value even if he declines."
