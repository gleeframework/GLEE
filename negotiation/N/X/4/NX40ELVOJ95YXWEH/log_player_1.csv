Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this product for the excellent price of $1,100,000. I believe it represents a significant value and will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a strong offer slightly below my walk-away price ($1,200,000 from John) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Positive Language:** My message emphasizes value and encourages Bob to see the product's worth. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility while keeping the option to negotiate down or accept John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you're providing. However, I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below both my initial asking price and my guaranteed offer from John. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price that keeps me above $1,000,000 but shows some flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is reasonable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($950,000) and my previous price ($1,100,000). It shows flexibility on my part while still striving for a strong profit margin.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to keep Bob engaged and potentially justify the higher price point.

I'm balancing my desire for a high sale price with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and the value of the product. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 to reach a compromise. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a strong compromise. While I could potentially push for a bit more, here's why I accept:

* **Significant Profit:**  $1,000,000 is a $200,000 profit margin, which is substantial.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations risks alienating Bob and potentially losing the sale altogether. John's offer is secure, but this deal represents a good balance of profit and certainty.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids further delays and allows me to re-invest the earnings sooner. 

Overall, accepting $1,000,000 is a smart business decision, even if it means leaving a little potential profit on the table."
