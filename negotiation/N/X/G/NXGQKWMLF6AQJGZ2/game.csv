,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $190 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be happy to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's a steal for this quality!",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? That's a fair price for both of us.",137.5,Bob,4,
