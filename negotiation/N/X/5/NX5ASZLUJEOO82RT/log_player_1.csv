Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** $100 is a 25% markup from your minimum acceptable price. It allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes value to Bob rather than focusing solely on the price. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $100. You might have to adjust your price lower in future interactions if he rejects this initial offer."
