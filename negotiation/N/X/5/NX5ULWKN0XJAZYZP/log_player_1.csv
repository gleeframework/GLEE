"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a strong starting point to see if Bob is seriously interested and to leave room for negotiation. It's also important to remember that I have a safety net with John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and see if we can find a more reasonable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while leaving space for further compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. Although I'm getting closer to a deal, I'm not willing to accept a price that low. I'll continue negotiating in hopes of finding a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, and it's closer to Bob's last offer.  I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to me and the potential for closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to accept it yet.  I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm countering with $1,450,000.  This is a small concession from my minimum, but I'm still confident in the value of the product. I believe this offer is close enough to Bob's last offer to entice him to accept. If not, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000."
