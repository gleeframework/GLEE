"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $180. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it!",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120. Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $130. It's still a good deal for you, and it's the most I can afford.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet at $135? It's still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay, but it's closer to my minimum price.",135.0,Alice,5,
