Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $120, aiming for a good profit.  I'm confident Bob might be willing to pay a bit more since the product is worth $100 to him. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd rather sell than have the product sit, I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a reasonable middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It also gives me a profit while remaining within a range that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get $105, Bob is stubbornly holding out.  At this point, John offers a sure thing, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob for a mere $5 difference. It's time to sell to John."
