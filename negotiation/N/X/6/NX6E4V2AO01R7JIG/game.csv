"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $15,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? ",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $9,500?  That's a fair compromise in my opinion.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $9,500 still isn't close enough to my minimum.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $10,500 is the lowest I can go.  Let's make this work.  This offer is only good for this round, so please consider it carefully.",10500.0,Alice,5,
