I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value of $100, while still potentially being attractive to Bob.  We'll see if he's willing to pay this much. If he rejects, we can start negotiating!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

$80 is far too low for me. It's below my minimum value of $100. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

I'm counter-offering at $120. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise from my initial offer of $150. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum value of $100, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my target price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for something higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $105.  This is a compromise, as it's only $5 above my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable final offer considering Bob's previous bids.  Hopefully, he'll accept and we can finalize the deal."
