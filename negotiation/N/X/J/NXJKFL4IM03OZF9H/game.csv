,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1500000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it priced closer to $1200000 to make it work for my budget. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a fair profit. Would you be willing to consider $1350000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1350000 is still a little outside my comfort zone.  How about we split the difference and I take it for $1275000? I'm really serious about this product, and I think this price makes sense for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to give up on the extra $75000. I can offer you a compromise at $1300000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
