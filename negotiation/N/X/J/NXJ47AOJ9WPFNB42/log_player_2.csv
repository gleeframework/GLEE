"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500. It's a great deal and I think it's worth every penny! Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to John for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price and you know John will sell it for less.  It makes the most sense to buy directly from John for $8,000."
