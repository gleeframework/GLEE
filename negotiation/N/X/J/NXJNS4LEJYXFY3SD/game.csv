"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,025,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,025,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $1,037,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
