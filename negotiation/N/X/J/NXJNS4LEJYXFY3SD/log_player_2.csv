"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above his maximum budget. He can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John.  Rejecting the offer allows him to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by making a bold move. He knows the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, but he's aiming for a significant discount. Offering $950,000 is a strong opening counteroffer, leaving room for some back-and-forth negotiation.  He's also emphasizing his budget constraints to try and push Alice towards a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is tempting, he can still get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, giving him a chance to potentially secure a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,025,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to be strategic. He knows Alice is motivated to sell, and he's using that to his advantage. By offering a price halfway between Alice's last offer and his desired price, he's showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,025,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $1,037,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,037,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,037,500 is close to Bob's budget. However, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. He knows that he can get the product from John for $1,000,000.  Therefore, it's more advantageous for him to buy from John and secure the lowest possible price."
