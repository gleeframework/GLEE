"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a steal for something of this value. I'm confident you'll see the potential here. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,000,000) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's worth and using persuasive language to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining a strong opening position. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a fallback option, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price given my needs. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $750,000 is below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** I'm not willing to accept his offer, but I do see potential for negotiation.  
* **John as Safety Net:** I still have John as a backup, so I have the luxury of rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to drop the price to $900,000. This gives you a significant discount and me a fair price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Flexibility:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's price while still staying above my minimum.
* **Appealing to Logic:** I'm presenting the $900,000 price as a ""middle ground"" solution, making it seem like a logical compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product by highlighting the ""significant discount"" Bob would be receiving.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation by asking ""What do you say?"", keeping the conversation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a lower price. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $825000 for this product. This is a fair price considering my needs and your flexibility. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is above my minimum threshold of $800,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:** While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  there's a good chance that further negotiation with Bob could lead to an even better deal.
* **Avoiding John:** By accepting this offer, I avoid selling to John for $800,000, leaving me with a potential for higher profits with Bob.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer provides a good starting point and keeps the negotiation going."
