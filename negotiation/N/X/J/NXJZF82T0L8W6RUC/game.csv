"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to drop the price to $900000. This gives you a significant discount and me a fair price. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a lower price. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $825000 for this product. This is a fair price considering my needs and your flexibility. What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,
