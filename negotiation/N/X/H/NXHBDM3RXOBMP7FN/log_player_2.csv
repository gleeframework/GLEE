{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and entering the next round for a counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still higher than his comfortable spending limit. Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate and should continue pushing for a lower price. There are still rounds available, so rejecting the offer and continuing to counter-offer is the most logical choice."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Bob has shown his willingness to negotiate and is confident that he can get a better price.
