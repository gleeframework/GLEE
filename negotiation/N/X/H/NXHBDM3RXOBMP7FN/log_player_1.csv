"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,100,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This will hopefully motivate Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value. There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering at $1,000,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but it's still above Bob's current offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. This should encourage Bob to make a more substantial counter-offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I've already shown flexibility by lowering my offer, and I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer. With 6 rounds left, I have time to see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering at $950,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate.  It's still above Bob's current offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. This should hopefully encourage Bob to meet me halfway and close the deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $925,000 is getting close to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher offer. With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to settle for a price that's too low.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make one final counter-offer. This will hopefully push Bob to meet my final price or risk losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering at $940,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise, but still not giving in completely. With only 3 rounds left, this is likely my final counter-offer. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll be forced to choose between his final offer or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob. He's consistently refusing to go higher than $930,000, which is still below my desired price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, so it's the most logical and profitable choice at this point."
