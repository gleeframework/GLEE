Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, aiming slightly higher initially allows room for negotiation or a quick sale above Bob's perceived value.
* **Staying strategic:**  Offering the product at $140 is still a significant markup from Bob's $120 valuation. There's a chance he might find the deal attractive enough to accept.
* **Backup plan:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always fall back on selling to John at your desired minimum price."
