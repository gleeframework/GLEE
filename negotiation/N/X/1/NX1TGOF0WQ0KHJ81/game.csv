"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob.  I'm confident this product will bring you a significant return, well beyond the $12,000 mark. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your confidence in the product, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?",12500.0,Bob,4,
