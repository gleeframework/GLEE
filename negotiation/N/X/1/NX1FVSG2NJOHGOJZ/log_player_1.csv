"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. It's also a significant amount above my minimum, which will hopefully encourage Bob to consider the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and my minimum. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still at his minimum price. I'm not convinced he's truly interested in paying more.  I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a slightly higher price, hoping to find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm dropping my counteroffer to $1,300,000. This is a small decrease, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price without risking him completely walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $1,250,000. This is only $50,000 above my minimum and with only four rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to accept his offer now rather than risk getting a lower price in the future."
