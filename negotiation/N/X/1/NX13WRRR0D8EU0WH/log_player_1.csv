"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. Bob's offer is a bit too low for my liking, and I think I can potentially get a better price. I'm going to try and counter his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise that still leaves me a bit of profit while showing Bob that I'm willing to be flexible. I hope this will encourage him to come up a bit higher in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to what I'm hoping to get, and we're already halfway through the rounds.  While I'd love to get more, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn.  I'm going to accept his offer."
