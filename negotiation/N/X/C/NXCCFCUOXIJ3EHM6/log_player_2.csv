Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $700,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $650,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to the price you're comfortable with. However, $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $620,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $615,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?

It's getting risky to push further. Alice seems firm on her price, and while I could try for a slightly lower amount, there's a good chance she won't budge and I'll end up with John's offer anyway. Accepting $615,000 secures a significant saving compared to John."
