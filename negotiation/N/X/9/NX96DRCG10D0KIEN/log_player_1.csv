Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be valued even higher.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects it, you can gradually lower the price, ultimately still aiming for a price above your minimum of $120. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The fact you have a guaranteed buyer at $120 provides a safety net. You don't *need* to go below that price.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening move. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
