"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you'll be getting a valuable product at a fair price, and I'll be able to make a good profit. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $7,500? I really think that's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
