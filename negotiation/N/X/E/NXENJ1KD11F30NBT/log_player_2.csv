"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate for a better price, but I won't go above $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Leaving Room:** I know Alice values the product at $80, so there's a potential agreement zone.
* **Polite and Direct:** I want to maintain a positive negotiation tone while being clear about my price expectations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $65 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but $85 is still above my target. I'll counter with a price closer to her value, but I'm prepared to walk away if she doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about $75? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to move towards a deal, but not by a large amount.
* **Targeting Her Value:**  I'm getting closer to her known value of $80, aiming to secure the best possible price without pushing her away.
* **Maintaining Friendliness:**  I want to keep the negotiation amicable and solution-oriented."
