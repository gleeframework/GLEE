Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is your top budget, but I'm still looking to get a good deal for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,500. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the product you want.
