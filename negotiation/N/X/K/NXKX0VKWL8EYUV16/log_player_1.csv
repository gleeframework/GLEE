""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your portfolio, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a time-sensitive offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob first is ideal. It avoids potential delays and guarantees a sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * Bob gets the product for $150,000 less than its value to him.
    * Alice makes a $150,000 profit over her minimum acceptable price. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning other interested parties and framing the offer as time-sensitive, Alice increases the perceived value and encourages Bob to act quickly."
