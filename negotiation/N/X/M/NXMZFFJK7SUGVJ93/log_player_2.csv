# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,900,000 represents the high end of my expectations,  $1,300,000 falls quite short.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $1,650,000?

While $1,650,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price.  Rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer gives Bob more leverage to reach a more favorable price."
