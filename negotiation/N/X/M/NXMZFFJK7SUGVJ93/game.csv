"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to me, while still allowing you a respectable profit.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,900,000 represents the high end of my expectations,  $1,300,000 falls quite short.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,650,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  Let's try to bridge the gap further.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This would allow us both to reach a mutually agreeable price.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
