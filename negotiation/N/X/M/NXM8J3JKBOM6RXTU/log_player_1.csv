{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $20,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe it would be a great addition to your collection.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but not so high as to be immediately rejected. It gives you room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $15,000 is my minimum, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $17,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17500 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, $16,000 is close enough to my target and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially lowering the price or having to sell to John for a lower amount."
