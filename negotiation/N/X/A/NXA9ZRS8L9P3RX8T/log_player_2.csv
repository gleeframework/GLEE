"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is still a significant amount above your desired price range. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** Alice recognizes the product's value to you, indicating she's open to bargaining. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback.** While you'd rather get a better deal, buying from John is a guaranteed option if you fail to negotiate with Alice. 

By rejecting the offer, you can try to secure a lower price through counteroffers."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $850,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product at $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.**  While it's closer to your target price, $900,000 is still a significant amount above what you want to pay.
* **There's still room to negotiate.** Alice is clearly willing to bargain, but she's also showing a willingness to compromise. This suggests you can likely get the price down further.
* **Buying from John is a safety net.** You're comfortable with the alternative of buying from John, so there's no need to rush into an agreement with Alice if you don't feel the price is right.

By rejecting the offer, you can continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  You can also point out that Alice's counteroffer is still above her stated value of $800,000, suggesting there might be more room for compromise."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $875,000. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering the product at $925,000. This price still reflects the product's value and your budget, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is getting closer, but it's still too high.** You're aiming to save as much as possible, and $925,000 is still a significant amount above your desired price range.
* **The negotiation is starting to stall.** Alice is clearly not willing to budge much further, and continuing to counteroffer may just lead to more back-and-forth with no real progress. 
* **Buying from John offers a known cost.** While you'd prefer to pay less, buying from John provides certainty and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not lead to a better deal.

At this point, it's more cost-effective and efficient to buy from John, even though it's not the ideal price. This minimizes the risk of further negotiations dragging on and ensures you get the product without further delays."
