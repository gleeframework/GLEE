Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering my budget and the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,500,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Bob's offer now matches what John is offering. It's better to secure the deal now at the same price rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
