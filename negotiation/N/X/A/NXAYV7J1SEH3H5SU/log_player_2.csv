# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to push the price down further. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,500,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
