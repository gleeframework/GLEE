To move forward, I'd be willing to accept $1,450,000.  This reflects my position while acknowledging your interest.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,200,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
