Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm initially offering it at $14,000."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm aiming high to establish a strong starting point and provide room for negotiation.  While the product is worth $10,000 to both of us, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives it as highly valuable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $14,000 offer allows for me to potentially come down in price while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will also help gauge Bob's level of interest and willingness to negotiate. His response will inform my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too steep for me. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $10,500 is tempting as it's above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I started high, and he countered reasonably, indicating he's interested. By rejecting and countering, I signal I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product above his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This strategy often feels fair to both parties and can help move negotiations along more smoothly.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The $12,000 price point ensures I remain well above my $10,000 minimum while still offering a significant discount from my initial offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge Bob's flexibility. If he accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, I can assess whether to negotiate further or take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is a full $1,000 above my minimum acceptable price, making it a good deal.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more from Bob in further negotiations, the potential gains are relatively small compared to the risk of him walking away. 
* **Secure the Sale:** Accepting now guarantees the sale and avoids the possibility of Bob lowering his offer or me having to settle for John's $10,000."
