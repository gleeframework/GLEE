"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too steep for me. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
