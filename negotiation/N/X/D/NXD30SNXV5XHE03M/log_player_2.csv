"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you working with me. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to go down to $10,000? That would make it a much more appealing deal for me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,000 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and still within Bob's budget.  While he could try for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer, leaving him with only the option to buy from John at a higher price.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sensible choice."
