"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I believe it would be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, you can potentially get it for less. You have a clear goal of saving as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $120. Would you be willing to work with me on that?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  At $130, you're still saving money compared to John's offer, and you're getting closer to your ideal price of $120. It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and potentially risking a higher price later."
