"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $7,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $7,000, so I'll sell the product to you for $8,500.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're really close now. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $7,750? That's a fair compromise between our two positions.",7750.0,Bob,6,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,750, so I'll sell the product to you for $8,125.",8125.0,Alice,7,
