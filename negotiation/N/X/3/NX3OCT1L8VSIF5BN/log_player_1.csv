"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to gauge Bob's interest. $1,500,000 is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob rejects this, I can then adjust my offer based on his response. 

**Key Considerations:**

* **Unknown Value to Bob:**  I don't know Bob's perceived value, so I'm taking a calculated risk with a high opening offer.
* **Ten Rounds:**  I have limited negotiation rounds, so I need to be strategic to maximize profit.
* **John's Offer:** I have a safety net with John's $1,000,000 offer, which allows me to be more aggressive in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm rejecting his offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round. 

**Key Considerations:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's counteroffer shows his interest in the product, but I'm confident I can push for a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Remaining Rounds:** I still have 8 rounds left, which gives me time to negotiate further.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a safety net, I'm aiming for a more profitable outcome with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a counteroffer that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a strong position. 

**Key Considerations:**

* **Balancing Positions:**  My counteroffer attempts to meet Bob halfway, potentially leading to a quicker agreement.
* **Remaining Rounds:**  I have 7 rounds left, so I need to keep moving towards a deal while not giving away too much.
* **John's Offer:** I'm still aiming to get more than John's offer, but this counteroffer provides a good balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle yet.  I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm rejecting his offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round. 

**Key Considerations:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe Bob is genuinely interested and willing to negotiate further.
* **Remaining Rounds:**  I have 6 rounds left, which is still enough time to close a better deal.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is a fallback, I'm aiming to get closer to my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm decreasing my offer again, but only slightly. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, while still remaining above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping to reach a middle ground and secure a deal before the rounds start running out. 

**Key Considerations:**

* **Negotiation Progress:** Each round, we're getting closer to a deal.
* **Remaining Rounds:** I have 5 rounds left, so time is becoming a factor.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a fallback, I'm still aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm running out of time (only 4 rounds left) and the negotiation isn't progressing as quickly as I hoped.  Given the risk of further rejection and the potential for a deadlock, I'm choosing to accept John's offer to secure a guaranteed $1,000,000.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is high.
* **John's Offer:** This offer guarantees my minimum desired profit.
* **Uncertain Outcome with Bob:**  It's uncertain if Bob will accept any further counteroffers, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
