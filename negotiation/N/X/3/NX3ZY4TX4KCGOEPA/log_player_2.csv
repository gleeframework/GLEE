"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but I was hoping for a price closer to $750,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price down significantly. It's a starting point for further negotiation, and we'll see how Alice responds."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm fully comfortable with. Let's counter-offer again and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $800,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

```

We're splitting the difference here to try and find that sweet spot. This offer shows Alice we're serious but still want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to meet in the middle, and $825,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's a significant savings compared to John's offer, and further haggling might not yield a much better result."
