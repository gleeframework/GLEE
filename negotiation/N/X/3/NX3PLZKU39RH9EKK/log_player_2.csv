"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a special price of $14,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only justify a price closer to my valuation. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's still above our maximum budget and John's offer. We have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting both our valuations."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate further, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $10,500. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the value you place on the product and the price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $10,500, which is already higher than John's offer. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at the best guaranteed price from John."
