Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000

At this point, Alice is coming down in smaller increments and we're getting close to her likely bottom line.  While I could try to push for another $25,000 discount, there's a risk Alice will dig in, and the potential savings isn't worth the risk of ending up with John's higher price."
