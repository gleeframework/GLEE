"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you think the product is pricey, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm making a new offer of $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm making a new offer of $17,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm not willing to go any lower than $17,000, and I'm starting to consider other options.

"I've made several concessions, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $17,000. Your latest offer of $15,200 is still too low, and I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle.
