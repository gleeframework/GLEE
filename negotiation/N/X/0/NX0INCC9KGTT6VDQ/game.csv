"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the return on investment you'll experience.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a significant premium for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000.  This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This shows I'm serious about acquiring the product, but we need to find a price point that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show you I'm also willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle at $887,500. This is a very fair offer considering the product's value.",887500.0,Alice,5,
