# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more expensive than John's offer of $800,000. Since your goal is to save money and John is offering the product within your budget, buying from John is the most financially sound decision."
