"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $750,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
