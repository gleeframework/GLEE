,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $130? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit high for me. How about $125? I'm really close to my budget and that's the absolute maximum I can afford right now.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $127? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for the product.",127.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $127 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $122.  If we can close the deal at that price, I'm ready to buy.",122.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $122 is getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to sell it to you for $126. It's the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for the product.",126.0,Alice,7,
