"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in! It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll reject the offer. The product is worth at least $100 to Alice, but I'm not sure what it's worth to me. If I buy it from Alice for $120, I might be overpaying. I'd rather see what John has to offer.
