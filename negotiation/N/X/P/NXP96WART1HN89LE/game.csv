"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product.  However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, given its value to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I see in this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.  What are your thoughts?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,225,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a bit off.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,162,500? This feels like a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",1162500.0,Bob,4,
