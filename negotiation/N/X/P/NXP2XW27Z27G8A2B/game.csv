"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a fair price, it's a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can agree on.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your offer and while I appreciate the reduction, I still feel there's room for negotiation. Could you possibly bring the price down to $8,750? I believe this would be a mutually beneficial price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
