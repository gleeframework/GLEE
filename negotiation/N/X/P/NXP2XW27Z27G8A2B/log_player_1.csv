{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're comfortable selling for $8,000, so this leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so he has incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a fair starting point:**  This leaves room for both of you to find a mutually agreeable price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the deal, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Could you consider reducing the price to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is a decent offer, it's still below your desired selling price. You're willing to sell to John for $8,000, but you'd rather get closer to your initial asking price of $9,500. You have room to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a fair price, it's a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can agree on."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a higher price:** You want to stay above $8,500 but acknowledge Bob's position.
* **Offer a compromise:**  Meeting halfway shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight the value:**  You reiterate that this is a good deal for Bob. 

This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation, but it also shows Bob that you're serious about getting a good price for your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your offer and while I appreciate the reduction, I still feel there's room for negotiation. Could you possibly bring the price down to $8,750? I believe this would be a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you'd ideally like to get closer to your initial $9,500 asking price, Bob's counteroffer of $8,750 is a good compromise.  It's very close to your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a slightly higher price. 

Since you have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay $8,000, it's better to accept Bob's offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price."
