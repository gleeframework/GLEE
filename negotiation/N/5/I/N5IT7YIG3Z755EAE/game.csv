"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price significantly lower than its true market value. I understand its worth to you is $800000, and I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. This represents a substantial savings for you while still allowing me to secure a fair return on my investment. Please consider this offer carefully, as I have other interested buyers lined up.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
