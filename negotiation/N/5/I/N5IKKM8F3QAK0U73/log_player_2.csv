"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product for sale. I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $95. This is a decent price, but Bob can likely get a better deal. 
* Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already given you a discount from the initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $90 is a good compromise. 
* Bob values the product at $100, and Alice is willing to sell it for $90, which is a good deal for both parties.
* Buying from John for $100 would be more expensive.
* While Bob could continue negotiating, there is a risk that Alice will walk away or John might increase his price.  It's better to secure a good price now."
