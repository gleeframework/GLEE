"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is significantly below my asking price. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but my absolute limit is $12,000. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might have to look elsewhere.",12000.0,Bob,4,
