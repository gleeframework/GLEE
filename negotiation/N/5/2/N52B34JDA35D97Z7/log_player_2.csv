"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,000,000 but below John's price of $1,500,000.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the significant benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still above your target price of $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better deal by making another counteroffer.  While John's price is higher, you want to exhaust the negotiation with Alice before resorting to that option."
