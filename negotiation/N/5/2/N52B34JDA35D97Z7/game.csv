"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the significant benefits you'll gain.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,275,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
