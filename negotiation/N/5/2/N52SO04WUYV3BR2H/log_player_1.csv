Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. Given my budget constraints, I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's in our mutual interest to close this deal.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the value of this product, $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This price acknowledges the product's worth while remaining within my financial limitations.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, holding out for the full $1,000,000 from John is the best move at this point. It minimizes risk and guarantees I get the minimum amount I value the product for.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has uncertain outcomes and could result in settling for less."
