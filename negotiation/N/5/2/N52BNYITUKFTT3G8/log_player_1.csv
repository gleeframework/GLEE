{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer to make it more appealing to Bob, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not happy with it. I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm offering a price that's right in the middle of my minimum value and Bob's last offer. This should make it more tempting for him to accept while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. There are only a few rounds left, so I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to try one more time to push for a higher price before considering selling to John. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that we are nearing the end of the negotiations and might be more willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

There are only two rounds left and Bob's offer hasn't changed.  I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob, so I'll take John's offer of $15,000.  This ensures I get my minimum value and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
