Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer gives me a significant profit, but it's still lower than Bob's perceived value, making it more likely he'll accept.  It also leaves room for negotiation if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  I can go up to $12,800, but that's really the best I can do.  It's a fair offer considering the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $12,800 is a good deal considering the risk of continued negotiation.  It's also significantly better than selling to John for $12,000."
