"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $12,500?"",
""product_price"": 12500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:** We start with an offer lower than Alice's asking price but still significantly above her perceived value ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a good deal. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** The message is framed politely and expresses interest while explaining the counteroffer is due to budget constraints. This approach can encourage Alice to continue the negotiation. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** We haven't forgotten John's offer. If Alice doesn't budge enough in subsequent rounds, we can always walk away and take John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is meeting us in the middle, but we're still significantly closer to her valuation than ours. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice.  I can go up to $12,800, but that's really the best I can do.  It's a fair offer considering the market."",
""product_price"": 12800
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're showing willingness to negotiate by increasing our offer, but we're keeping the increment relatively small ($300). This signals that we're reaching our limit.
* **Market Justification:** By mentioning the ""market,"" we subtly remind Alice that other options might be available without explicitly threatening to walk away.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The tone remains polite and understanding, but the message conveys that we're reaching a point where further concessions might not be possible."
