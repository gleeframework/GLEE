"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $850000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $750000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $750000 is a significant compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $825000. It's a fair price for a product of this value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly unique.",825000.0,Alice,5,
