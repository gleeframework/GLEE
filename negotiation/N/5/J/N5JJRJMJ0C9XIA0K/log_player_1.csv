Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll appreciate its value."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $175, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Messaging:**  I'm framing the offer positively, emphasizing the value of the product and the potential ""deal"" for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth that could potentially lead to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Safety Net:**  I have John as a backup buyer at $150, so I'm not risking losing too much if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, indicating a chance to negotiate a higher price in a subsequent round.
* **John is a reliable backup:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can sell to John for $150, guaranteeing a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer of $140 is halfway between my initial offer of $175 and Bob's offer of $120. This shows a willingness to compromise and could make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Maintaining a profit:**  $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I'll make a profit. 
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product and using positive language like ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to agree.
* **Opening for negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for further negotiation, but I'm setting a clear minimum price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $130 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited negotiating room:**  While Bob has shown interest, his offers are consistently below my minimum, suggesting further negotiation might not yield a better price.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  Selling to John for $150 ensures a profit and eliminates the uncertainty and potential risk of continued negotiation with Bob."
