"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still close to my maximum. There's potential to negotiate further and save some money.  I want to see if Alice is willing to come down further before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $100,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal. I believe this is still within a reasonable range, and it gives her some room to negotiate while still allowing me to save a considerable amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm not ready to settle for $900,000 just yet.  I'll try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a smaller counteroffer this time, only $25,000 less than Alice's previous offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still pushing for a better deal. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a fair midpoint and accept it, as it saves me a significant amount compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer to get the product for less, Alice has moved closer to my previous offer.  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of going back and forth further increases the chances of us failing to agree.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer secures me the product at a price that's still a significant saving compared to John's price, and the negotiation is likely to continue for a while longer."
