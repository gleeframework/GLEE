"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $7200. This is my final offer, so I hope you can consider it.",7200.0,Alice,7,
