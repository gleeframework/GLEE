"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Can you consider this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $825000. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you $800000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me halfway. I can offer you $795000, which is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options.

"Bob, I'm starting to get frustrated with the back-and-forth. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one final offer: $795000, and that's it. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to walk away from the deal. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,9,
