Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $1,100,000 is a bold move, but it's within the range where both parties could potentially find a compromise. This counteroffer sets the stage for negotiation and potentially leads to a more favorable outcome for Bob."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still higher than his ideal price.  There's a chance that Alice might be willing to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to explore a lower price.  However, if the next few rounds don't produce a better deal, Bob should be prepared to buy from John to avoid exceeding his budget."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing flexibility but remaining below Alice's latest offer. This is a strategic move to gauge if Alice is willing to compromise closer to Bob's desired price point. If Alice rejects, Bob will need to assess whether to continue negotiating or switch to John."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still too high for him. With only three rounds left, the risk of further negotiation not yielding a better price is high. Bob has reached a point where the potential savings are not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely.  Switching to John guarantees Bob the product within his budget, even if it's not the absolute lowest price."
