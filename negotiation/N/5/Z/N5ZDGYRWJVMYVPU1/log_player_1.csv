Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer at $120 provides a safety net, ensuring you won't be forced to go below your minimum."
