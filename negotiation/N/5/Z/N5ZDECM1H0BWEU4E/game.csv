"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly more than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. This offer reflects the value I see in the product and my sincere interest in acquiring it.  Please consider my counteroffer.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value to you.  However, my original asking price reflects the significant value it holds, and I'm confident in its potential to deliver even greater returns.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial adjustment, and I believe it represents a fair offer considering the unique benefits this product provides.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my reach. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000. This reflects the maximum value I'm able to see in the product at this stage. I hope you'll consider this counteroffer and find it a step in the right direction.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
