"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my maximum budget.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping to find a price closer to my budget. I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000.  This ensures he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation that may not yield a better outcome."
