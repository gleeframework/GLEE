"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. Offering $13,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for compromise and allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price.**  $13,700 is only $700 more than Bob's counteroffer and is within his budget.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation.** If Bob rejects this offer, Alice might not budge further, and Bob could end up paying more in the long run or even losing the deal to another buyer.
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  Bob can still buy from John if the negotiation with Alice fails, but that would cost more.

This decision balances the desire for a better price with the risk of delaying the purchase and possibly paying more in the end."
