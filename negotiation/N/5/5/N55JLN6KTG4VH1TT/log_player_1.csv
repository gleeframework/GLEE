Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a price closer to $800,000, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $850,000?  I believe this price still reflects the value of the product to you, and it gives us a good starting point for a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is my maximum budget for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. I've already reached my goal of earning at least $800,000, so there's no point in risking a further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price."
