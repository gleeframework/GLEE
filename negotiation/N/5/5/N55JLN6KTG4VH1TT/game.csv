"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $850,000?  I believe this price still reflects the value of the product to you, and it gives us a good starting point for a final agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is my maximum budget for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
