**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementing his offers in smaller amounts, signaling he might not reach a price that's significantly closer to your $1,200,000 valuation.  At this point, continuing the negotiation carries a higher risk of losing John's offer without a guarantee of getting a significantly better deal from Bob. It's more strategic to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
