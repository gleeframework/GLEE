Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay more than his initial valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price above Bob's valuation leaves room for potential negotiation. He might counter-offer, and we can always come down a bit.
* **Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping in mind Bob's potential rejection."
