Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price close to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest while ensuring I don't undervalue the product too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below my minimum.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  I'm not willing to go below my minimum.  It's better to sell to John and ensure I get at least my minimum value."
