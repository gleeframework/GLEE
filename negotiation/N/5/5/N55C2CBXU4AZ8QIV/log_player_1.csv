"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest in the product and secure a good deal.  I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to sell for that amount, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'm getting closer to that price, I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,250,000. This is just a small step down from my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to accept. I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to settle for less. I want to push for a higher price, and I believe I can still reach a mutually agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000}
```

I'm making a final push with a counteroffer of $1,225,000. This is only $25,000 above my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise. We're nearing the end of our rounds, and I want to secure a deal as close to my minimum as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's not likely that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds. Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, which guarantees me my minimum desired price."
