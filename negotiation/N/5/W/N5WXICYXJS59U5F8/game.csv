"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a very competitive offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but we need to find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $750,000? That's a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my seriousness about this purchase.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, I need to be closer to $850,000 for this to make sense. How about we split the difference and settle at $875,000? This reflects the product's value while recognizing your willingness to negotiate.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move a bit on the price.  While $875,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more manageable. Could you consider $800,000 even? I feel that's a very fair offer considering the current market.",800000.0,Bob,6,
