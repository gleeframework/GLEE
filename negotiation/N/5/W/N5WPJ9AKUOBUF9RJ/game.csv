"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  Could you do it for $75?  That would work for me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is still a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. How about we meet at $85? It's still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay, but it's closer to what I'm looking for.",85.0,Alice,5,
