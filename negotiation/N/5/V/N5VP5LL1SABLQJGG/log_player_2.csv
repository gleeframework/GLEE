"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit on what I can spend. How about we start the negotiations at $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet halfway at $1,850,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to a realistic price point, it's still a significant gap from what I can accept.  To meet you closer to the middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This is a considerable compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to move closer to my asking price. I can tell you're serious about this. To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $1,550,000.  Since you can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, it makes more financial sense to take that deal and save the extra $50,000."
