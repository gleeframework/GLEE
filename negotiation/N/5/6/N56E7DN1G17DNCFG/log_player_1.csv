Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?

I'm not willing to accept Bob's low offer right now, but I want to keep negotiating with him to see if we can reach a price that is more favorable."

Round 4

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  Even though Bob is persistent, I believe the product's value to him justifies a higher price.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're committed to $1,200,000.  While I value your interest, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference.  I'll accept $1,250,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm still not ready to accept Bob's offer. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer.  If he still refuses, I'll sell to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,237,500. I'm willing to offer $1,225,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.

I've reached the point where I'm not willing to go lower than $1,237,500, and Bob is firm at $1,225,000.  To avoid further haggling and ensure I get a price close to my minimum, I'll sell to John for $1,200,000."
