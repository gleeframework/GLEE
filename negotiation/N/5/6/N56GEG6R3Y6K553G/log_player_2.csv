"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it would be very valuable to you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is within your budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of $120.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $140 is a bit steep for me.  How about $130?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
