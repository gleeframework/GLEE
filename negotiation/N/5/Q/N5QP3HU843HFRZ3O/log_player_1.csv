Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting at $10,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm friendly and positive, emphasizing the product's value to Bob.  This helps to build a positive rapport and encourages him to consider the offer.

**Why this approach?**

* **Maximize Profit:**  A $10,000 sale is better than my minimum value of $12,000, and it leaves room for me to potentially negotiate higher if Bob is willing.
* **Avoid John's Offer:** By starting at a reasonable price, I'm hoping to get a deal with Bob before needing to go to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price. 
* **Potential for Counter-Offer:**  This approach allows for a negotiation process, which could lead to a better price for me.  

I'm confident that this offer will be attractive to Bob and allow for a successful negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is far below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. Accepting it would mean taking a significant loss.  While it's tempting to quickly secure a sale,  it's better to try and get a more fair price.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price closer to my desired value, but I'll also consider Bob's willingness to negotiate. This strategy allows me to try and find a price that is mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** $8,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my desired value and closer to his perceived value.
* **Message:** I am staying positive and friendly, acknowledging Bob's interest and emphasizing the value for both of us.  This helps build rapport and encourages him to consider the offer.
* **Reasoning:**  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value. It also provides a clear path forward for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Why this approach?**

* **Potential for Agreement:**  $8,000 is a reasonable middle ground, increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation.
* **Avoid John's Offer:**  I'm aiming to finalize a deal with Bob before resorting to John's offer. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  This counteroffer allows me to further explore Bob's willingness to pay and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value."
