"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, I was hoping to stay within a budget of $100 for this purchase. Would it be possible for us to negotiate towards that price?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $115? This would still be a good deal for you, considering you value it at $150.",115.0,Alice,3,
