"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. We've had a lot of interest in this product, and I think it's worth exploring a deal with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your desired price range.  While it's tempting to accept, it's worth exploring if you can get a lower price. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, and rejecting this offer gives you more leverage to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that it's still a great value for the product considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my desired price point.  However, it's a good sign she's willing to negotiate.  It's worth trying to push for a lower price and seeing if she's willing to budge further.  There's still plenty of room to negotiate, and rejecting this offer keeps my leverage in the negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit outside of what I can comfortably afford.  I'm going to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests, and I'm confident that it's a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000. This is a final compromise, and I'm confident that it's still a great value for the product considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is within my acceptable price range (under $1,500,000) and is closer to my desired price than John's offer.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's becoming increasingly likely that Alice will walk away or stick to her price.  With 5 rounds remaining, it's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price."
