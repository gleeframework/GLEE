"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still above what I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $13,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000, Bob. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,5,
