"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, Bob. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $15,000.
* Even though you could get it from John for $15,000, Alice's offer saves you $3,000."
