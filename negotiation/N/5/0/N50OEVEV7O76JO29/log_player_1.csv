This offer is a good starting point. It's below my minimum desired price of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and provides a starting point for Bob to respond. I'm confident this will kickstart a negotiation that will potentially benefit us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe I can still get a better price than $8,500. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $8,750. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to my desired price than $8,500, it's still significantly below my minimum of $10,000. I'm confident I can do better. I will make a counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $8,750 is still too low for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at $9,000, I'd be happy to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's final offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $10,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I don't want to risk losing out on the guaranteed $10,000 from John.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John."
