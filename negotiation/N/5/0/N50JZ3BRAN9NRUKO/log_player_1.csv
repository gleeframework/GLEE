Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  This gives Bob a reason to counter-offer, opening up a dialogue and allowing for potential negotiation. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me a solid fallback position if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's counteroffer is lower than I'd like, it's still closer to my target.  There's room to negotiate, and I'm willing to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's Offer is a Strong Backstop:** I'm confident that I can either get a better price from Bob or fall back on John's offer, which guarantees me my minimum goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $900,000?  That's a fair price considering the unique value of this product.  Let's try to work something out that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Value:**  $900,000 is still higher than Bob's initial offer but lower than my starting point, showing I'm willing to meet halfway.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message emphasizes collaboration and a mutually beneficial outcome, creating a more positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** While Bob's offer of $875,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  
* **Risk of Going Lower:**  Further negotiation could potentially result in a lower price, putting me in a position where I might have to accept a price that doesn't meet my minimum requirements.
* **Guarantee with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $1,000,000, eliminating the risk and uncertainty of further negotiations. 

**Conclusion:**  Given the potential risk of further negotiation with Bob, selling to John is the most secure and profitable option at this point."
