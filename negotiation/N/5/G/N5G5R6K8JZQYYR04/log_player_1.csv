Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $145. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for a potential profit beyond your minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $145 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), but it's close enough to your minimum that you're still comfortable with the potential loss if he rejects the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested, giving you a chance to potentially earn even more."
