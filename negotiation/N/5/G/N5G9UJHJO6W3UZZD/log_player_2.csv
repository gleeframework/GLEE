There's still a chance to get a better deal than $1,000,000.  It's important to remember that Bob has a ""walk away"" option with John, so there's no pressure to settle for a price that isn't satisfactory."

{""product_price"": 950000}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only one round left, it's highly unlikely Alice will come down to Bob's desired price. Alice has shown a pattern of increasing her price, making it probable she'll do so again in the final round.  Bob is close to his maximum price and wants to avoid any further risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer in the last round and forcing him to pay even more.  Buying from John, while not ideal, ensures Bob gets the product without the risk of a higher price in the final round of negotiation."
