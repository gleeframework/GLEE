I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a significant profit for me, but still potentially attractive to Bob since he values the product at $1,200,000. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to close the deal quickly, I'm willing to keep negotiating to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's initial offer.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in my product and accept this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This is my final offer. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'll sell to John."
