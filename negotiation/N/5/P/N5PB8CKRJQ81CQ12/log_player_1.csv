{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is close to my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. It also highlights the product's value to Bob, making him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $70 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $85. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $78. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $78 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value and I've already made a concession. To avoid further negotiation, I'll take John's offer for $80, ensuring I at least reach my minimum goal."
