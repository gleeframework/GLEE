"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $100, but $95 is still a bit too expensive.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer.
* **John is a backup option.**  Knowing you can buy from John for $100 gives you leverage in the negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer.** $85 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice. 
* **Leave room for negotiation.**  There's still potential for Alice to counter, but it's a good starting point to show you're serious about getting a better deal.
* **Remember John.** You can always go to John for $100, so you don't need to accept anything that's too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your ideal price range.
* **There's still potential for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer.
* **John is a backup option.** You have the option of buying from John for $100, so you're not under pressure to accept any offer that's too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Alice's value.**  $87 is closer to Alice's $80 value, showing you're willing to compromise.
* **Small increment.** This small increase from your previous offer of $85 shows you're serious about negotiating but are still trying to get a good deal.
* **Maintaining leverage.** You can still choose to buy from John for $100, so you don't need to accept anything unreasonable."
