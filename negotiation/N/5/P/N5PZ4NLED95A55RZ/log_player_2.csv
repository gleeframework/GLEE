"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is very close to your maximum budget, and there's a good chance you could get a slightly better deal by rejecting and counteroffering. However, there's also a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer or keep lowering the price until it's too close to your budget for comfort. 

Since the risk of losing the deal entirely is higher than the potential savings, accepting the offer is the most logical choice."
