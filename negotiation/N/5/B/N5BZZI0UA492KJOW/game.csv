"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
