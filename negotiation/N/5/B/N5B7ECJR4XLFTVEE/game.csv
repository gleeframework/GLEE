"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Let's split the difference and go with $110.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I can confidently move forward with the purchase.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get at least $130 for this product. It's a final offer.",130.0,Alice,5,
