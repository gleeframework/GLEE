Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we start at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at that price?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $12,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I could be flexible, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13,500?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. This product is truly top-of-the-line, and $13,500 is a very low price for the value you're getting.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll meet you at $14,000. That's the highest I can go.

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I could potentially squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's not worth the risk of him walking away. John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price."
