"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to you.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $115? That's a fair compromise, I think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $122. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to you.",122.0,Alice,5,
