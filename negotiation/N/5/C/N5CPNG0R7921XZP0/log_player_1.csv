Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, making it a reasonable starting point.  It also leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer in John, giving me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more money. Would you be willing to consider $10,800 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it makes more sense to try to get closer to my goal by sending a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,800 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,150? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider $10,900 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $12,000.  While we've gone through a few rounds of negotiation, it seems unlikely that he'll come up to my price. It's time to move on and take the guaranteed deal with John."
