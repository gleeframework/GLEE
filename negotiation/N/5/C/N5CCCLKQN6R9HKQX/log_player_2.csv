"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $9,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This still represents a significant value for you, and it gives us both a fair deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,250 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob still has room to negotiate and potentially save even more.  He can try to push for a lower price by counteroffering.  Additionally, Bob is aware that John is selling the same product for $12,000, which serves as a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,875?  That would give us both a good deal and move us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still open to working with you, but $9,875 is still a bit too low.  Let's compromise at $10,000. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:** $10,000 is a good price for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $12,000. He's saving $2,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has shown willingness to negotiate and has come down from her initial offer of $11,000. 
* **Risk of Rejection:**  There's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers, potentially leading to a deal with John at a higher price. 
* **Time Factor:** This is Round 5, and with limited rounds remaining, accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product without risking a drawn-out negotiation. 

Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for a reasonable price."
