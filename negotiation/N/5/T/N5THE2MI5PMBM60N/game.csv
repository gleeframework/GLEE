"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but this product is worth significantly more to you than that.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $850,000? This price is still very fair, and it allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $775,000?  It's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,
