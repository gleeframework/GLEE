**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000, it's still above Bob's personal value of $12,000.  Since Bob has a fallback option with John, rejecting Alice's offer leaves room for potential negotiation or finding a different seller who might match his desired price."
