Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the product's value. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and has shown a willingness to negotiate.  
* **Potential for better price:** I believe I can still secure a higher price by continuing to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to meet somewhere between his offer and my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This would allow me to make a fair deal, and I believe it's still a great price for you given the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to meet Bob halfway, showing good faith in the negotiation.
* **Justified price:**  $13,500 is still significantly above my minimum, but it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's offer.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer, or move on to John."
