Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This will leave room for negotiation and ensure I get as much as possible.  I'm also framing it as a great deal for him, which might encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value but still below what I'm aiming for. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to show flexibility and willingness to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to try and convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a good value for me. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, and Bob's offers consistently below my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John.  It's a sure thing, and I'm not willing to risk losing more time trying to squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob."
