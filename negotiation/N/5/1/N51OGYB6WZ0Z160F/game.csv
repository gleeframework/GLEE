"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment for you, given its value to your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This price reflects the potential it holds for you while still leaving room for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good profit for you.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still allows for a healthy profit margin for you and a fair return on the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,
