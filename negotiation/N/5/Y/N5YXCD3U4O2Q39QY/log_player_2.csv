Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. How about we meet in the middle again at $107.50?

Alice is very unlikely to go below $100. It's better to secure the product at $100 from John than to risk a higher counteroffer from Alice."
