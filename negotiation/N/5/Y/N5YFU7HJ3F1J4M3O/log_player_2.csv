"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's worth to her ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's actual value.  I'm willing to offer you $10,000 for it. This price is still above what the product is worth to you, and it allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to me is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's well below his maximum price of $15,000 and provides a decent profit margin for Alice.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking further negotiation or having to pay the higher price from John."
