"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your desire for savings.  While I value your offer, the $850,000 price doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential of this product.

"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $920,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher number to reflect the product's true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $935,000?  This would represent a fair deal for both of us.",935000.0,Alice,5,
