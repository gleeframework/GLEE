Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** This price is comfortably above your $80 minimum, ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly.

By starting with a strong but not unreasonable offer, you increase the likelihood of a sale to Bob at a price that benefits you the most."
