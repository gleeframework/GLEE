{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a good starting point for me to gauge Bob's interest and how willing he is to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the deal,  I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $13,000? That's still a good price for you, and it would be a great deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $13,000 is still quite a bit below my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a great deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
