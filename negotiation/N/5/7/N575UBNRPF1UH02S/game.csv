"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the deal,  I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $13,000? That's still a good price for you, and it would be a great deal for me.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $13,000 is still quite a bit below my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a great deal. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,
