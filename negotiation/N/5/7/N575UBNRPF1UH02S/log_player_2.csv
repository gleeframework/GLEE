"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  There's room for both parties to find a price that works better for them."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the deal,  I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $13,000? That's still a good price for you, and it would be a great deal for me."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $13,000 is still quite a bit below my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a great deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is a better price than her initial offer and closer to Bob's counteroffer.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might not be willing to go lower or could even withdraw her offer altogether. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer while still allowing Alice to make a profit."
