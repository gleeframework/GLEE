"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of this product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. This seems like a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to close a deal, I won't compromise my bottom line too early. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is far below the value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price reflects the significant value this product offers, while still giving you a fair deal. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. While $1,250,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you consider $1,100,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but $1,100,000 is still below my bottom line. I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $1,150,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, this product will be a benefit to my business, and I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? That feels like a fair compromise to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is within my minimum acceptable price range. I'm happy to close the deal at this price, as it's a fair compromise and secures the sale without risking losing the deal entirely."
