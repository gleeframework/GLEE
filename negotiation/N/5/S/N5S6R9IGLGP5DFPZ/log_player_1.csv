Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
