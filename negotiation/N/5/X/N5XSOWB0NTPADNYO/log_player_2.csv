"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $13,500 isn't a terrible price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is starting higher than her own valuation, meaning she's open to making a deal. By rejecting the initial offer, you might incentivize Alice to propose a lower price, bringing you closer to your $15,000 limit and saving you money."
