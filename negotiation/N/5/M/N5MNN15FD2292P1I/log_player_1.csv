"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Bob's initial assessment of $10,000, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000.  I have 10 rounds, and John is a guaranteed sale at my desired price.  There's no need to rush into a deal that doesn't meet my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This gives you a fair price and me a good return. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $14,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,000.  John is a guaranteed sale at $15,000, which is my absolute minimum.  With only 6 rounds remaining, there's no guarantee that Bob will come up to my price, and I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal.  Selling to John ensures I meet my financial goals."
