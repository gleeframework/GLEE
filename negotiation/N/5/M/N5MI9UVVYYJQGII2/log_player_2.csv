"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to test Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $100 is a considerable drop from her initial offer, but it's still within my budget. If she's not willing to come down that much, I'll have to consider my options further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get her to come down to $110. If she doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John at $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a compromise price of $110. This is a small jump from my last offer, showing Alice I'm serious about making a deal but also willing to meet her halfway.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get her to accept. If not, I'll be getting closer to John's price and might have to consider my options."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get the product for $110, Alice is only $2 away from that price. I've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and at this point, the risk of going lower and losing the deal with Alice is higher than the potential savings of $2.  It's a good price within my budget, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
