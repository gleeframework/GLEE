"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,400,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe it will be highly profitable for you.  Consider this: you value the product at $1,500,000, and this offer allows you to acquire it for a considerable discount.  If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,000,000, so the decision is entirely yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
