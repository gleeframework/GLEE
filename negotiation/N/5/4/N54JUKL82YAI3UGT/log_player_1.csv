Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value this product could bring, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,075,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,000,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Matching John's Offer:** Bob's offer now matches what John is willing to pay. There's no guaranteed financial benefit to continuing negotiations with Bob.
* **Time Value:**  Every round we spend negotiating is a risk. Bob could walk away, or the deal could sour. Accepting now secures the $1,000,000.
* **Relationship:** Accepting shows Bob I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually beneficial deal. This can be valuable for future interactions."
