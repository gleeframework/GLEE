"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique value of the product, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $9500, which is a significant offer considering the value I place on this product.  Let's find a way to make this work.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9500 is a significant offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10800. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it brings.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your flexibility. $10800 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10200, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10200. I'll meet you halfway between $10800 and $10200. I'll sell the product to you for $10500. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it brings.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, and I'm sure we're both close to a deal. However, $10500 is still a bit beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10100, which I believe is a very fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finally find a way to close this deal.",10100.0,Bob,8,
