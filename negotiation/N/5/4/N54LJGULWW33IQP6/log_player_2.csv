"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $125. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $150 to her, so I'm sure she's trying to make a profit. I'd rather wait and buy it from John for $100.
