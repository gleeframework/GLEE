Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $100?  I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though $100 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a little more for the product.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's a fair price for both of us, I believe.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $112.50.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $112.50 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's better to secure a sale now than to risk getting nothing."
