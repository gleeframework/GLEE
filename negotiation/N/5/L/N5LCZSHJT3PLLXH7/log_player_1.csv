"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $2000000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can't go higher than $1000000. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for my product.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,000,000 is too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1750000, but I'm still limited to $1250000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a significant step towards a deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  I'm not ready to settle for that yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to compromise further, but $1,250,000 is still too low. Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1500000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1350000. This is a fair price considering our previous offers, and it's the best I can do at the moment. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  We've been going back and forth for several rounds, and while I'm open to negotiation, I don't think we're likely to come to an agreement that meets my needs.  I'm choosing to sell to John at $1,500,000 to ensure I get a fair price for my product."
