Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $700000, but I have to consider the value I've assigned to the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering you the product for $775000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm offering you the product for $760000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $760,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a significant concession by dropping her price to $760,000. While you'd still prefer to pay $750,000,  further negotiation might risk Alice walking away or you having to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer gives you a good deal while minimizing the chance of losing the opportunity altogether."
