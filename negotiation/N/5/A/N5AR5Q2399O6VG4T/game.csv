"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price you've proposed. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but that price point wouldn't be feasible for me.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,700,000? I think this represents a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your effort in trying to find a middle ground. Given my financial situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,550,000. This is still below my ideal price, but I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
