"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation from a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,700,000. This is still a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it's a more realistic number considering Bob's initial low offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired outcome. I'll reject it and continue negotiating with Bob.  There's still room for a better price, and I want to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,600,000. This is a smaller step down from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize this and reciprocate by offering a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'm going to reject his offer and try to see if we can squeeze a bit more out of the deal in the next round. There's a chance Bob might increase his offer slightly, or I might be able to negotiate a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm offering $1,450,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. It also signals that I'm seriously considering Bob's offer, but I still believe there's some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm running out of time.  I've already rejected a few offers that were very close to my minimum, and I'm not sure if Bob will be willing to meet my price. To be safe and ensure I get at least my minimum, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
