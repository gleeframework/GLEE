Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $14,250? This is my last offer, and I'm not going to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**  

While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to move much below $14,250. You have a guaranteed option with John for $10,000. At this point, the potential savings with John outweigh the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially getting a price closer to $14,000."
