Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $700,000 is far too low, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'm still willing to negotiate but won't settle for such a significant loss."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product.

What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value I'll get from it, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a deal I'm comfortable with. I'm going to hold out for a better offer.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value I'll get from it, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$775,000 is still too low. We're getting close, but I'm not going to accept anything less than $800,000 at this point. I think I can still get a better deal from Bob, and if not, I'll go with John."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. We've reached a point where Bob and I are very close in price, but the negotiation is taking too long. I'm not confident that Bob will come up to my asking price, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John for a much higher amount."
