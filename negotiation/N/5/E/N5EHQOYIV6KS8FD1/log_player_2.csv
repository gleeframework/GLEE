Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is still not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal and move on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000.
