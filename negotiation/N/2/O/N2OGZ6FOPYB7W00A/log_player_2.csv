"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best way to start the negotiation process.  I'll aim for a price closer to my $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it,  which is still a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a reasonable range. It shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also trying to reach a fair price.  We're still early in the negotiation, so a more aggressive counteroffer makes sense."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $10,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a compromise, it's still too high for my budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a lower price.  Rejecting her offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still out of my price range. I'm ready to make a final offer of $12,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a good profit for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is closer to my $8,000 limit but still leaves some room for Alice to make a counteroffer if she wants.  I've framed it as a ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and pressure for Alice to accept.  Since we're in round 4, we're getting closer to the midpoint of the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $12,000 is still not meeting my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $18,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  We're in round 5, and while there's still potential for negotiation, the likelihood of Alice dropping down to a price I'm comfortable with is decreasing.  Buying the product from John for $8,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget and avoids further potential negotiation headaches."
