"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum, I leave room for negotiation and create an impression of the product's high value.
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, I provide a brief justification by mentioning ""unique features"" and ""potential"" to plant the seed of value in Bob's mind. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My language (""starting point for our discussion"") clearly signals that I am open to negotiation and expect Bob to come back with a counter-offer.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response will reveal how interested he is in the product. 
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While the initial price is ambitious, if Bob accepts, I get the best possible outcome.
3. **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Even if he rejects the offer, it sets the stage for a negotiation process where I can strategically move towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Would you consider selling the product for $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above his own valuation of $1,200,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I know I have another buyer (John) willing to pay the full amount. 

Therefore, it makes strategic sense to reject Bob's offer and:

1. **Maintain a Strong Position:** Rejecting this offer signals that I am serious about the product's value and not desperate to sell below my limit. 
2. **Explore Further Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate with Bob before resorting to John's offer. I'll aim for a counter-offer closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. However, the offer of $1,400,000 falls short of what I believe is fair compensation. To move things forward, I'd be willing to accept $1,800,000.  This feels like a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've come down from my initial offer ($2,000,000) to $1,800,000, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Above Minimum, But Room to Negotiate:** This price is still comfortably above my minimum ($1,500,000) and John's offer, leaving some space for further negotiation if needed.
* **Justify the Price:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point and position it as a ""reasonable compromise."" 
* **Encourage a Response:** The tone remains positive and encouraging, urging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I still believe we can come to an agreement closer to my initial proposal. Could you consider $1,600,000 as a fair price for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and a significant profit margin. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. 

Here's why accepting makes sense:

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,600,000 is a substantial amount and ensures a good profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for more money risks losing Bob as a buyer altogether. He might counteroffer lower or decide not to continue negotiations. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means I receive the money sooner, which has its own value.

Overall, accepting Bob's offer at this point represents a favorable balance of risk and potential reward."
