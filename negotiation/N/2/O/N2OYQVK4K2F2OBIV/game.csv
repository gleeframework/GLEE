"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $2,000,000 to start the conversation. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $2,000,000 is significantly more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,700,000 is still outside my budget. I understand you value this product highly, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and is a fair compromise for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the price gap remains significant. I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $1,450,000. This is my best and final offer. I believe it represents a fair price considering the unique value this product offers.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
