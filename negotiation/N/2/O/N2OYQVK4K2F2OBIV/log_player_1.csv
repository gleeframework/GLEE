Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $2,000,000 is significantly more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
