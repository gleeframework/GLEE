"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  You can then counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, given its value to me and your desired profit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value to you justifies a higher price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit from her initial offer, $1,300,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I need to try to negotiate further to get a price that works for me."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This gives you a good profit and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I still think the product's value justifies a premium price. I'll consider $1,250,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above my maximum budget.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that the price won't go down enough for me.  Given that John is willing to sell me the product for $1,500,000, it's more financially responsible to purchase from him and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
