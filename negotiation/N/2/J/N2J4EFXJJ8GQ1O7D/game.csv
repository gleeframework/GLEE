"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for negotiation.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
