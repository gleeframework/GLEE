"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $14,500. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is a good compromise.  It's still lower than John's price, and Bob gets a better deal than Alice's initial offer. Accepting ensures Bob gets the product without risking a further negotiation that might push the price back up."
