,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  Let's try to find a number that works for both of us.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $132.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's see if we can close the deal at that price.",130.0,Bob,4,
