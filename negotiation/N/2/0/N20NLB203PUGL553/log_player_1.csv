"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed $800,000 from John, so I have some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a good price, I think I can do better. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price, especially since I have John as a backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a decent amount closer to my desired price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair deal and accept."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm starting to get a little nervous as rounds go by, $925,000 is still significantly less than my desired price, and it's also only slightly higher than John's guaranteed offer. I believe I can still get a better deal from Bob, especially if I hold firm."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision.  Bob's final offer is still significantly lower than what I would like, but I'm running out of time.  I'm going to go with the guaranteed $800,000 from John. It's not ideal, but it's better than risking getting nothing."
