Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its value and presents a win-win scenario for both of us. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $925,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still keeping you comfortably above your fallback offer from John.
* **Confident and Positive Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as mutually beneficial, increasing the likelihood of Bob's acceptance."
