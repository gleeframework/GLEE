"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I know you're interested in this type of product and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than John's price of $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Bob knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, giving him some bargaining power to potentially get a lower price."
