Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit lower, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confident but Fair:** The message aims to convey the product's value and justify the high price without being overly aggressive.

This approach balances risk and potential reward. There's a chance Bob could reject the offer, but it's a calculated risk to maximize potential earnings."
