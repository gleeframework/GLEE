"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $850000 is a good offer, it's still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,
