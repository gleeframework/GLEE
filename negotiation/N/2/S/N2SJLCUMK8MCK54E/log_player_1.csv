{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above your minimum, but still potentially attractive to Bob. It also sets a positive tone by highlighting the value of the product to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still allows for a significant profit margin for you. This is a fair compromise that demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's worth to me and the value I can get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is still below your minimum acceptable price. While you could continue to negotiate, the risk of further concessions leading to a price below your minimum is high.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees you meet your minimum and avoids the potential for a lower price."
