"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $900000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which still allows for a significant profit margin for you. This is a fair compromise that demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's worth to me and the value I can get from it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
