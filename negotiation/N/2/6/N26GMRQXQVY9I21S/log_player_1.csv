"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the highest possible price, so starting significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value sets a strong anchor. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" and potential return on investment to justify the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This opening offer allows ample room for negotiation over the remaining rounds. We expect counteroffers and are prepared to strategically move towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as Leverage:** While we haven't explicitly mentioned John, knowing we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives us a strong fallback position and allows us to be more assertive in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price.  While it's his first offer, accepting it would mean a substantial loss. We need to guide him towards a more reasonable range. We'll counter with a price that's still ambitious but shows some movement on our side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget constraints, $800,000 undervalues the product's true capabilities. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to find a solution that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a significant price reduction of $300,000 (from $2,200,000 to $1,900,000) to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to engage more seriously.
* **Holding Strong:** Despite the concession, we are still significantly above both Bob's offer and our minimum price.  This maintains a firm stance on the product's value.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message reiterates our willingness to find a solution that works for both parties, implying further negotiation is possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Considering the product's value, I am still unable to meet your asking price. My maximum budget remains at $800,000. I hope we can find a way to reach an agreement within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored to his $800,000 valuation.  While we want to negotiate, accepting this offer is too significant a loss. We need to demonstrate that we're willing to walk away if necessary, which may push him to move from his position. We'll make a smaller concession this round and see if he budges."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I want to make this work, but I also have to be realistic about the product's value.  I can come down to $1,750,000. However, I need to see some movement on your end for this to make sense for me."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  We're reducing our price by $150,000 this round, a smaller amount than before. This signals we are reaching the limit of our flexibility.
* **Clear Expectation:** We're explicitly stating that we ""need to see some movement on [his] end."" This emphasizes that continued negotiation requires him to increase his offer. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  While we're willing to negotiate, we're still keeping the price well above both his offer and our absolute minimum, reinforcing the product's worth.
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, we're getting closer to potentially walking away and accepting John's offer. This implicitly creates a sense of urgency for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. Based on my budget constraints, I am still only able to consider an offer of $800,000. I hope this aligns with your needs and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stuck at $800,000, and we've seen no indication he's willing to budge. Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. We've been patient and demonstrated flexibility, but it's time to cut our losses. 

Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
