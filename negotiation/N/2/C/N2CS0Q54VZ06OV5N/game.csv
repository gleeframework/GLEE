,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. Considering the value I've attached to the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $16000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth and takes into account your budget constraints.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I would like to propose an offer of $14000 for the product. This amount reflects a compromise between the value I see in the product and my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. However, I still believe the product's value exceeds $14000. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. My counteroffer remains the same as in round 3: $16000 for the product. If you're still interested, I'm open to discussing further.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to make one final offer of $15000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $15000. As we've discussed, the product is worth at least $18000 to me, and I'm not willing to give it away at a price that's too low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15000 and $18000. My new counteroffer is $16500 for the product. I hope this is more in line with what you're willing to pay.",16500.0,Alice,7,

My new counteroffer is $17000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable item.",17000.0,Alice,9,
