"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm looking to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her perceived value of the product, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  While it's closer to his target, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try for a better price, potentially closer to his desired $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer $1,020,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,020,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation are small, and the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer is high. 

It's more efficient and less risky for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. This guarantees Bob gets the product at his desired price without risking further negotiation rounds."
