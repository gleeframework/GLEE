"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer $1,020,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,5,
