"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is less than the $15,000 from John, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $13,000 is a reasonable starting point, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further compromise. This counteroffer is also below Alice's desired price of $12,000, making it more likely she'll consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,800 is closer to Bob's limit than John's price, it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get closer to his target price, potentially by making a slightly higher counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility and a willingness to move closer to Alice's price.  $13,500 is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer, but it's a compromise that could potentially lead to a deal.  This counteroffer also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,200 is now higher than John's price of $15,000. There's no longer any incentive to continue negotiating with Alice. Bob can secure the product for a lower price by going with John."
