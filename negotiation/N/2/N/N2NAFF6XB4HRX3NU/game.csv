"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid I can't go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $110. Is that something you'd be interested in?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a little high for me. How about we settle on $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is a good price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $108, which is a bit higher than your last offer. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",108.0,Alice,5,
