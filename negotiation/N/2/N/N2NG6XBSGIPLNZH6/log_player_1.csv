Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a fair price.  If he rejects, we can then start to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

$8,000 is far too low for me. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm going to counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is my minimum price, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price considering the value of the product. If he still refuses, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with. I'm going to counteroffer Bob again, hoping to get closer to my desired price before I decide to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate, but that I'm also not willing to sell for a price that undervalues my product. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely have to sell to John."
