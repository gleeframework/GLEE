"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but the price you're suggesting doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges its value while still making it a worthwhile investment for you.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my financial constraints.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
