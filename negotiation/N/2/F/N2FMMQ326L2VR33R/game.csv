"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $9,500, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500? I believe this price is fair, considering your value and my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still gives you a great value, and it's a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,750?  That's a fair compromise that's closer to my budget and still gives you a good profit.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,875.  It's a fair compromise for both of us, and it keeps this deal moving forward.",8875.0,Alice,5,
