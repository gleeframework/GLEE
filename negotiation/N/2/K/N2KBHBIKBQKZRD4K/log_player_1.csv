"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a strong starting point, demonstrating my confidence in the product's worth.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to engage in a back-and-forth that ultimately leads to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a compromise, showing my willingness to negotiate, but still significantly above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price while also keeping the deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still not ready to settle.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,500,000, and there are still rounds remaining to negotiate. I believe I can squeeze a bit more out of the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,550,000. This is a significant drop from my last offer, showing my willingness to meet Bob halfway. It's also just above my minimum acceptable price, so there's little room for further concessions on my end. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiation has stalled. While I'm not completely out of rounds, Bob's offers are increasingly unattractive. It's clear he's unwilling to come close to my desired value. To avoid risking a worse deal, I'll take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
