The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $120. It's not a good deal, so you should reject the offer and try to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit on this sale.

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your $100 limit. You're better off continuing to negotiate."

Alice is firm on her price, and you've already gone back and forth. It's clear you won't be able to get it for less than $105. Since you're willing to pay $100 for the product, it makes more sense to buy it from John and avoid further negotiation."
