"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is quite high, there's room for negotiation. Let's see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, which might make her think twice. It also leaves us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our maximum budget and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still closer to her value than ours.  Let's counter again and see if we can get closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about $11,250?  I think that's a fair compromise."",

}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice we're willing to move, but we're sticking to a price closer to our target. It's a strong negotiating position without being overly aggressive."
