Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations slightly above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression you might be willing to compromise. 
* **Not Too High:** While aiming high, it's important to keep the offer within a reasonable range. A price too close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) might discourage him from negotiating.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price helps justify it and makes it seem less arbitrary. 

By starting at $14,000, I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still leaving room for a potential counter-offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and his own perceived value ($15,000).  Accepting this offer would mean losing out on a significant profit margin. While selling to John for $12,000 is an option, I believe there is still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (but firm):** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still remaining firm on a price above my minimum.
* **Middle Ground:**  Offering a price directly in the middle of our previous offers might seem like a fair compromise to Bob. 
* **Above Reserve:** Importantly, this price still ensures a profit above my reserve price of $12,000. 

By offering $12,500, I'm aiming for a win-win situation where I secure a decent profit and Bob gets the product at a price significantly lower than his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about $11,250?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,250 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away from the deal entirely. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
