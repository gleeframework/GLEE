Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to Alice's value of $1,200,000 as possible while still staying within his budget. Offering $1,250,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There's still room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1260000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increased his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  He's still below Alice's current offer, and hopefully, this will lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,270,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,270,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,270,000, which is within Bob's budget and much closer to his desired price.  While there might be some room for further negotiation, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a much higher price is increasing. Accepting the offer ensures a deal at a reasonable price."
