Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is higher than Bob's $80 valuation, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still above your minimum of $120, so you're not losing money immediately. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive and leaves room for counteroffers, which keeps the negotiation going.

This strategy allows you to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If he accepts, great! If not, you can see if he's willing to counteroffer.
* **Maximize your potential profit:** You're not settling for your minimum immediately, but leaving space for a better outcome.
* **Keep the door open to John:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, you still have John as a backup buyer."

# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $95? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That seems like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
