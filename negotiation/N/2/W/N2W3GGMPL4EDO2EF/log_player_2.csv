"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you.  I'm confident that this price represents a great value for both of us. Please consider this offer carefully. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $800,000.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is employing some negotiation tactics (mentioning another buyer and the product's supposed worth to you), her offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John."
