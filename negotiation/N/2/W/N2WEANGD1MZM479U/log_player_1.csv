Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum, but it's a chance for Bob to acquire the product at a potentially lower price than he might find elsewhere. If he declines, I'll still be able to sell it to John for $1,500,000, so there's no risk on my end."
