Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting with a significantly higher price than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation. Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, it sets a higher anchor point for further discussion.
* **Scarcity Tactic:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Notes:**

* This strategy assumes you have some leverage in the negotiation, and that Bob doesn't have other readily available options to acquire the product at his desired price.
*  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects the initial offer. You can gradually lower the price, but always stay above your minimum of $10,000. 
*  If negotiations stall and Bob seems unwilling to budge, accepting John's offer of $10,000 is your guaranteed fallback option."
