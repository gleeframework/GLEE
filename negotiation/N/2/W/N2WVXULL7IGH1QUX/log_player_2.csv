"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $120, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal compared to John's $150, there's still room for negotiation.  You're aiming to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and I understand you have a budget. However, $100 is a bit too low for me considering the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. What do you say?
