It's worth negotiating with Alice.  $120 is a good price, but you can try to get it lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob! I can see if I can do a bit better. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.

Alice's offer of $110 is a good compromise. It's still a bit above your initial counteroffer, but it's within your budget and a better deal than buying from John."
