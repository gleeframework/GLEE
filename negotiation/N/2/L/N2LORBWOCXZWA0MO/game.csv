"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? This would still be a great value for you, considering the product's worth.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 just isn't enough for me to part with the product.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so how about $11,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a great deal on a valuable product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but no higher. Can you meet me at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to make one final compromise, how about $11,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal on this valuable product. I'm confident you won't find a better offer like this anywhere else.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've already stretched my budget as far as I can. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but no higher. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10750.0,Bob,8,
