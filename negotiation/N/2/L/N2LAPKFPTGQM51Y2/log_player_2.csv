Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more,  how about $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement. What do you say?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $9,000.  At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John for $8,000 ensures I get the product at the best possible price for me."
