"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a bit less. How does $110 sound? This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a good profit as well. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $110 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and is already offering a significant discount from her perceived value."
