"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy the product for a price closer to its actual value. How about we meet in the middle?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to my desired range. By offering $650,000, I'm aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's opening while still leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  Phrasing like ""closer to its actual value"" and ""meet in the middle"" are tactics to make Alice reconsider her position without being confrontational. 
* **Strategic positioning:** This counteroffer establishes a strong starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I have to consider my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer, so I'm proposing a price of $875,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but her ""lowest"" price is still significantly higher than my target.  While $875,000 is closer to a fair compromise, I'm willing to push a bit further before accepting.  There's still room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to, but $875,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $750,000? That's a significant move on my part, showing how serious I am about buying this product."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility, but hold firm:**  Moving to $750,000 demonstrates willingness to compromise while still targeting a price well below Alice's ""lowest."" 
* **Emphasize seriousness:** Highlighting the significant jump from the previous counteroffer strengthens the message that I'm genuinely interested but need a fair deal. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Continuing to be appreciative and collaborative keeps the negotiation amicable, increasing the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're serious about buying the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $875,000, which is $812,500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close enough:** At $812,500, the price is now within a reasonable range of Alice's value and well below John's offer. 
* **Alice is firm:** She's consistently emphasized this is her lowest, suggesting further negotiation might be fruitless.
* **Avoid losing the deal:** Pushing too hard risks Alice walking away, leaving me to settle for John's much higher price. 

While I could try for a slightly lower price, the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether.  Accepting at $812,500 secures a good price and avoids a costly alternative."
