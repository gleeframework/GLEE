"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit high for me. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $75 is far too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $125. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit.  What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm willing to go up to $90. Would that work for you?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $90 is still too low for me.  Let's try $110.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $100? That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
