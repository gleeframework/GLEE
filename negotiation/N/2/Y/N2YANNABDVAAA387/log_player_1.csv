{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** A $100,000 buffer allows for potential counteroffers without forcing me to accept a price below my minimum.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage.

**Strategy:**

* **Observe Bob's Reaction:** If he rejects the offer, his counteroffer will reveal his negotiating strategy.
* **Counter Offer Strategically:** I'll adjust my counteroffers based on Bob's responses, keeping in mind my minimum price and John's offer as a safety net. 
* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:**  If negotiations stall or Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has shown interest, and I can likely get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'll make a counteroffer closer to my initial offer, perhaps around $1,300,000. 
* **Be Firm:** I'll be firm in my counteroffer but willing to negotiate further if necessary. 
* **Keep John in Mind:** If Bob becomes unreasonable, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This still gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise without completely conceding.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing that this price still gives Bob a good deal, encouraging him to consider it seriously.
* **Maintain Openness:** The message is still friendly and suggests a willingness to negotiate further.

**Strategy:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to consider my options more carefully. 
* **Prepare for More Negotiation:** I'm ready to adjust my counteroffers further if needed, but I'll be mindful of my minimum acceptable price.
* **Don't Forget John:** The option of selling to John for $1,500,000 remains a safety net if negotiations become too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position. I would like to counteroffer at $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'd prefer a higher price, it's likely that any further negotiation will be time-consuming and may not result in a significantly better offer.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Rejecting Bob's offer could lead to further negotiations that may not yield a better outcome. There's also a chance Bob could walk away entirely.

**Strategy:**

* **Accept to Secure the Deal:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that's acceptable to me.
* **Future Considerations:**  This experience will inform my future negotiation strategies, especially when dealing with buyers who have a defined price range. 
* **John's Offer as a Backup:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind for future deals, as it provides a solid fallback option."
