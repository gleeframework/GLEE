"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in your product, $2000000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm happy to consider your product at a price of $1000000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000, which is a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not able to go that low.  $1500000 is the absolute minimum I can accept for this product. It's a significant investment for me, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  If you're serious about working together, let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1500000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1300000. This is a significant offer, and I'm confident it's fair considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
