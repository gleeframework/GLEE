Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

Since you have a safety net with John, you can aim high with Bob.  The key is to find a price that's appealing to him while maximizing your profit. 

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects its potential. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,400,000 is a significant profit for you while still leaving Bob with a $100,000 gain compared to his perceived value.
* **Time Pressure:** The ""limited-time offer"" creates urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Confidence:**  Phrases like ""fair"" and ""unique value proposition"" reinforce the product's worth.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have room to go down slightly, but don't go below $1,200,000.
* **Relationship:** Consider if a long-term relationship with Bob is more valuable than squeezing every dollar in this deal. This might influence your starting price."
