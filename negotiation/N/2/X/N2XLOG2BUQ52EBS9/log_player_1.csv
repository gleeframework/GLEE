I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This price is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
