Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation. It's also below Bob's perceived value of $12,000, giving him an incentive to accept.  We'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is a bit low, but it's still above my minimum price of $10,000. I think I can do better.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe this product is worth $11,000.  This is a fair compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Okay, I've gone back and forth with Bob a couple of times.  While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob seems unwilling to budge much further. Accepting his offer of $10,750 is still a good deal for me, especially since John is only offering $10,000.  Let's close this deal."
