"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a significant amount to you.  I'm confident this is a fair price, but I'm open to discussion. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'm looking to get from the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to compromise.  However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can reasonably accept. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. Would you be willing to consider $1,500,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
