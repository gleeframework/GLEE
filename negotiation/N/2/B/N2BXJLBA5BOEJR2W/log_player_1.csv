Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer will help gauge Bob's interest level and give you an idea of his negotiating style.  
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 provides a safety net. You can afford to be more firm in your negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's closer to his perceived value of $10,000, you have room to negotiate further. You know John will buy it for $15,000, so there's no need to settle for less at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you consider a price closer to $18,000?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop but Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer shows flexibility but still keeps the price well above your $15,000 safety net.
* **Encourages a Counter:** By coming down a significant amount, you're encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer closer to your desired range. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help you understand how much Bob is actually willing to pay. If he rejects this offer, you can consider moving closer to your minimum or taking John's deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 now matches your minimum acceptable price and what John is willing to pay.  There's no strategic advantage to continuing the negotiation at this point. Accepting the offer secures the best possible outcome for you in this scenario."
