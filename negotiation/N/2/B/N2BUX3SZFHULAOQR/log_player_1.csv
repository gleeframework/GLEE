Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I believe you'll find great value in it."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation of $150 without risking a rejection. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $140 is our ideal price, starting a bit lower might open the door for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to $150.
* **Considering the Alternative:** Even if Bob rejects our offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John for $120."
