"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a truly unique product. I believe its value is significant, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset for you.  My initial offer is $1500000.  Let's discuss this further.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget allows.  To make this work, I would need to offer a lower price.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its potential value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me. It's important to acknowledge the true value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a counterproposal of $1200000.  This reflects a compromise and provides you with significant value.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1200000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to offer $950000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
