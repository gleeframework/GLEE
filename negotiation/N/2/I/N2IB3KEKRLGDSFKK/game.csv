"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet closer to the middle at $14,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
