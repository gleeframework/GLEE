"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I've done some research and I believe it's a bit pricey. I'd like to discuss further and see if we can meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies the original price. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1750000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true worth, but I'm willing to make a concession to keep the deal moving forward. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better than $1750000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Can we discuss further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price?",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $1700000. I think that's the lowest price I can accept and still make a reasonable profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within that range. How about we meet at $1650000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair one.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
