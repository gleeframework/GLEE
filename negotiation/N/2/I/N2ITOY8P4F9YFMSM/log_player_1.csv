"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:**  The price leaves room for a counteroffer from Bob, allowing for a back-and-forth.
* **Avoiding John Immediately:**  I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob before resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product and would like to make a counteroffer of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's counteroffer of $90 is still lower than my minimum price of $120. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price. 
* **Not Ready for John Yet:** While John's offer is tempting, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, I'm hoping for a bit more to make this deal work.  How about $95? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm counter-offering with $95, which is halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable price.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a good deal for both of us, emphasizing fairness and potential for a win-win outcome.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum of $120, but it gives Bob some wiggle room to potentially counteroffer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I would like to counter with an offer of $92 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $92 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Progress is Slow:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, the negotiation is moving slowly, and I'm not sure if he'll be willing to go higher.
* **John is an Option:**  Selling to John for $120 is becoming increasingly appealing, but I'm not giving up on Bob just yet. I'll see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $92 is still a bit lower than what I need.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering the product for $94.  This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Stance:**  I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer to put some pressure on Bob.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering $94, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, shows I'm willing to compromise while still standing my ground.
* **Threat of Other Options:** Mentioning ""other options"" subtly hints at John's offer and motivates Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I would like to counter with an offer of $93 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $93 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still lower than $120.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only four rounds left, the time to negotiate is dwindling.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $120 guarantees me my minimum profit and ensures a swift transaction.  The risk of further negotiation with Bob doesn't seem worthwhile at this point.

While I would like to get a better price from Bob, the time constraint and the certainty of John's offer make selling to John the most sensible option at this point."
