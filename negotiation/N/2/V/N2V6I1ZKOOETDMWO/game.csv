"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $170? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",170.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $170 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $185?  This gives you a good price, and gets me closer to my desired value.",185.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $185 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $175? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a fair deal.",175.0,Bob,4,
