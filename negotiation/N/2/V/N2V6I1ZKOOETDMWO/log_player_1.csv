Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product name] and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $200, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $170? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $170 is still too low for me. I want to try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $170 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $185?  This gives you a good price, and gets me closer to my desired value."", ""product_price"": 185}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $185 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $175? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $175 isn't my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum and I'm running out of rounds. There's a chance I might not get a better offer, and I don't want to risk selling to John for $150."
