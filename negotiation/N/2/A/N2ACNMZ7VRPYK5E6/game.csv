"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $11,500. This is a great opportunity to acquire a product worth significantly more, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $10,500?  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit far off from my budget. How about $9,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay under $10,000.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I hear you on the budget, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to go to $10,200.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay under $10,000. How about $9,900? I'm confident that's a fair price for the product.",9900.0,Bob,6,
