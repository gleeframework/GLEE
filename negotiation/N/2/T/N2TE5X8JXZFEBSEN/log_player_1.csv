Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I am only able to offer $12000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $12,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get more.  I'm going to try to negotiate higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm going to need a bit more than $12,000 to make this work.  How about $17,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 17000}

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next rounds. I'm going to accept it."
