It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  $9,000 is a good starting point, but there's room to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I have to consider the value I've put into this product. How about we meet in the middle at $8250? I think that's a fair compromise.

While $8,250 is closer to my ideal price, I still think I can get a better deal.  I'll try one more counteroffer."

$8,100 is a good price, and it's getting very close to my counteroffer.  It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiations and the risk of Alice walking away."
