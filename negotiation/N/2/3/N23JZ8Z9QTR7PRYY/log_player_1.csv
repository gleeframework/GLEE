Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,100,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my asking price."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also not afraid to walk away and sell to John if I need to."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've had enough of these back and forth negotiations with Bob.  He's not budging on his price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
