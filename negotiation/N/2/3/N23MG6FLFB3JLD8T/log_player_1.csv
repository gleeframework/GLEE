"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Leaving Room:** By not starting at $1,200,000, I signal that I'm open to negotiation, which is crucial for a successful deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob and encouraging open communication."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I can get out of this product. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good profit, it's a significant drop from my initial ask. Bob's offer indicates he's willing to negotiate, and I believe I can still secure a better price.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a significant deviation from my initial proposal.  This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price closer to $1,050,000 is more reflective of that. Would you be open to considering this revised figure?"",
""product_price"": 1050000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's price but holding firm above $1,000,000. This signals willingness to compromise while still aiming high. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **Open-Ended:** I'm asking if Bob is ""open to considering"" to keep the negotiation open and avoid a hard ""no."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, Alice, and I appreciate the revised offer. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is a strong deal. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and provides a substantial profit. 

While I could push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting now ensures a successful sale at a very favorable price."
