Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above that.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**The offered price of $1,100,000 is a strategic starting point:**

* **Attractive to Bob:**  It's significantly less than John is willing to pay and offers Bob a good deal compared to his own valuation.
* **Profitable for Alice:**  It secures a profit of $100,000 over your guaranteed sale price. 
 
This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
