"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the product is worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let's make this happen!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? That way, we both get a fair price and can move forward with the transaction. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I really think that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit off from where I need to be.  Let's try $1,275,000. It's a good compromise for both of us.  What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,275,000, which would be $1,262,500. Can you consider that?",1262500.0,Bob,6,
