"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. I'm asking for $1,750,000, recognizing its potential for your company.

"I appreciate the value you see in this product, Alice, but I have to be mindful of our budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $1,200,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value to my business. Can you consider this price?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 simply doesn't come close to covering the value I've placed on this product. To be realistic, I need to be at least at $1,400,000 to make this work. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's still fair considering the potential benefits this product offers your business. ",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options. Can you consider this price?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
