"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. I'm asking for $1,750,000, recognizing its potential for your company.  I'm confident this is a price that reflects its worth while still being within a reasonable range for you. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the value you see in this product, Alice, but I have to be mindful of our budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price, but I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $1,200,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value to my business. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is even lower than his previous offer, and it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm increasingly concerned that we won't reach a deal. I'm going to make another counteroffer, but I'm also keeping a close eye on my backup option of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 simply doesn't come close to covering the value I've placed on this product. To be realistic, I need to be at least at $1,400,000 to make this work. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's still fair considering the potential benefits this product offers your business. "", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I've tried to compromise, it seems we're at a stalemate. With only four rounds left, I don't have time to continue negotiating with Bob.  It's best to cut my losses and sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
