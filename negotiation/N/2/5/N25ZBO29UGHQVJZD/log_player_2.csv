Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $1,200,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 simply doesn't come close to covering the value I've placed on this product. To be realistic, I need to be at least at $1,400,000 to make this work. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's still fair considering the potential benefits this product offers your business.
