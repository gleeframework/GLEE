"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product but $1,200,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Given my understanding of the market value and the product's utility to me, I'd be willing to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
