"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is still too high for him, and he wants to see if he can get a better deal from Alice.  He has 9 more rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is $1,000 less than Alice's initial offer. This is a significant enough reduction to show Bob is serious about negotiating, but it's still within the range where Alice might be willing to accept.  He's aiming for a price closer to Alice's value, but wants to leave room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer slightly from the previous round, but it's still above Bob's desired price. He has 7 rounds remaining to negotiate, so there's still time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly, showing that he's willing to compromise. He's still significantly below Alice's last offer, but he's getting closer to a deal. He has 6 rounds left, so he's willing to test the waters and see if Alice is willing to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  While he has fewer rounds left (5),  the gap between his desired price and Alice's offer is still substantial. He's not desperate enough to accept a price that's too high, and wants to see if he can still convince Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing that he's willing to compromise. He's still significantly below Alice's last offer, but he's getting closer to a deal. He has 4 rounds left, so he needs to start closing the gap. He's aiming for a price that is closer to Alice's value, but still allows him to save some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  He's only got 3 rounds left, so time is running out, but he's still determined to get a better price.  He's getting closer to a deal, but he's not willing to overpay.  He'll try one more counteroffer to see if he can get Alice to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final counteroffer.  He's pushing the limits, going higher than his previous offers, but still hoping to get a good deal.  He's only got 2 rounds left, and needs to convince Alice to accept his offer. He's willing to split the difference between his last offer and Alice's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only one round left, and Alice's offer of $11,000 is still too high.  He's only willing to pay $12,000 at most for the product. It's better to buy the product from John for $12,000 and avoid the risk of not being able to close the deal with Alice."
