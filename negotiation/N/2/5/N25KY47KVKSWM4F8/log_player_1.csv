Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

While $1,050,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 8 rounds left and the option to sell to John for my desired price.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
