I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still have time to negotiate and I'm hoping to get a little bit more.  I don't want to risk losing out on more potential gains by selling to John yet."

I'm selling to John. Bob's offers are getting lower, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, he'll walk away, and I won't get a better price.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, it makes sense to sell to him now and avoid any further risk of getting a lower price."
