"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little bit.  To be honest, $825,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could go as high as $750,000.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still interested in making a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $750,000. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go a bit further and meet you at $785,000. This is my final concession, so I hope you can meet me here.",785000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the movement.  How about we settle at $770,000 and call it a deal?",770000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $780,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. This is my last concession, so I hope you can meet me here.",780000.0,Alice,7,
