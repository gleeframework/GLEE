"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for your product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $900000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $950000 just won't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1000000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, but it's still a good value for you. Let's seal the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
