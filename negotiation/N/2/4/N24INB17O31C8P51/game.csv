"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $1100000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $1150000?  This price is still well within your budget and gives me a reasonable profit.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $1080000 is simply too low for me at this point. I'm willing to drop my price a little further, but only if you come up to $1120000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. What do you say?",1120000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with your offer. It's time for us to get serious.  If you're truly interested in this product, I'm willing to go down to $1100000, but that's my final offer.  This is a significant price point for me, and I won't go any lower.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
