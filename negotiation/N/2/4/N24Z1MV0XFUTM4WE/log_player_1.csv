"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than what I believe the product is truly worth.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. To show my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

This is getting frustrating. Bob seems unwilling to budge much, and we're only a few rounds away from my deadline.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed deal, and while it's not my ideal price, it's better than risking nothing with Bob."
