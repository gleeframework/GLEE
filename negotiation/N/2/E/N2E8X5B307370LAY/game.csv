"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  While $600,000 is significantly lower than I had in mind, I am open to negotiation.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? I'm confident this price reflects a more accurate valuation of the product's potential.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,800,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable paying.  To be honest, I'm thinking closer to $700,000 would be reasonable.  What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,
