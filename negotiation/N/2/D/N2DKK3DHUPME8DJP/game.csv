"Alice,  $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while still leaving room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a good profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I still need to stay within my budget.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
