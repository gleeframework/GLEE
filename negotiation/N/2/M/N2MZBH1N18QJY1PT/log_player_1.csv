{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping for a successful negotiation. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is below my minimum, I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. $140 is a bit too low for me. How about $160? That's still a fair price for a product that's worth $150 to you."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, hoping to show flexibility and move towards an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $155? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $155 is very close to my minimum price of $150, and it's a good deal for both of us.  It's time to close the deal."
