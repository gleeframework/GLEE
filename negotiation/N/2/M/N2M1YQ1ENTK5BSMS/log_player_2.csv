Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $8,500?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product incredibly valuable.  What do you say?

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500. It's better to buy from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
