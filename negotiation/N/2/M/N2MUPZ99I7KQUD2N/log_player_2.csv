"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is less than John's price, you can likely get a better deal from Alice. By rejecting the offer, you signal that the price is too high and encourage her to propose a lower one."
