Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I know it's valuable to you, so I'm proposing a price of $120.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room for negotiation above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Targeting Higher Profit:** Starting with a higher offer ($120) allows room for negotiation downwards if Bob counters.  It aims to secure a price closer to his maximum valuation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a backup buyer (John) at $80, ensuring you won't be left with nothing if Bob declines.

**Important:**  This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit. If Bob rejects this offer, you can always propose a lower price in a subsequent message."
