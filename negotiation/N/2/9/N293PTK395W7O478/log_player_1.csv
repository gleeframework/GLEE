Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefit it will bring to your operations."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $1,100,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $100,000, a strong incentive for him to accept.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup at $800,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach. Negotiation is dynamic.  You could:

* **Start Higher:** Begin at $1,150,000 and be prepared to negotiate down slightly.
* **Highlight Value:**  Clearly articulate the specific benefits Bob will gain from the product to justify the price."
