"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'll sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $90, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $92.50. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's worth considering.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we settle at $91? That's a good deal for both of us and would leave us both feeling good about the transaction.",91.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $91 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you at $92. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",92.0,Alice,7,
