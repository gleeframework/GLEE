"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $80 is below my minimum value for the product. I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $115 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could we do $95? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll try to negotiate further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $95 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I think that's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close!  I can tell you're serious about selling this, and I am interested, but I have a firm budget.  How about $100 even?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum price, it's better than selling to John for the same amount and it allows me to close the deal without further negotiation."
