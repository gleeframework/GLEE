"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to get a better price. You can still potentially get it for less than $8,000 from Alice, or you have the option to go to John if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500. This is still a great price for you, considering the product's value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's still worth trying to negotiate further with Alice.  You can likely get the price down closer to your $8,000 target.  Even if the negotiation fails, you still have the option to buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? It's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
