"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $135, which is a bit closer to my minimum price, but still a good deal for you. Would you be willing to meet me at $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the adjustment, Alice. Unfortunately, I'm still not able to meet at $135. Could we perhaps find a middle ground at $120, which is my maximum budget?",120.0,Bob,4,
