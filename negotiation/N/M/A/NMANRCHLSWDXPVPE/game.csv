"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $135 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $142.50? That's a fair price for both of us.",142.5,Alice,3,,

I'm still not convinced that $142.50 is a good deal for me. How about we try $130? That's as high as I'm willing to go.,130.0,Bob,4,,
