{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I'm willing to accept to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value for Bob:**  $175 is still below the value Bob places on the product ($80), so there's a chance he'll accept.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have a backup buyer (John) at $150 gives me leverage to negotiate. 

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and use my knowledge of his value and John's offer to determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum ($150), it's still below the value I'm aiming for.
* **Leverage:**  I have the option to sell to John for $150, giving me leverage to push for a higher price.
* **Next Round:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my target price, potentially securing a better deal. 

I will counteroffer with a price closer to $150 to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $135 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $142.50? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 142.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By offering $142.50, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Midpoint:**  This offer is exactly halfway between my initial offer of $175 and Bob's counteroffer of $135.
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as fair to both parties, increasing the chances of acceptance.

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $150, as there might not be much room for further negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $142.50 is a good deal for me. How about we try $130? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **No Room for Negotiation:**  Bob has stated he won't go higher, leaving little room for further negotiation.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is a better deal than accepting Bob's offer.

While I'd prefer to sell for a higher price, securing a guaranteed profit with John is the most sensible choice at this point."
