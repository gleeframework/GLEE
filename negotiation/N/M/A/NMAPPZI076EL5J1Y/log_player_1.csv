Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm emphasizing the potential value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offer:** I'm prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides a baseline for my negotiation. I won't accept any offer less than $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  While Bob's initial counter-offer is low, it shows he's still interested in the product. There's potential for negotiation.
* **John is a strong backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $10,000 is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. It shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Re-emphasize value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to potentially sway him.
* **Keeping it positive:**  I'm avoiding accusatory language and keeping the tone positive to maintain a good relationship.
* **Staying above minimum:** My offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000,  knowing I can sell to John if this negotiation fails."
