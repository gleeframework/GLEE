"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,250, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer the product to you for $10,000, which is the price I was originally willing to sell it to John for. This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
