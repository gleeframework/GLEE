"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $150. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go down to $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $137.50 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $137.50 is still within your budget and is a decent compromise. It's likely that further negotiation will only result in small price reductions, and there's a risk of Alice getting frustrated and ending the deal.  It's better to accept this offer and get the product."
