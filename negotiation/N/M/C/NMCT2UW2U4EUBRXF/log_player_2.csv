"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $15,000 is above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000. It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer of $8,000,  which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price of $15,000.  This gives him room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price he's comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice has lowered her price to $13,000, which is closer to Bob's budget but still higher than what he's willing to pay. It's still worth trying to negotiate further, so Bob should reject the offer and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

Bob is increasing his offer to $9,500. This is still below Alice's $13,000 offer but closer to his budget. It shows he's willing to negotiate but also maintains some leverage. He's hoping Alice will accept this offer or come back with a counteroffer closer to his price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice has lowered her price to $12,500, which is still above Bob's budget but closer to what he's willing to pay. He's still hoping to get the price lower. It's still worth trying to negotiate further, so Bob should reject the offer and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

Bob is increasing his offer again to $11,000. This is a significant step closer to Alice's offer of $12,500, showing he's serious about buying the product but still trying to get the best price.  He's hoping Alice will accept this offer or counter with a price that's within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer of $12,200 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his comfort zone. He can get the same product from John for $10,000. However, there's a good chance Alice will accept a counteroffer closer to $11,000, which would be a better deal than John's offer.  Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and try to counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

Bob is increasing his offer one last time to $11,500. This is a small increase from his previous offer, showing he's getting closer to Alice's price but still trying to get the best deal. He's hoping Alice will accept this offer, as it's a fair compromise and allows him to save money compared to John's price. If Alice rejects, Bob will likely accept her offer and buy from her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob has reached his limit. Alice is clearly not willing to budge on her price, which is still above what Bob considers a reasonable value. It's time to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $10,000, which is still within his budget and guarantees him the product."
