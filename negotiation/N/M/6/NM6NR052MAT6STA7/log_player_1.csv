I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $1,350,000 is a lot closer to my minimum, I think I can still push for a higher price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,360,000 is still above my minimum and a good outcome for me. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer and then having to sell to John for a lower price."
