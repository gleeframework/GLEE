"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a good price, it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower. There's a good chance she's hoping for a higher price, and we can leverage the negotiation to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $1,000.  This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal and sets the stage for potential negotiation. I'm leaving room to potentially compromise further if needed, but this initial counteroffer shows a willingness to be firm."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my counteroffer, but $8,200 is still above my preferred price point. I'm going to reject and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target of $7,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $7,800. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on getting a lower price than her last offer. I believe this counteroffer is within a reasonable range and could potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,100 is still above my preferred price point. While it's closer to my initial target, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.  There are still 5 rounds remaining, and I'm willing to continue pushing for a lower price.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer than my previous one in the hopes of finding a meeting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7900}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $7,900.  This is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway.  At this point, I'm hoping she'll accept the offer, as we are closer to an agreement. However, if she rejects, I still have more rounds to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,000, which is a good price, considering my initial target was $7,500.  While I could try to negotiate further, we are in the later rounds of negotiation and there's a risk Alice might get stubborn. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a reasonable price and avoids the risk of running out of rounds or needing to buy from John at a higher price."
