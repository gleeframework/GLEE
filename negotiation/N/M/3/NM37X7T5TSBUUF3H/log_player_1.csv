Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive and friendly:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Not too aggressive:**  While I'm aiming for the best price, I'm not being overly aggressive in my initial offer. This is important for keeping the negotiation open and avoiding a quick rejection. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $85.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even below the value I know the product has for me. 
* **Negotiation room:** There's still room for negotiation. While Bob is willing to pay more than his initial valuation, there's potential for a better deal for me. 
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and can try to get a higher price in the next round.

I'll counteroffer to Bob and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is just a little too low for me. How about $100?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that is closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial valuation.  This demonstrates flexibility while trying to secure a decent profit.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing that $100 is still a good deal for Bob, highlighting the product's worth to him. 
* **Friendly tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation positive and encourages further discussion.

Let's see if Bob is ready to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to split the difference with you and pay $92.50. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for better deal:** There's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I can try to push for a higher price.
* **Don't settle too early:** It's better to try for a slightly better deal rather than settling for a price I'm not completely satisfied with. 

I'll counteroffer to Bob and aim for a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work.  $92.50 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price of $100.  Would you be willing to meet me at $97.50?  That would be a fair compromise and would ensure we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a good price.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing that this deal would be fair for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:** Keeping the communication positive and friendly can help keep the negotiation going. 

Let's see if Bob is ready to seal the deal!"
