"Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is just a little too low for me. How about $100?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good price.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to split the difference with you and pay $92.50. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work.  $92.50 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price of $100.  Would you be willing to meet me at $97.50?  That would be a fair compromise and would ensure we both get a good deal.",97.5,Alice,5,
