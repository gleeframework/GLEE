"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your starting price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to offer $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $725,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $775,000 is getting closer, but to be honest, my budget is capped at $750,000.  If you can make that work, I'm ready to close the deal. ",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that $750,000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $765,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",765000.0,Alice,7,
