"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for less than $10,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best choice at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to consider your product at $8,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the opportunity open to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? This would allow both of us to walk away happy with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500 is too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,000. How about we settle on $9,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has moved closer to your desired price point.  Accepting the offer for $9,750 saves you $2,250 compared to buying from John, and it's a better price than any previous offer from Alice.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance Alice won't budge further, and you risk losing the deal altogether."
