"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I know I can potentially get it for a better price, either from Alice or from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's value ($10,000) than to my maximum ($12,000).  This gives me room to negotiate upwards if needed, while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to my desired price range, but I think there's still room for negotiation.  I'm willing to see if I can get a better deal before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. How about $10,800? That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 10800
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm inching closer to her offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price below $11,000. This keeps the pressure on Alice while staying within a reasonable range of my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,900? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $10,900 is a good price â€“ a $1,100 savings compared to John's offer. It's getting close to the point where further haggling might make me lose the deal altogether."
