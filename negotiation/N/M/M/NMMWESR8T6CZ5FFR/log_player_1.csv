{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price point ($20,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a good profit. The message is friendly and open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer.  This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a higher price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $15000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, I'm not willing to sell for the minimum value just yet. I believe there's potential to negotiate further with Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm aiming for a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This counteroffer shows flexibility while still maintaining a significant profit margin. The message emphasizes fairness and encourages Bob to reconsider his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. I would like to counter with $16000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $16,000 is only $1,000 less than my last counteroffer.  Given that this is still above my minimum value of $15,000, I'm willing to accept his offer and sell the product to Bob. This ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing a sale."
