Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's the price I'm looking for, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.

You have three options:
