Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my limits. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?

Round 6
Bob's offer:

This is a significant compromise, but it's the absolute maximum I can afford.  If you're serious about selling, I think we can make this work.  What do you say?

**Reasoning:**

Bob is highly unlikely to meet my minimum price. He's incrementally increasing his offers, but at this rate, we're still far apart with several rounds left. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
