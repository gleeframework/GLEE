"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my limits. Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $900,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the value you'll gain from the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your persistence. I understand you're working within a budget, but the value of this product is substantial. I could consider letting it go for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I have other interested parties.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still working within a tight budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a significant compromise, but it's the absolute maximum I can afford.  If you're serious about selling, I think we can make this work.  What do you say?",975000.0,Bob,6,
