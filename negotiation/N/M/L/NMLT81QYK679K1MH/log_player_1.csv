"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate. 
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone is crucial for building rapport and potentially securing a better deal. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I highlight the product's value to emphasize why the price is justified.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk/Reward:**  There is a risk Bob rejects this initial offer.  However, it's better to start high and potentially negotiate down than start too low and miss out on maximizing profits. 
* **John's Offer:** Remember, I can always sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails. This provides a safety net.
* **Future Rounds:** I'll adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response in the subsequent rounds."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $850,000 is a good price, I want to try and squeeze a bit more out of Bob if possible. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  There are still 8 rounds left. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue the negotiation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential for a better deal outweighs the risk of losing a few thousand dollars by rejecting Bob's offer.
* **John's Safety Net:** I can always sell to John for $800,000 if this negotiation completely falls apart.

**Next Round:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I will likely aim for $875,000 or $880,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about $875,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Balance:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still giving me room to negotiate further if necessary.

* **More Room to Negotiate:** We're still early in the negotiation process. I believe there's room for us to come to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John's Backup:** I am confident I can get a better price than $850,000, but I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000 if necessary.

**Next Round:**

I will counteroffer with $865,000.  It's a smaller step than my previous counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a better price than Bob's current offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close, but $840,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about $855,000?  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away happy.  Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 855000}

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** Remember, I can always sell to John for $800,000 if this deal doesn't work out.
* **Remaining Rounds:** With only three rounds left, it's getting close to the point where selling to John might be the safer option.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $830000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $830,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:** Bob's offer of $830,000 is getting dangerously close to John's price. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** With only two rounds remaining, there's a high risk that Bob will continue to lower his offers, potentially forcing me to accept a price lower than John's.
* **Time Pressure:** It's better to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John than risk a lower offer from Bob in the next round.

**Conclusion:**

While I would have preferred to get a higher price from Bob, it's not worth risking losing more money by continuing the negotiation. Selling to John at $800,000 is the most sensible decision given the current situation."
