"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $7500 for it. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $7500 is lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8500? It's still a good deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $8500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $8000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
