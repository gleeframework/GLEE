"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is within your budget, you can try to get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her product's value of $120. If she doesn't budge, you still have the option to buy from John for $150."
