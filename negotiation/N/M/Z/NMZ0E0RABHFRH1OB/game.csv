"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,000 is tempting, it's too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I can't go any lower than $8,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal, I'm confident you won't regret it.",8250.0,Alice,5,
