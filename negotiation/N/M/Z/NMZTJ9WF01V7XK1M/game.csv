"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it will bring to your operations.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to something in that range.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, my initial valuation was based on the substantial value this product brings.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the potential benefits it holds for your business.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I could maybe justify going up to $1,250,000. It's a strong offer, and I'm eager to get this deal done. What do you say?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Your offer is strong, but to be completely transparent, it falls a bit short of what I need to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,475,000? This represents a significant compromise from my original asking price and reflects my desire to get this deal done.",1475000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I can see you're trying to make this work, and I appreciate that.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and land at $1,362,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1362500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this, and I agree that we're very close to a deal that benefits us both.  I've considered your proposal carefully, and to be completely transparent,  $1,400,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go.  It's a firm offer, but I believe it represents a fair compromise and reflects the true value of this product.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
