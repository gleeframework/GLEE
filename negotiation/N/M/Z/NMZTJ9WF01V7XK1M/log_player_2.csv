Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, my initial valuation was based on the substantial value this product brings.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Your offer is strong, but to be completely transparent, it falls a bit short of what I need to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,475,000? This represents a significant compromise from my original asking price and reflects my desire to get this deal done.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this, and I agree that we're very close to a deal that benefits us both.  I've considered your proposal carefully, and to be completely transparent,  $1,400,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go.  It's a firm offer, but I believe it represents a fair compromise and reflects the true value of this product.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,400,000.  While you might be able to negotiate her down a bit more, it's not worth the risk of losing the product altogether. John's offer of $1,200,000 guarantees you the product at your maximum budget.  It's time to cut your losses with Alice and secure the deal with John."
