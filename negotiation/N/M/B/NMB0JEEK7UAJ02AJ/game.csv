"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
