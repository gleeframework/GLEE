"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit hesitant to pay $12,000. Considering its value, I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  How about meeting halfway at $10,500? This would represent a fair compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the value of the product and the market, I'm willing to offer $9,800. I think this is a more reasonable price for both of us. What do you think?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $9,800 is still too low for me to consider. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it would benefit you greatly. My final offer is $10,200. This is a firm price, and I believe it's more than fair. ",10200.0,Alice,5,
