Alice's offer:

# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now willing to sell it to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

At this point, Alice has drawn a line in the sand.  While I could try to push further, there's a risk she walks away entirely. $825,000 is still a significant savings over John's price, and it's unlikely I can get much lower."
