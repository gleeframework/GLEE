"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you be open to $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $9,750 is still a bit below my desired price.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,125? This is a fair price that considers both of our needs.  Let's make this deal happen!",10125.0,Alice,5,
