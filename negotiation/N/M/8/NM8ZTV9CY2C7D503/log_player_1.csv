"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to build rapport.  I'm hoping this initial offer will be attractive enough for Bob to consider, but also leaves room for me to potentially get closer to my minimum price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  It's below my minimum price of $12,000 and significantly lower than my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to be closer to my minimum value.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500, which is halfway between my initial offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and framing this as a fair price.  I believe this counteroffer will make Bob more likely to accept and hopefully get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you be open to $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While he's getting closer, it's still below my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to my target. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $9,750 is still a bit below my desired price.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,125? This is a fair price that considers both of our needs.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10125}
```

I'm again splitting the difference between my previous offer of $10,500 and Bob's offer of $9,750. I'm being more assertive in my message, emphasizing the need to ""make this deal happen.""  I'm hoping this will create a sense of urgency and motivate Bob to accept."
