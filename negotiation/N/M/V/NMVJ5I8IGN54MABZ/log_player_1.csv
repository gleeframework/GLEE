{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price point of $120. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}

I'm going to try to push a little harder with Bob. $85 is still below my minimum, but I want to see if we can find common ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $87.50 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell below $90. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can finalize the deal."

Round 7

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting very close to my minimum price, but Bob is still not willing to meet me halfway.  I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $120. It's not ideal, but it's better than settling for a price that's too low."
