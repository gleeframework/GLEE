"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,750,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering the value we both see in this opportunity.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. It's important that we both find a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. My new offer is $1,650,000. This shows my commitment to making this deal work, while still ensuring I receive a fair return on this unique product.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
