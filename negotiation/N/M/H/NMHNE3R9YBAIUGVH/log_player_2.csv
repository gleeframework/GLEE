"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's definitely room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can start the counter-offer process and try to get a lower price. He has 10 rounds to work with, so there's no need to rush into a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target price, but there is still some room for negotiation.  While Alice is willing to meet ""halfway"" at $1,050,000, Bob can continue to try and push for a lower price. He has 7 rounds remaining to negotiate and doesn't need to accept the first offer that gets him closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your need to make a profit, Alice, and I'm happy to work with you on this.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's compromise at $1,025,000. I believe this price is fair to both of us and ensures a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1025000, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at $1030000? This is a fair price that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,030,000 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $1,025,000.  This means they are very close to a deal. Since Bob has only 5 rounds left, it's time to accept the offer and avoid risking losing the deal altogether."
