"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,400,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:** I can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and counter-offering. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Alice fail, I have the option of buying from John, although it's not my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** My counteroffer is $100,000 lower than Alice's initial price. This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying, but I'm also pushing for a better deal.
* **Within my budget:** $1,300,000 is comfortably within my $1,500,000 limit, leaving some room for further negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see how far she's willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise, splitting the difference between our previous offers.
* **Within budget:** This price is still within my budget of $1,500,000.
* **Time is of the essence:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible, or I might run out of rounds. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
