Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, and hopefully still allows me to get a price significantly higher than my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'm confident in the value of my product and believe it's worth more to Bob than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not going to accept it right away. I'll try to get a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's lowball offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation, but I'm showing that I'm willing to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has moved closer to my desired price.  While I'd like to push for more, accepting $1,600,000 is a good outcome, significantly exceeding my minimum.  There's always a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower price, and selling to John would only net me $1,500,000.  It's time to close the deal."
