"Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $17000, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I think we're very close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $17000, but I'd like to add a condition: I'll throw in some additional services and support worth $1000 for free, so the total value you'll get is still higher than my initial offer. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,9,
