"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while also ensuring I get a good deal.  I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, and I'm ready to negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $9,000, showing flexibility while still holding out for a good deal.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

I'm lowering my price again, this time to $8900. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  We're nearing the end of the rounds, so I need to start closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. I'm only $100 away from my desired price, and we're nearing the end of the rounds.  It's unlikely that Bob will offer more, and selling to John would mean losing $800.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
