Round 7
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down, we're still above our absolute limit of $800,000.  We have a few rounds left to negotiate, and walking away to John is always an option. A firm counteroffer might push Alice closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However,  $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. My final offer is $780,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 780000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  This counteroffer stays below our $800,000 limit but is a significant jump from the previous offer, showing Alice we're serious.
* **Introducing scarcity:** By mentioning ""other options,"" we remind Alice that we have a backup plan (John) without directly threatening to walk away. 
* **Finality:** Calling it our ""final offer"" adds weight and might encourage Alice to make a decision this round."
