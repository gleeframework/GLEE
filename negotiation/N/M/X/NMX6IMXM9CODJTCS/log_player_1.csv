Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, I believe $1,000,000 is a bit high. I'm prepared to offer $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations.  I'd be willing to move to $700,000 to find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

We're still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to continue negotiating with Bob for a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm also confident in the value this product holds.  Let's meet in the middle - $850,000. This reflects my willingness to compromise while still recognizing the product's worth."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground.  How about $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

We're now very close to John's offer, but there's still room for Bob to potentially meet or exceed it. It's worth one more counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $825,000. I believe this fairly reflects the value you'll gain from this product."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However,  $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. My final offer is $780,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $780,000 is below John's standing offer of $800,000. It's unlikely Bob will go higher and we risk him walking away. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best possible outcome at this point."
