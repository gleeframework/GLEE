You are still closer to your goal price of $95 than Alice's offer of $102.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can get Alice to come down to your price."

You have negotiated with Alice as much as you can, and you're still $6 away from your ideal price.  It's better to buy the product from John for $120 than to continue negotiating with Alice."
