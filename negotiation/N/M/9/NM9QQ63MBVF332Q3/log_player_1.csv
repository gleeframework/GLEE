Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its significant value proposition."", ""product_price"": 925000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000. We want to capture as much of that potential profit as possible. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting high ($925,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Value Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique"" and ""valuable"" aspects subtly emphasizes why the price is justified.

This approach aims for the best-case scenario while acknowledging the strong fallback option of selling to John."
