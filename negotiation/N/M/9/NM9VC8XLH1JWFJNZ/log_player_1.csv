Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you aim to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer,  while still ensuring you make a significant profit. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $120 to Bob, knowing his valuation is lower, might seem unfair and discourage negotiation."
