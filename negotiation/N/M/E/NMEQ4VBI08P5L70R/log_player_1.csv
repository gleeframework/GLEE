Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product which I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** While the price is above Bob's perceived value, it doesn't seem outrageous. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a premium if he finds the product valuable enough. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000. This gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and any counter-offers he might make."
