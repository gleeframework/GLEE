"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? It's a fair price and I'm ready to buy right away.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 just doesn't work for me. How about $12,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a profit while giving you a great deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I have a firm budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,250 still doesn't quite work for me. Let's try $12,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
