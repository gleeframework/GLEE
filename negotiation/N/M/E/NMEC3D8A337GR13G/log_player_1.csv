"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation but still keeping a significant profit margin for myself. I'm also being positive and friendly to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? It's a fair price and I'm ready to buy right away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to sell for $10,000, as that would be significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 just doesn't work for me. How about $12,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a profit while giving you a great deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I have a firm budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough.  I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,250 still doesn't quite work for me. Let's try $12,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
