Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,150,000. This is a good strategy because:

* **It's a good deal for Bob:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he's still getting a good deal at $1,150,000. This increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer.
* **It's a good deal for me:** I'm getting significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $1,000,000, so there's no downside to this offer.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping Bob happy enough to accept the offer."
