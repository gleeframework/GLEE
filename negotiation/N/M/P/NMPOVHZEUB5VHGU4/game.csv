"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I'd receive from another buyer. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $1,100,000 is my final offer - if you can't do that, I'm afraid I'll have to go with John.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
