"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,900,000 is unfortunately above my budget. Given the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair considering my maximum budget and the potential of the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,900,000 represents the high-end of its value, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $1,650,000? This considers both our positions and reflects the true potential of this product.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,400,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will allow us to reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
