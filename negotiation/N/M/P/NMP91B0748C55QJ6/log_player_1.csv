Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,900,000 is unfortunately above my budget. Given the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair considering my maximum budget and the potential of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,900,000 represents the high-end of its value, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $1,650,000? This considers both our positions and reflects the true potential of this product."", ""product_price"": 1650000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,400,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will allow us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Bob is firmly rooted at $1,400,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge this gap. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive the product's full value at $1,500,000."
