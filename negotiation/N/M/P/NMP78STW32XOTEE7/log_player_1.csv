"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still within a range where I believe there's a chance he'll accept. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This initial offer gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, but it also sets the initial bar high, making it more likely I'll get closer to my desired price. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's clearly interested in the product. This means there's room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better price.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:** While $150 is a guaranteed sale, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer but not dropping below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain value:** $160 is still a good price for me, reflecting the product's worth and leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and focusing on the benefits of the deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer:** Bob's offer of $140 is now getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **More negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to get to a price that's more favorable for me.  
* **John is a safety net:**  While I want to close the deal with Bob if possible, selling to John for $150 is a solid fallback option if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a compromise that's exactly halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's last offer. This shows a genuine willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Finality:** I'm framing this as a final offer, suggesting that I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  I'm emphasizing that $150 is a fair price for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to walking away, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're halfway through the rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I don't believe there's enough room for further negotiation to reach a price that's good for me.
* **Guaranteed sale with John:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and it's a safe bet given the remaining rounds.  
* **Risk of losing out:**  There's a chance Bob might continue to decline my offers, and I could end up with a lower price or even no sale at all. 

I'm choosing to sell to John now to ensure I get a fair price and avoid any further risk."
