"Bob, I'm offering you my product for a very competitive price of $1,400,000.  This is a fantastic opportunity for you, as it's significantly lower than the estimated value of $1,500,000 you placed on it.  I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. However, I have another buyer lined up at $1,200,000, so I need to know your decision soon.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
