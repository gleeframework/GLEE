"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" of the product to justify the high initial price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** By stating ""I'm open to discussing further,"" you signal that this is a starting point and you're willing to find a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:** There's a chance Bob might accept the initial high offer.
2. **Set an Anchor:** Even if rejected, this high starting point sets a reference point for subsequent negotiations. 
3. **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:**  His response will indicate how interested he is in the product and how much he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum ($1,500,000). You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John guarantees your minimum.  There's room to work towards a price that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but I need to be closer to $1,900,000 for this to make sense for me.  This product offers significant advantages, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're coming down from our initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate. However, the reduction is substantial enough to show Bob we're serious.
* **Holding Firm (for now):** The new price is still significantly above both Bob's offer and your minimum. This maintains pressure on Bob to justify his valuation while keeping you in a strong position.
* **Positive Tone:** We're keeping the conversation collaborative. The message emphasizes finding a ""win-win"" solution, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches your minimum acceptable price. While you could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee of reaching a better deal. Accepting now secures your desired profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
