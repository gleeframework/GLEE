"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $11,000. I understand that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
