Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $14,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.

While negotiating with Bob might yield a slightly higher price, it's becoming clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum. John's offer guarantees me $15,000, which is my baseline. It's time to cut my losses and secure a good deal with John."
