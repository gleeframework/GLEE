"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $20,000 represents the high end of its value, $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could we meet at $18,000? I'm willing to compromise if we can find a fair price.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $14,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
