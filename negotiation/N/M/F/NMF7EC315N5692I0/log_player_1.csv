"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate down.  I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage and hopefully, get him to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for your product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, my goal is to maximize profits. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to meet you halfway. This is still a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the value I place on this product.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 matches the value I place on the product, and I'm happy to close the deal at this price.  There's no need to risk further negotiation."
