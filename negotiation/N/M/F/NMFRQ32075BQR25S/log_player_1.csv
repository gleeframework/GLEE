Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for a product worth much more! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  At $100, it's still a good deal for Bob as he values it at $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without immediately reaching a deal at your minimum price.
* **It doesn't immediately alienate Bob:** A higher price might make him walk away right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $90 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to go up to $80, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's try $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $80. Can you meet me at that price or is there a reason you can't sell it to me for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's clear that Bob isn't willing to go higher than $80. While that's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120, which is a much better deal for me."
