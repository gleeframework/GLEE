"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for the product.",8200.0,Alice,5,
