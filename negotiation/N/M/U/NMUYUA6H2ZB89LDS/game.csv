"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that starting price is quite high. While I recognize the value of the product, I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite far apart on price.  To be frank, $750,000 is less than I would consider acceptable. To move this forward, I'm willing to drop to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it reflects my strong interest in closing a deal with you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's make this simple: I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This is a strong offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting close. Your offer is tempting, and I appreciate you moving in the right direction.  However, to make this worthwhile for me, I need to see a price of $1,100,000.  This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
