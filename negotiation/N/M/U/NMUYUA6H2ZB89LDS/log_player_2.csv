Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $750,000?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite far apart on price.  To be frank, $750,000 is less than I would consider acceptable. To move this forward, I'm willing to drop to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it reflects my strong interest in closing a deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's make this simple: I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This is a strong offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we are getting close. Your offer is tempting, and I appreciate you moving in the right direction.  However, to make this worthwhile for me, I need to see a price of $1,100,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer. While she might be bluffing, she's clearly not budging much below $1,100,000.  It's very unlikely we'll get her down to a price that makes staying in the negotiation worth the risk. John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, which is a better deal than Alice's final offer."
