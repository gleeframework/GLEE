"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm for this product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $12000? I believe this is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $13500 is closer, I'm still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $13000?  This would be a great deal for both of us and help us finalize this transaction.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you the product for $13750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.
