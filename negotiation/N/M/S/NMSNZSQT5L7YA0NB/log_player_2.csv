"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that's worth $10,000 to you. I'm willing to make a fair offer of $9,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good price, Bob can likely get it for less. It's worth seeing if Alice will go lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend $8,500, but I'm still a bit below that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $9,200. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target, he still has room to negotiate. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $9,200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to make it more appealing. I'm counteroffering $9,150. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150.

Bob should buy the product from John.  While Alice has come down in price, she's still above Bob's target price.  It's better to secure the product at a slightly higher price from John than risk further negotiations with Alice and potentially losing the opportunity to purchase it."
