(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his budget, and it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob should start by offering the lowest price he's willing to pay. This is his best chance to get a good deal, and it sets the stage for a strong negotiation."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to get a better price.  There are still several rounds remaining, and he can always buy from John if he doesn't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly.  He's showing Alice that he's serious about buying, but he's still pushing for a price that's within his budget. This strategy increases the likelihood of a deal while keeping the pressure on Alice."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,500 is closer to his budget, he can still try to get a better price. He's shown Alice that he's willing to negotiate, and there are still several rounds remaining. By rejecting, he can potentially get closer to his target price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly again, but only by a small amount. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement while also demonstrating that he is unwilling to pay Alice's full asking price. There are only a few rounds remaining, so Bob needs to find a compromise point that is acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While $13,800 is above his target price of $12,000, it's only a small difference.  There's only one round left, and it's unlikely Alice will go lower. Accepting this offer gives Bob the product at a reasonable price, and he'll avoid the risk of ending up with nothing if Alice rejects his counteroffer."
