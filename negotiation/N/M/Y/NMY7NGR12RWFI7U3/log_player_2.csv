"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is very good.** It's significantly lower than your maximum price.
* **There's potential for an even better deal.** By rejecting the offer, you can start a negotiation process and try to push for a lower price.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** You can always go to John if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening counteroffer:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer shows Alice that you are serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer still leaves room for a compromise. 
* **Considering Alice's perspective:**  While this is a low offer, it's still higher than Alice's minimum price. 

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a good deal.** It's lower than your maximum price and closer to your initial counteroffer.
* **There's still potential for a better price.** We can continue negotiating and try to get closer to our desired price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  As before, John provides a safety net if the negotiation fails.

Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a bit more!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Counteroffer:** We're increasing our offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise, but still pushing for a lower price.
* **Testing the waters:**  This offer is a test to see if Alice is willing to move closer to our desired price.
* **Avoiding too aggressive of a move:** A larger jump might make Alice less likely to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise.** It's a little bit lower than your previous counteroffer, but still significantly lower than your maximum price.
* **The deal is getting close.**  There's a good chance that further negotiation won't result in a significantly better price.
* **Risk of losing the deal.** If we keep rejecting offers, there's a chance Alice will walk away, and we'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.

It's time to secure the deal and save a substantial amount of money!"
