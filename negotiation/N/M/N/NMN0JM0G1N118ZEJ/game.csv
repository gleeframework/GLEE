,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,000,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I believe the value of the product will more than justify that price. Let's find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
