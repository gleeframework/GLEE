"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $120 to Alice, but she is offering it for $150. This means she is trying to make a profit of $30.  As a buyer, you are trying to save as much money as possible. You can get the product from John for $100. It makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?

Alice has lowered her price to $130, which is still higher than what you are willing to pay.  You can still get the product for $100 from John.  It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
