"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm Alice, and I have a unique product I think you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to begin negotiations with an offer that's slightly above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's initial reaction.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique"" nature and ""incredible value"" to pique Bob's interest without revealing specifics. 
* **Leaving Room:**  Offering it at $1,400,000 leaves a significant gap between your asking price and both your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This creates space for a potentially fruitful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking for something a bit more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above our minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than his perceived value of the product.  We have room to negotiate and aim for a better outcome. We'll reject this offer and present a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,225,000?"",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Demonstrating Flexibility:** By saying ""willing to meet you halfway,"" we signal a willingness to negotiate while still emphasizing the product's value.
* **Strategic Counter:**  $1,225,000 is the exact midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This presents a seemingly fair compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** We haven't significantly dropped our price, indicating we're serious about getting a fair value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,150,000? I believe that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, but Bob's offer is still below our target. It's clear he's willing to negotiate, and we have time on our side. By rejecting and counter-offering again, we can continue to nudge the price closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a point we can both agree on.  What if we settle on $1,190,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** We start by acknowledging Bob's understanding of the product's value and his efforts in the negotiation, fostering goodwill.
* **Minor Concession:**  We're making a smaller concession this round, only coming down $35,000 from our previous offer. This signals we're reaching a point where major compromises are less likely. 
* **Justification:** We frame the offer as a balanced solution that considers both the product's worth and Bob's interest. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** While we haven't explicitly mentioned John, we want to keep a subtle sense of urgency to encourage Bob to reach a decision sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to go up slightly to $1,170,000.  Hopefully, we can close this out soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,170,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,170,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob's latest offer is quite close to our previous counteroffer, and we're well above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains, while also risking Bob's willingness to continue or potentially even walking away. 
* **Time Factor:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. While we have time, securing the deal sooner rather than later mitigates the risk of Bob losing interest or external factors influencing his decision.

Overall, $1,170,000 is a very good price for the product. Accepting now secures a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
