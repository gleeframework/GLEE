"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'll sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Plus, you'll be getting it from me directly, which means you'll avoid any middlemen fees. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  You should reject Alice's offer and see if she'll come down in price. If not, you'll still save money by going with John."
