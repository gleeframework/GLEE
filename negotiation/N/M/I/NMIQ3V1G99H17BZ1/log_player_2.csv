"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While the product is worth $8,000 to him, Alice's offer of $12,000 is still too high. Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering or buying from John."

# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.
