"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident I can find a better deal elsewhere. However, I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your initial offer. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.
