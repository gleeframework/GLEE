"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to Bob's valuation, while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm going to try to squeeze out a little more.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I believe it's a reasonable price that still gives Bob a good deal, while also getting me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is very close to my desired price. While I could potentially try to squeeze out a little more, the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer and potentially ending up with John's offer of $800,000 is too high.  Accepting his offer is the safest option to ensure I get a good price."
