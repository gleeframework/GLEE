Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first.  I think it would be perfect for your needs and am happy to answer any questions you have. Given its value, I'm offering it at $15,000."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product to me. While I agree it could meet my needs, $15,000 is significantly above my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $6,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is too low.  Let's see if we can negotiate him up.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  While I understand your budget constraints, $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $11,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I could potentially go up to $7,000, but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
