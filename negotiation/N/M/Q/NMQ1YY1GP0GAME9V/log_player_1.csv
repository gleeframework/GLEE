"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 145}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $145 seems a bit high for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $130. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm still losing a significant amount of money compared to what I could get from John.  I'll counteroffer again to see if we can get closer to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $115 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, my budget is firm at $120.  That's the most I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $5 below my minimum acceptable price, but I'm running out of rounds. It's better to sell the product to Bob for $120 than risk losing out on a sale altogether and having to sell to John for $150."
