"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $95. It's a steal considering its value to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're trying to save money, and $95 is still more than the product is worth to you.  It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value to me, but $95 is a bit steep. How about $85?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to purchase it immediately."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 doesn't quite cover my costs. Let's split the difference - how about $90? It's still a great price for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is still above your ideal price but closer to your maximum limit of $100. It's a good compromise, and since you're still saving $10 compared to buying from John, it's worthwhile to accept Alice's offer."
