{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a significant discount from his valuation, while still allowing you to earn a hefty profit.  It also sets the stage for negotiation if he wants to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1300000 is a good price for you, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $1250000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is close enough to my minimum price of $1,200,000 that it's worth accepting.  While I'd prefer more, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
