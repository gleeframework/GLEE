"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm confident I can get closer to that value with more negotiation, or even sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit shy of $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to my target than Bob's previous offers, it's still significantly less than what I need.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, and there are still 6 rounds remaining. There's a good chance I can get a better deal, or even sell to John for my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference - $10,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can finally close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $9,500. How about we try $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now at Round 6, with only 4 rounds remaining. While Bob is inching closer to my desired price, his offer of $9,250 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Given the limited time remaining, and the fact that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my target price, it's more prudent to accept the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
