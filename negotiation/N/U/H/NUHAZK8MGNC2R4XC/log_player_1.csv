Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $110, which is higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Positive opening:** The message is friendly and encourages a conversation.
* **Direct question:**  Asking what Bob thinks directly invites him to respond and engage in the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I create an initial bargaining space.  If Bob rejects the offer, I'm prepared to counter-offer or sell to John for $100 if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $95 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell at that price yet.  My goal is to maximize profit. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to $100. This will give me a better chance of getting a higher price while still keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $105?  It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""both be happy"" maintains a positive tone. 
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my price (closer to my asking price) to make it more understandable to Bob.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise, I aim to show Bob that I'm serious about selling to him but also that I won't settle for a low price.  This will encourage him to consider my offer and hopefully lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original offer of $95. I hope we can come to an agreement that suits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is insistent on $95, which is below my minimum. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, it's more beneficial to sell to John at $100 and avoid further negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time and effort:**  Negotiating further with Bob is unlikely to get me a significantly higher price, and it could take more time and effort.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit of $100.

**Strategy:**

By choosing to sell to John, I prioritize certainty and a guaranteed profit over the potential of a slightly better price from Bob."
