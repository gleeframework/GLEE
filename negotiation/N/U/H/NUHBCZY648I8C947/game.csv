"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $10,500.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is a little lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a little more.  How about $10,750? That's a fair compromise.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,875?  It's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.",10875.0,Alice,5,
