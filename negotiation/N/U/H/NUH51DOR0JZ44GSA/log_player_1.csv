Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a fair price that is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my initial offer, Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum and represents a good deal. Accepting ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation."
