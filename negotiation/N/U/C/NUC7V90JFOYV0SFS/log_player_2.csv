Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but I can't go lower than $120. That's my absolute bottom line.  I believe this product is worth it, and I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reached her bottom line of $120, which is above your maximum budget of $80. There's no point in continuing the negotiation as you won't reach a price you're willing to pay.  It's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from John for $80, ensuring you stay within your budget."
