"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I'm confident it could be even more valuable to the right buyer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a significant price, but I believe in the potential of this product. Consider it carefully and let me know if you're interested.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
