"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. Can you consider this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a fair price for this exceptional product is $900000. Would you be willing to consider this revised offer?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $850000. Can you consider this price?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're continuing the negotiation, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot for the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for the product. I'm thinking of $925000. It's a bit above your last offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession. However, $925000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",875000.0,Bob,6,
