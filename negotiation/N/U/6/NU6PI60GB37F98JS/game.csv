"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $750,000 is closer, but still a bit outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a fair offer, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $710,000? I think that's a very reasonable compromise.",710000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about budget, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $720,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $725,000 and $710,000. I'll sell the product to you for $715,000.",715000.0,Alice,7,
