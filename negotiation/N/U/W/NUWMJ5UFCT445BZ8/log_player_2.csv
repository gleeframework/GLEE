"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm proposing a price of $140 for it. This is a special offer tailored just for you, considering its high worth to you. Please let me know if this works for you, and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is higher than your maximum budget of $150. While it's tempting to get the ""special offer,"" you can save money by seeing what other options are available. Rejecting this offer opens the door to potentially negotiating a better price with Alice or buying from John at your maximum budget."
