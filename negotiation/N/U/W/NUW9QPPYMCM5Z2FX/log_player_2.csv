Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $60 is far below what I can accept. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $100.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is a significant compromise.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm and her final offer of $90 is still above your maximum budget. While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee she'll come down further. It's better to secure the product from John for $80, guaranteeing you stay within budget."
