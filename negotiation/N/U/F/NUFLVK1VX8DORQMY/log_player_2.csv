"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is below her perceived value, it's significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. You have a strong alternative with John, so you should try to negotiate a better price with Alice or go with John."
