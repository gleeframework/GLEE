"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so there's a safety net in case Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering with $1,300,000. This is still above Bob's perceived value but closer to my minimum value.  I'm hoping to find a compromise point that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more.  I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price and don't want to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to sell for $1,200,000, but I'm not going to go any lower. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in my product and accept this offer. If he doesn't, I can always sell to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still too low, and we're running out of time. It's becoming increasingly unlikely that Bob will come up to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, so that's the best course of action at this point."
