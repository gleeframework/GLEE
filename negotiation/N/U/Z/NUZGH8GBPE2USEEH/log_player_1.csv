Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will result in a price closer to my target. Selling to John ensures I receive the full value I place on the product."
