"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You value the product at $150 and Alice is willing to sell it for $140. While this is a good deal, you can potentially get a better price by negotiating further. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is better than John's price of $150, but I want to try and save as much as possible. Offering $130 is a reasonable counteroffer, as it's still higher than Alice's value of $120 and gives her some room to negotiate. This will allow us to hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price closer to my target of $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $135 is a good deal. It's lower than John's price of $150 and only slightly higher than my counteroffer of $130.  While I'd prefer to pay even less, it's likely Alice won't budge further, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money and secure the product."
