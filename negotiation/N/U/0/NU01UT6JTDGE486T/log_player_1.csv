Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's not too high:**  If Bob is truly interested, he'll likely be willing to negotiate down from this price.

However, it's important to consider that this is just a starting point.  You can adjust your offer based on:

* **Your understanding of Bob's financial situation:** If you believe he's able to pay a higher price, you may want to adjust the offer accordingly.
* **The urgency of the sale:**  If you need to sell the product quickly, you may be more willing to accept a lower offer.
* **The market value of the product:**  Researching similar products can help you determine a fair price. 

Ultimately, the best offer is the one that maximizes your profits while still appealing to Bob."
