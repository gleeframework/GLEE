Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value proposition of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open. By starting with a price close to my desired outcome, I put pressure on Bob to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable offer.  

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I can adjust my strategy:

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully achieved a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll assess his counteroffer and either accept it (if it's close to my desired price) or make a counteroffer of my own.
* **If negotiation stalls:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000 to ensure I get a minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price of $9,500. While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Therefore, rejecting his offer and continuing negotiations is the best option at this point.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal my willingness to negotiate further. This also allows me to potentially reach a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices. My counteroffer will be higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which I believe is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $9,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,500. 
* **Message:** I express my appreciation for Bob's interest and reiterate that his initial offer is too low. I frame my counteroffer as a fair price for both of us, encouraging Bob to consider it. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Signal flexibility:**  It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain a favorable price:** It's still above Bob's perceived value and closer to my desired outcome.
* **Encourage agreement:**  By presenting the offer as ""fair,"" I increase the chances of Bob accepting.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully assess Bob's response to my counteroffer and decide whether to accept his counteroffer (if it's close to my desired price) or make another counteroffer. I can also choose to sell to John at any time for $10,000 if negotiations become too protracted or unfavorable."
