"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting at $1,200,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000. How about $1,050,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do even better. How about $975,000? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for me considering the value of this product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 still doesn't quite work for me. It's a great product, and it's worth a lot to both of us. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm not willing to go all the way up to $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",950000.0,Bob,6,
