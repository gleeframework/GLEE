"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $90. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles here.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, but $75 is still not quite enough for me. How about we settle on $80?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for the product. What do you say?",80.0,Alice,5,
