Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's also within my budget. What do you think?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, however, $9,500 is cutting it a bit close to my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value."", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
