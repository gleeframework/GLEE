"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's also within my budget. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, however, $9,500 is cutting it a bit close to my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
