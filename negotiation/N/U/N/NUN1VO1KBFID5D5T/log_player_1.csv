Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point. I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,150,000.  This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation and ensures I'm not immediately cutting off the deal.

I'm considering a few factors:

* **Bob's Value:** I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so I'm offering him a price that's closer to his value than my minimum. 
* **Negotiation Space:** This offer leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer and for me to counter back if needed.
* **John's Offer:**  While I'm open to negotiating with Bob, I'm also aware that John is willing to pay my minimum. This provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

By starting with a reasonable offer, I aim to encourage a successful negotiation while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and leaves me with less profit than selling to John.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm counter-offering Bob with a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between my initial offer and his last offer. I'm aiming to:

* **Show Flexibility:** Demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Stay Above Minimum:** This price is still higher than Bob's initial value and above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't undervalue the product.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  This allows for further negotiation rounds if necessary.

I believe this counteroffer is a fair proposition, and I hope Bob will accept it. If he rejects it, I'll need to reassess the situation and consider if continuing the negotiation is worthwhile or if it's better to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  

Negotiating further with Bob risks a continued stalemate, and John's offer guarantees me the maximum profit. 

It's important to remember that my goal is to maximize my earnings, and John's offer allows me to achieve that. While I might have been able to squeeze out a few more dollars from Bob, the time and energy required for further negotiation might not be worth the potential gains."
