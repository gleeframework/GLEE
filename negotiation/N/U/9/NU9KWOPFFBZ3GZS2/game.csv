I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the value this product will bring to your business in the long run.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  While I see the value in this product, I'm firm on my budget of $800,000. Let's find a compromise closer to that figure.",800000.0,Bob,4,

I believe this represents a fair price considering the value I'm seeking and the limited time we have left.",800000.0,Bob,6,
