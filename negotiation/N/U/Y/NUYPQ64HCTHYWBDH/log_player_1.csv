Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for potential compromise. This strategy allows for a possible counteroffer from Bob, giving you a chance to either accept his offer or make another counteroffer, ultimately leading to a potentially higher sale price. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to evaluate his counteroffer and strategize accordingly, always keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for further negotiation. I'm hoping this shows Bob my willingness to come down in price while still ensuring a profitable sale for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value. Rather than continue the negotiation, I'm going to take the sure thing and sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This ensures I meet my minimum financial goal and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might not result in a better outcome."
