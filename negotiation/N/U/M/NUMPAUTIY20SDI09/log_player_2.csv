"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500.  I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is $11,500, which is less than your $12,000 maximum. While you could reject hoping for a lower price, there's a risk Alice won't go lower and you'd have to pay John more. Accepting saves you $500."
