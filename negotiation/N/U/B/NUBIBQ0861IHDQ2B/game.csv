"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I need to make a profit on this product, and $900,000 doesn't quite cut it. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? It's a good compromise that allows you to get a great deal while also ensuring I can cover my costs.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000?  It's a fair price for both parties, and it keeps the deal on track.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $925,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 is simply too far off from what this product is worth. If you're serious about getting it, we need to get closer to the $975,000 mark. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $950,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward. ",950000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $920,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not comfortable going above that.",920000.0,Bob,8,
