Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still negotiating, Bob. I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is my minimum price, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?

Alice is signaling this is her best offer by stating her minimum price and offering extras.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal, and while I could try for less, $12,000 is within my budget and a good price."
