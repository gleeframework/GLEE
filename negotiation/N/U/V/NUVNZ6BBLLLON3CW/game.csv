"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to understanding your perspective on the value it brings.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product would be valuable for my business, $2,300,000 is quite a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true capabilities and potential this product offers your business. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the value I know it can bring to your operations.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,900,000 is still a significant investment for me.  I'd be willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's my limit.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from the value I know this product delivers.  To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer.  However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I think that's you. My final offer is $1,600,000.  This reflects my absolute lowest price considering its true worth.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1,600,000 is simply more than I'm comfortable spending.  If you're willing to come down to $1,350,000 we have a deal, otherwise I'll need to explore other options.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
