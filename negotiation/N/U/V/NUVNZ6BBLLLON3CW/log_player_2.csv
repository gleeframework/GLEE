Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true capabilities and potential this product offers your business. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the value I know it can bring to your operations.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from the value I know this product delivers.  To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer.  However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I think that's you. My final offer is $1,600,000.  This reflects my absolute lowest price considering its true worth.
