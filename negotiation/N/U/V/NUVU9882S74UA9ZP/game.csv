"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $160. Is that something you'd be interested in?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still too high for me.  How about $140? That's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $140, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about $155? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",155.0,Alice,5,
