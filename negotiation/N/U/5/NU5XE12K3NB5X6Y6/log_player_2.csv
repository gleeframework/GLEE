"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is still a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. How about $1,100,000? This still leaves room for you to gain significant value from the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject another counteroffer and Bob might end up paying the full price from John.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation."
