"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but you can potentially do better.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $800,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a lower price.**  By rejecting, you open the possibility of Alice lowering her price or for you to make a counteroffer that she might accept.

**Next steps:**  You should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price of $900,000, but it's still a reasonable starting point, considering your maximum price of $1,200,000 and her minimum of $800,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves room for both of you to negotiate further, depending on how strongly Alice wants to sell the product.

**Next steps:** Now you'll need to see if Alice accepts your offer or makes a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is closer to your initial maximum, but still not ideal.**  While it's better than her first offer, it's still above your target price. 
* **You still have room for negotiation.** You can likely find a middle ground that's more favorable for you. 

**Next steps:**  You should send another counteroffer to Alice, potentially somewhere in the middle between $850,000 and $925,000. Aim for a price that's closer to your preferred range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a middle ground between your previous offer of $850,000 and Alice's latest offer of $925,000. It shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to your target.
* **Staying within your budget:**  This price is still within your budget of $1,200,000, leaving you with some wiggle room.

**Next steps:**  You'll need to wait for Alice's response.  She might accept your offer, counter with a new price, or even decide to sell the product to someone else."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is the best she has made so far.** It's still higher than you'd like, but it's closer to your target price than her previous offers.
* **You're getting a good deal.**  You're saving $300,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice changing her mind or even rejecting your future offers completely.

**Next steps:** Accept the offer and purchase the product. You've achieved a good price while ensuring you acquire the product within your budget."
