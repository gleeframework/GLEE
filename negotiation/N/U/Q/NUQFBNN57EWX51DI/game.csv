"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $9,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? I'm confident this is still a good deal for you, given the value you place on the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500, which would be $9,250. Can we compromise on that price?",9250.0,Bob,4,
