"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is halfway between my minimum value ($8,000) and the maximum value Bob is willing to pay ($12,000). This gives me a good starting point for negotiation while leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than my minimum, I want to try and get closer to my target price of $10,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $9,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? I'm confident this is still a good deal for you, given the value you place on the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500, which would be $9,250. Can we compromise on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my target of $10,000, $9,250 is a good compromise. I'm only $250 away from my target, and Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate.  It's better than selling to John for $8,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
