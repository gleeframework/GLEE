Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), but it's still high enough to leave room for negotiation and potential profit. It also gives Bob a good reason to consider the offer, as it's still below his perceived value of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000. It's the maximum I can afford at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I could sell to him for $12,000, I'm not willing to accept such a low price when I have another buyer willing to pay $15,000. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately I can't accept $12,000. My minimum price is $13,500. I'm confident this price is still fair considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
