"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000. It's the maximum I can afford at this time."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately I can't accept $12,000. My minimum price is $13,500. I'm confident this price is still fair considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $12,000.  Alice's minimum price is $13,500, which is still more than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's better to get the product at his target price from John than to continue negotiating with Alice."
