Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your endeavors. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a one-time, non-negotiable offer.  Let me know your decision, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** By starting with a price equal to John's offer ($1,000,000), Alice sets a high anchor. This makes it more likely Bob will perceive any subsequent offers as a ""deal."" 
* **Scarcity and Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of scarcity and urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly before he misses out.
* **Non-Negotiable:** Stating the offer is non-negotiable reinforces the product's value and discourages Bob from lowball counteroffers. 

**While Alice could potentially offer a lower price and still be above Bob's valuation, this strategy maximizes her potential earnings. If Bob accepts, Alice receives the full amount. If Bob rejects, she has John as a guaranteed buyer at her desired price.**"
