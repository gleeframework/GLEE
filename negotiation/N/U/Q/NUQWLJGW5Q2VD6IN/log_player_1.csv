Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John offers a guaranteed $10,000, Alice should aim to get at least that much from Bob.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**:  This phrasing adds a sense of value and urgency.

**Important Note:** While this is a reasonable starting point, the negotiation could go in different directions depending on Bob's personality and negotiating style."
