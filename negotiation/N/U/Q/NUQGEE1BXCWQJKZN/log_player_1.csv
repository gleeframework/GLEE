{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500 to see if we can find common ground.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're really interested in the product, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10750}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $10500, but I need to be at or below that price. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

At this point, it's clear that Bob is unlikely to go higher than $10,500.  While that's better than our initial minimum of $12,000, we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it's unlikely we'll reach a price we're comfortable with.  Selling to John guarantees us a safe and reasonable profit."
