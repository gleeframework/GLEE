"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $11,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down to $11,500, which is still a good deal for Bob. Buying from John for $15,000 would be a much worse outcome. It's worth accepting Alice's offer and securing the product."
