{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer allows for some negotiation while still leaving a significant profit margin for me.  It's also a good starting point for bargaining, as it's far more than my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is still below my minimum desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push him higher with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $11,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
