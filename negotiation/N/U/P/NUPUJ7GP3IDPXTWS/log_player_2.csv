"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  $22,000 is way beyond your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is aggressive but necessary to start the negotiation.  You're immediately showing Alice that you're serious about getting a good price and that you're willing to walk away if needed.  It's also within your budget, so you have room to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. $10,000 is quite a bit below my bottom line.  To be fair, I could come down to $19,000.  This product has a lot of hidden value that you'll discover once you start using it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $19,000 is still too high. While it's a step in the right direction, it's still above your budget. You need to continue negotiating to try and get a lower price.  You're still willing to negotiate, but you're getting closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $19,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  I think this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm expecting to get from the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to push Alice towards your price point. You're showing you're serious about the deal but also leaving room for compromise.  The offer is still within your budget, allowing you to potentially increase it slightly if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but there's still a pretty big gap between our positions. Let's try to find a middle ground - would you consider $16,500?  I'm really trying to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,500 is still too high.  You're getting closer, but you're determined to save as much money as possible. You're willing to keep negotiating, but you're also getting closer to John's offer.  You need to find a way to push Alice down to a more acceptable price without going above your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  However, $16,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  Let's find a way to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing that you're willing to compromise but still holding firm to your budget.  You're inching closer to Alice's price, creating a scenario where a deal might be reached soon.  This also keeps you from being too close to John's offer, giving you leverage."
