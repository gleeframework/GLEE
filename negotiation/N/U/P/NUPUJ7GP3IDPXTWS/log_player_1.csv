Round 2
Bob's offer:

{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. $10,000 is quite a bit below my bottom line.  To be fair, I could come down to $19,000.  This product has a lot of hidden value that you'll discover once you start using it."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  However, $16,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  Let's find a way to make this deal happen.

```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting Bob's current offer of $13,000 would mean losing out on $2,000 that John is guaranteed to pay.  At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward."
