Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get him to meet me halfway. This allows for negotiation and leaves room to adjust my offer if needed.  I am also aware that I can always go with John's offer of $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's better than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show a willingness to negotiate but still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While he's slightly raised his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John, it's better to sell to him and avoid further negotiations with Bob."
