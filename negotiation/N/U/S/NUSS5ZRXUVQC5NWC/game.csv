"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work!",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $115 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $111.25. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",111.25,Alice,5,
