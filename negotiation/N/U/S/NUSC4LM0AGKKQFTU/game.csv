"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. It's the most I can afford, and I'm sure it's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $85. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $100. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",100.0,Alice,5,
