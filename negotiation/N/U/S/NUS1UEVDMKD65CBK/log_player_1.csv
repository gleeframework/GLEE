"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows for room to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Friendly approach:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming for higher profit:** While $130 is better than Bob's initial perceived value of $120, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation space:** I believe there is still room for negotiation, especially since Bob has shown interest in the product.  
* **Potential for higher counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, potentially leading to a better deal for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $135? It's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by decreasing my price, but it's still higher than Bob's offer.
* **Staying above minimum:** $135 is above my minimum acceptable price ($150), ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to see the worth of my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $130 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $132.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm:** While $132.50 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, suggesting he values the product. I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  I'm hoping a counteroffer from me might convince Bob to meet me at my desired price point or at least get closer to it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $132.50 is still a little too low. I'm happy to meet you in the middle, how about $134? It's a fair price for a product of this quality. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 134} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm offering a small compromise by lowering my price from $135 to $134. This shows flexibility without significantly impacting my profit.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I continue to frame the offer as fair and reasonable, emphasizing the product's quality.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm using a more assertive tone, urging Bob to close the deal and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $133, but no higher. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $133. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $133
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob's offer of $133 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. 
* **Time Factor:**  We've already gone through 6 rounds of negotiation, and there's a good chance we'll be stuck in a stalemate. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a guaranteed $150, which is significantly more profitable and eliminates the risk of further negotiation. 

By selling to John, I secure a much better profit and avoid the potential of a long and tedious negotiation with Bob that might not lead to a better outcome."
