"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $11,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and more than what I could get from another buyer. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can get a better deal by rejecting her offer. You know John is willing to sell the product for $12,000, so there's a chance Alice might lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
