{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $130 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
This offer starts with a friendly message, highlighting the value of the product to Bob. The price of $130 is significantly lower than my minimum of $150 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good deal and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I believe I can get a better price from Bob or John.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

While $110 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer one more time before considering selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer:

Bob is unwilling to budge from $110, and at this point, I'm getting tired of the back-and-forth. I'm going to sell to John for $150.  It's a better price than what Bob is offering, and I'm not going to waste any more time trying to get him to agree to something more."
