"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is the absolute lowest I can go.  Let's meet in the middle.  This price still provides a great value for you while ensuring I don't lose too much.",10500.0,Alice,3,
