Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $200 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value but $180 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $90? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

Bob is very unlikely to go above his stated maximum price.  It's time to cut bait and take the guaranteed $150 from John."
