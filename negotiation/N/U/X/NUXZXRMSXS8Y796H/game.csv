"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential. I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000. This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
