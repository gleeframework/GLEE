"I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for you, but $7,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $8,200. I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $8,000, Bob. How about we try to get closer to my minimum price with a compromise at $8,300? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good deal.",8300.0,Alice,5,
