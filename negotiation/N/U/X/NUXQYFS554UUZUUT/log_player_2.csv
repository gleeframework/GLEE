Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for you, but $7,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $8,200. I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $8,000, Bob. How about we try to get closer to my minimum price with a compromise at $8,300? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,300

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,000.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation rounds. Buying from John guarantees the product at your target price."
