Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good deal for you. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000, and still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. It's worth accepting this offer and avoiding further negotiation."
