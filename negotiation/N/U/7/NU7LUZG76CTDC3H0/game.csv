"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit high for me at this moment.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me while still allowing you a good profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
