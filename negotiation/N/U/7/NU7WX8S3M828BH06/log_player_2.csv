# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get it to you, but I still need to make a profit. What do you think?
