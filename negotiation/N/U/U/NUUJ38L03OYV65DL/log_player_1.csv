Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This is a strong starting offer. It's significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. It's also higher than John's offer, ensuring you're getting a better deal than selling to him. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A high starting offer gives you more room to negotiate down.
* **Encourage Bob to negotiate:** A gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value encourages him to make a counteroffer.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Having John as a backup option keeps you from being pressured into accepting too low an offer.
