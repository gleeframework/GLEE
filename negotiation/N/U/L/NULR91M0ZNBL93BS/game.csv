,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but  $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? ",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with a price of $135. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $135 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's try $130.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go back to my original offer of $130. I'll counter with a price of $132.50. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for the product.",132.5,Alice,5,
