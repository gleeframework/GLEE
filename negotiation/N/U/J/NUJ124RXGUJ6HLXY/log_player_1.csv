Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum threshold, leaving room for negotiation.  It also signals you're serious about selling, but you value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than your minimum target.  Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer allows you to try and push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, to $900,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $875000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $875,000 is closer to your target, it's still a significant amount of money left on the table. Continue negotiating with Bob to see if you can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your desire to get the best deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $875,000 still isn't quite there for me. Let's try $890,000. This is a fair compromise that keeps the deal beneficial for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 890000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $880000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $880,000 is now within your target range. You have reached a point where further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome, and you risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice to ensure a successful sale."
