"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product,  $1,500,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This represents a significant discount and offers a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This price is more in line with my budget and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
