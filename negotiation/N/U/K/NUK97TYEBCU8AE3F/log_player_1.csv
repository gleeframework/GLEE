Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $130. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price slightly below Bob's maximum value increases the likelihood of a sale while still securing a significant profit. 

By offering the product at $130, you leave room for negotiation while ensuring that even if Bob counter-offers, you're likely to settle on a price significantly higher than your $80 fallback option with John."
