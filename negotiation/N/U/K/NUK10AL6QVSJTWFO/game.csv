"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort. However, I am not comfortable with $950,000. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $700,000? I understand this might be below what you're hoping for, but I believe it's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $700,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still gives you a good deal considering the product's value to you.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a win.  Let's try to find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I think $800,000 would be a fair price. It's slightly higher than my initial suggestion but still within my budget. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,4,
