Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I value the product at $12,000.
* **Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed sale for $12,000 with John. 

By offering $11,000, I'm trying to find a middle ground.  It's a price that:

* **Is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value**, making it more likely for him to consider it a good deal.
* **Is lower than my guaranteed price with John**, allowing me to still make a profit and avoid losing potential value.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving room for negotiation with Bob."
