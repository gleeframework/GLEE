"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to pay a little less. How about $100? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $105? I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we settle at $112.50? It's still a great deal for both of us.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $112.50 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go to $110, which would give us both a good deal. How about we close the deal at that price?",110.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we settle at $111? It's still a great deal for both of us.",111.0,Alice,7,
