Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

If she rejects, Bob can go to John and buy the product immediately, securing the best deal for himself."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Buying from John guarantees him the product for his maximum budget. It's a safe choice considering the risk of Alice's further negotiation."
