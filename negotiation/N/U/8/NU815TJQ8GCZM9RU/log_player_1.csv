""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Please let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Maximizing Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's valuation ($1,400,000) creates a strong incentive for Bob to accept. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to make a decision quickly, preventing him from delaying or lowballing."
