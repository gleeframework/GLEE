"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is generous, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's say $1,600,000, and we have a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position. Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair and equitable deal for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,550,000 is the right price. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to see some more movement. I'll propose $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
