"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to Alice's value of the product ($120).  Offering $125 leaves some room for negotiation but shows a genuine interest in buying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we split the difference and agree on $132.5? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While $132.5 is still more than Bob wants to pay, it's a good compromise.  Accepting the offer saves Bob money compared to buying from John, and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds potentially leading to a higher price."
