"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is still too high.  While it's better than John's price, there's room for negotiation to try and get a better deal.  There are 9 rounds left, so rejecting and counter-offering is a good strategy to explore if a better price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay less. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential savings for you."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter-Offer:** I'm starting with a significant counter-offer, hoping to push Alice towards a lower price. 
* **Justification:** I'm highlighting the potential savings for Alice, while still acknowledging the product's value to me. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for further negotiation in the upcoming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still higher than what I'm aiming for. There are still 7 rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a better price.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $850,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is a fair price given the product's value to both of us. Let's close this deal and save each other time and effort."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** My counter-offer is closer to Alice's previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Fair Price Argument:** I'm reiterating the value to both of us, aiming to create a sense of urgency and a win-win scenario.
* **Closing Emphasis:** I'm using language like ""close this deal"" to subtly increase pressure and encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still above my target. 
* **Negotiation Advantage:** We're still in the early stages of the negotiation, and I have several rounds left to push for a better deal.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe there's a good chance Alice will lower her price further, especially if I maintain a firm stance."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $810,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering your value and the savings I'm offering. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 810000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm offering a small increase from my previous counter-offer, showing I'm willing to meet halfway.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm reiterating the fair price argument, highlighting the benefit to both parties.
* **Closing Tone:** I'm using language like ""finalize this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $825,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $815,000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $815,000 is very close to my target price of $800,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're down to the last three rounds.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk Alice might walk away or become less flexible, potentially pushing me to buy from John at a much higher price. 
* **Acceptable Compromise:** While not my ideal price, it's still a good deal compared to John's offer."
