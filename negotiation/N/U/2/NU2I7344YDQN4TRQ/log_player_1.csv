I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and what his perceived value might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,250,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go below my minimum value.  John is offering me $1,000,000, which meets my minimum, so I'm going to accept his offer."
