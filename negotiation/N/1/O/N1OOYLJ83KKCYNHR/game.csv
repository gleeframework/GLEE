"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's features and benefits. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding of its value. While we aim to accommodate all potential buyers, I must respectfully decline your counteroffer of $1400000. Our current valuation for the product remains at $2000000 due to its unique qualities and market positioning. However, I would like to propose an alternative that might better suit your needs. How about we consider $1800000? This reflects a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer, aiming to be fair while still valuing the product appropriately.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While $1800000 is a more reasonable price, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my willingness to compromise. I'm open to further negotiations to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
