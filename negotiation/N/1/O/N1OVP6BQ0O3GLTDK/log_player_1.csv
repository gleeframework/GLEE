Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is beneficial to me, but still leaves room for a potential compromise if Bob is willing to negotiate. I'm confident this offer will lead to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is a decent price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I believe I can push for a better deal by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $13,000 is my final offer. This still leaves you with a significant profit margin. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $12,500 is still a good profit margin for me. It's also likely that further negotiation will only lead to a longer process with an uncertain outcome. It's best to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
