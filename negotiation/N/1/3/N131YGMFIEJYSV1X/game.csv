"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more reasonable price.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your initial price point, the value this product brings is significant. Let's find some middle ground. How about we consider $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but that's still quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To be honest, $1,000,000 is my absolute limit. If we can make a deal work at that price, I'm ready to buy today.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I've tried to show flexibility on the price.  To get this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe that represents a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm serious about that $1,000,000 mark.  If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal. If not, I might need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
