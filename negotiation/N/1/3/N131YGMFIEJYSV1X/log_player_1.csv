"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm offering it to you for $2,250,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum. This allows room for negotiation and creates the perception that the product is highly valuable.
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, we ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's worth. Even if this initial offer is rejected, it sets a high reference point for future negotiations.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give us valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more reasonable price.  Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value. Accepting would be a substantial loss. We need to guide him towards a more reasonable price point. We'll counter with an offer closer to his perceived value while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your initial price point, the value this product brings is significant. Let's find some middle ground. How about we consider $1,700,000?"",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a substantial decrease from our initial price, signaling to Bob that we're willing to negotiate. 
* **Above Bob's Value, Below Ours:** This counter-offer is strategically positioned above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still below our minimum ($1,500,000). This keeps the negotiation active and aims to draw Bob closer to our target.
* **Maintaining Value:** We don't want to drop the price too drastically too soon, as this could undervalue the product in Bob's eyes.  We're aiming for a gradual descent towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but that's still quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To be honest, $1,000,000 is my absolute limit. If we can make a deal work at that price, I'm ready to buy today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has now revealed his perceived value, accepting his offer would still leave a significant amount of money on the table. We know we have a guaranteed offer from John, but it's still early in the negotiation with Bob. We'll make another strategic counteroffer to test his resolve and potentially bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I've tried to show flexibility on the price.  To get this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe that represents a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Signaling:** We're making it clear that this is a significant concession and close to our final offer. 
* **Above Bob's Limit, Below John's:** This price is still above Bob's stated limit but considerably closer. It puts pressure on him to make a move while staying below our guaranteed offer from John.
* **Seeking Closure:** By Round 5, we're nearing the halfway point. This offer aims to gauge Bob's true willingness to negotiate and potentially close the deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm serious about that $1,000,000 mark.  If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal. If not, I might need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's clear Bob is anchored to his $1,000,000 valuation.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we can bridge the gap of $400,000 within the remaining rounds.  Bob's statement about exploring other options suggests he might be using stalling tactics.  We have a guaranteed offer from John at our desired minimum price. It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and solidify the sale with John."
