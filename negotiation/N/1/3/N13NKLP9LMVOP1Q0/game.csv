"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the gesture, but $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $10,500 yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
