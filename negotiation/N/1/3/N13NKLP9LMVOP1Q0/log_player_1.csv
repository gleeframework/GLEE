Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the gesture, but $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
