``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This allows for negotiation while still leaving room for me to make a profit.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if I should sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the quick sale, I'm confident I can do better.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is a good price point, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $8,200. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal, it's still below my minimum.  I'm not desperate for a quick sale and believe I can push for a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to find a compromise without sacrificing too much."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,200 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to go down to $8,600.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8600}
