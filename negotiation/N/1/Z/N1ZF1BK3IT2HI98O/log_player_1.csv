Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth at least $100. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is slightly below your minimum price point but still leaves some room for negotiation, as it's higher than the product's value to Bob. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize your potential earnings:** By starting high, you increase your chances of getting a higher price. 
* **Maintain the possibility of selling to John:** You haven't reached your minimum yet, so you can still choose to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out. 
* **Start the negotiation on a positive note:**  A friendly tone can encourage Bob to consider your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is a better offer than Bob's initial assessment, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $100.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter-propose and potentially reach a price closer to your desired amount.  

You're also aware that you can always sell to John for $100, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your minimum price and Bob's offer. It shows willingness to negotiate while still staying above your minimum.  The message also highlights the ""fairness"" of the price, which could be a persuasive tactic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'd be willing to pay $87 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer, $87 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $100.  You've already engaged in multiple rounds of negotiation, and it seems that Bob is not willing to go much higher.

Given that you have a guaranteed sale to John for $100, it's in your best interest to accept that offer and avoid further negotiation with Bob. This decision ensures that you achieve your minimum price and avoid the risk of further concessions."
