"Bob, I understand you're looking to save, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,4,
