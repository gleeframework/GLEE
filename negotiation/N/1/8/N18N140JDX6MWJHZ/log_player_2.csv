"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than John's price of $1,200,000, it's still a significant markup from Alice's valuation of $800,000.  By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. This might prompt her to lower her price in a counter-offer. Even if she doesn't, you still have the option to buy from John at your maximum budget."
