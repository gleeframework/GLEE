Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm hoping to secure it closer to $750,000. This would still be a fair price for both of us, as it allows me to gain a valuable asset while ensuring you profit from the sale. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.
