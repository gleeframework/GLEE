"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the value it brings to your business.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm hoping to secure it closer to $750,000. This would still be a fair price for both of us, as it allows me to gain a valuable asset while ensuring you profit from the sale. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $750,000. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $825,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to your business and the profit I'll make from the sale. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my financial limitations. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us. Let's try $800,000. This price would allow me to proceed with the purchase while ensuring you receive a reasonable return on your investment.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the previous round, and I'm not willing to give up more value. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer you a price of $845,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this point.",845000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $845,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to close this deal at a slightly lower price.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I'm offering $820,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can come to a final agreement at this point.",820000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $840,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give up more value. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer you a price of $835,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this point.",835000.0,Alice,7,
