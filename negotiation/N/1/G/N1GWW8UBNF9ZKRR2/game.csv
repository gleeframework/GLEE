"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $135 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $135 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $145.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's make a deal.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $145 isn't quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $147.50?  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.",147.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $147.50 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $146.25?  This is a fair price, and we can both walk away happy.",146.25,Bob,6,
