Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1100000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is a fair price considering I'm sure you can find another buyer, and it gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
