"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'll sell it to you for $1100000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1100000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is a fair price considering I'm sure you can find another buyer, and it gives us both a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $950000. Considering the product's value to you is $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1050000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the value you place on it, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
