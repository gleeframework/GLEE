"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm confident you'll see the value in making a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I can't go higher than $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product and willing to pay a fair price, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I'm looking for. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both be comfortable with.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm very serious about buying this product, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  How about we split the difference at $950,000? This would give you a decent profit while still staying within my financial limits.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm looking for. Considering the value of the product and the effort I've invested, I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000 again. I'm willing to give you a slight discount to $1,020,000, which is still a great deal for you. I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
