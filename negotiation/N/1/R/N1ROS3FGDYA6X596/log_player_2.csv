It's always best to try and negotiate a better price.  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but we can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we can likely get closer to our goal of $900,000.  Let's see if we can get her to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $925,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm still looking for a good deal."
