Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up, getting you closer to your ideal price.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties adds a time pressure that might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

**Why this strategy is better than offering $1,200,000 or slightly less:**

* **$1,200,000 or less:**  This leaves no room for negotiation and you immediately settle for the minimum you're willing to accept. Bob has no incentive to negotiate and you miss out on potential profit. 
* **Much higher than $1,150,000:** This is likely to scare Bob away without any chance for negotiation."
