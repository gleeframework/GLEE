"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for less from Alice or from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm happy to sell for $11,000, which is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. It's a better deal than buying from John, and he's already saved $500 from Alice's initial offer.  Further negotiation might save him another $500, but it's not worth the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and forcing him to buy from John at a higher price."
