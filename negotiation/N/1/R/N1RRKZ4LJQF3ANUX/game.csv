"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could you do $7,500? That would work much better for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $8,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm hoping we can find common ground.",8000.0,Alice,5,
