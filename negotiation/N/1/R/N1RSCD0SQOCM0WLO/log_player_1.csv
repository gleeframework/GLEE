Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a significant profit. I'm also aware that Bob's perceived value of the product is unknown, so I'm leaving room for negotiation. 

I'll keep an eye on how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he counters, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or offer a counter-counteroffer.  

I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option, ensuring I don't get stuck in a protracted negotiation with Bob if his offers fall below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but it's still below my initial target.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a better price. I believe there's still room for improvement, and I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly from my initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise. However, I'm still aiming for a profit and trying to find a middle ground between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  I believe this counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a successful negotiation.  I'm hopeful that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at $1,600,000, which is significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. While I would still prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer is a good compromise. It ensures a profitable deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially resulting in a lower price or a stalemate."
