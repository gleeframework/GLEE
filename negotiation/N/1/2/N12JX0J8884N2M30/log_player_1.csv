"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to close a deal, I can't accept such a drastic reduction from my initial offer.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum. It shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not desperate to sell at a major loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not a good enough price. I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob in hopes of finding a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000. This is a compromise that shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but I'm still holding firm to a price that's fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. While I could keep negotiating, there's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a higher price. I've only got 4 rounds left and it's getting riskier to keep rejecting. It's best to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale at $1,400,000."
