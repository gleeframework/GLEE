Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go below $100. I can offer you a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $99. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $99.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation and risking getting stuck with a higher price when you can buy from John for $100."
