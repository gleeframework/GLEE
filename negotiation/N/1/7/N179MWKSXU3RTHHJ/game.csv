"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm hoping to get for this product. Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we try $12,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"You're right, $12,000 isn't too far off from what I'd consider.  How about we settle at $14,500? That's my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. If you're willing to go as low as $13,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.",13000.0,Bob,6,
