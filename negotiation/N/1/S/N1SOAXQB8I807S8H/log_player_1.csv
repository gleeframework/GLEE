Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  The minimum you'll accept is $1,500,000 (John's guaranteed offer).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to him.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range can potentially benefit both parties.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA, but you don't know how much Bob is willing to pay above his perceived value.  Here's a strategy that balances ambition with a reasonable chance of success:

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting near the top of the ZOPA, maximizing your potential gain.
* **Confidence:** The message implies the product is in high demand, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Justification:** While not revealing your bottom line, you vaguely mention ""unique value"" to anchor the price in Bob's mind.
* **Time Pressure:** The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not dwell too long on the price.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before you walk away to John's offer.
* **Building Rapport:** While this response focuses on the offer itself, in a real negotiation, establishing a positive relationship with Bob could be beneficial."
