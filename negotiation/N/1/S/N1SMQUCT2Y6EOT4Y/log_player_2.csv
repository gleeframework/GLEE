"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,500,000 is above his budget, and he can potentially get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product and I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering your own value for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1300000. This is still a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget and he can potentially get a better deal by making another counteroffer. It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant amount for me.  Considering your stated value for the product, I believe this is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1200000 is a significant amount for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1280000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is no less than $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's final offer is still above Bob's desired price range and he knows he can get the product for a lower price from John. At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product at a lower price than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
