"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value and could significantly benefit you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable arrangement."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, subtly justifying the high initial price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative, expressing confidence in reaching a mutually beneficial deal. This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your valuation and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this would be a substantial loss. It's highly likely that a more favorable agreement can be reached through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential benefits.  To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This reflects my willingness to find a compromise while still recognizing the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** Coming down $200,000 from the initial offer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but not desperation. This keeps the price well above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. 
* **Reiterating Value:** The message again emphasizes the product's value, subtly anchoring it in Bob's mind as something worth a substantial sum.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** By positioning the counteroffer as a compromise, you encourage Bob to reciprocate with a similarly reasonable move upward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,400,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now above his own perceived value of $1,000,000. While it's still below your desired outcome, it represents a significant profit margin. 

Here's why accepting is the best strategy at this point:

* **Strong Position:** Bob has shown a willingness to move significantly from his initial offer, indicating serious interest.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or reaching an impasse. Accepting guarantees a substantial profit.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation for a potentially small gain isn't always the best strategy. Closing the deal now provides immediate returns."
