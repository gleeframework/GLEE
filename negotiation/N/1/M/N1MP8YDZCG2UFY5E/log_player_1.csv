"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $100. It's worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is above my minimum value of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:**  The message is friendly and sets the stage for a potential win-win. 
* **Value proposition:** I mention the product being worth more, highlighting its potential value to Bob.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground quickly, maximizing my potential profits while remaining open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think $90 would be a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my desired price range.  
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John for $80.
* **Time pressure:** I have limited rounds, and it's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing out.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit ($10 above my minimum) and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
