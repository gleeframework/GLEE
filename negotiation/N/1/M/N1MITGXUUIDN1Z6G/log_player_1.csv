Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is more than your minimum value of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, which gives him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's not overly aggressive:** A much higher offer might make Bob immediately reject, making negotiation difficult. 

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still above your minimum:** $13,000 is greater than your minimum value of $12,000. So, there's still potential for a good deal here.
* **There's room for improvement:**  You can likely get closer to your desired price of $14,000 by counter-offering. 
* **Selling to John is not the best option right now:**  You can potentially earn more by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next steps:** You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider a price slightly lower than $14,000, but still above your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to move forward quickly.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between your previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $13,000.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the benefits for both parties, suggesting a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Sense of urgency:**  The message encourages Bob to make a decision quickly, which could increase the chances of him accepting. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially finalize the deal."
