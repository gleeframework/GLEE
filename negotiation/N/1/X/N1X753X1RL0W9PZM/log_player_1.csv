Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my target price of $1,000,000.  This is the best possible outcome for me.  Since Bob's maximum is $800,000, it's highly likely he'll reject this offer. This sets the stage for counter-offers and negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than what I want. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering a price of $950,000, which is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. This should be attractive to Bob since it's a significant increase from his last offer, while still allowing me to make a considerable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to reach my initial target price of $1,000,000, Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly closer to that than his previous offers, and is still a significant profit for me.  Given that I have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000, I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
