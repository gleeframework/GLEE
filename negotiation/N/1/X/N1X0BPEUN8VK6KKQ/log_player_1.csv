"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to make Bob more inclined to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Difference:** While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still losing a significant amount compared to my perceived value and John's offer. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room to negotiate a better price. Bob has shown a willingness to come up from his initial value.
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, but I'm hoping to get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? This gives you a great price and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm highlighting how the price benefits both of us, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm ending with a question to keep the negotiation open and encourage further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** $9,200 is still significantly below my minimum value, and I'm not willing to take such a large loss.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be more strategic and focus on getting a price closer to my target. 
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum value, and I'm not yet convinced that I can get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9,200 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to find common ground. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:**  I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise further. 
* **Emphasize Compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a compromise to make it more appealing and emphasize the need for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Focus on Agreement:** I'm explicitly stating the goal of reaching an agreement to encourage Bob to take the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We are down to 4 rounds left. 
* **Value Gap:** $9,000 is still below my minimum value, and I'm not confident I can negotiate a higher price in the remaining rounds.
