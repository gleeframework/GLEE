"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? This gives you a great price and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,200?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $9,200 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to find common ground. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time.",9500.0,Alice,5,
