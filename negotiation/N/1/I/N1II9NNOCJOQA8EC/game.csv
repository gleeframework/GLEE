"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 undervalues the product's true potential. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from comfortable with $1,050,000. How about we meet at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
