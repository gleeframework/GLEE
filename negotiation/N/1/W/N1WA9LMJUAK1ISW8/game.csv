"I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product, though. How about $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  How about $15,000? ",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you at $15,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.",15500.0,Alice,5,
