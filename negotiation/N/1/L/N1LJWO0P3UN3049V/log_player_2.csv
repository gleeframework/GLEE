Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for. However, I need to make sure I get a fair return on my investment.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,350,000. This is a final offer, as I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000 if we can't reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

This is a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Savings:** You're still saving $150,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could make Alice walk away, forcing you to buy from John at the higher price. 

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and she has a strong alternative with John.  Accepting now secures the deal and your savings."
