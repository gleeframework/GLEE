"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $15,000. It's wise to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. It's a fair price considering the value and quality of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget than her initial offer, it's still more than you'd like to pay.  It's worth seeing if you can push for a price closer to $12,000 by making another counteroffer. There's still room for negotiation without having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Let's split the difference - I'll pay $11,250. I think this would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm not quite ready to accept $11250. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, which is still a great price for the product. It's a fair compromise that I think would work for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is very close to your last counteroffer of $11,250.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's likely to be incremental.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept the offer and secure the product for a price that is within your budget and is fair to both parties.  You've achieved a good price without having to resort to John's higher price."
