This offer starts the negotiation by providing a price that is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation while still setting a strong starting point."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is a bit too pricey for me at the moment. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's tempting to accept, it's important to remember that my minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss.  It's better to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of your product, but I have a budget in mind. I can do $700,000.  It's a fair offer considering my limit.

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my target. I need to keep pushing for a better price.  Selling to John at $1,200,000 is still the best option, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a slightly better deal with Bob."
