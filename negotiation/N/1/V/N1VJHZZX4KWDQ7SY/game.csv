"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe $1,050,000 is a more reasonable compromise. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  That seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
