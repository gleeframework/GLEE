Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my target price and still leaves a substantial gap between what I value the product at and what he's willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate further.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe $1,050,000 is a more reasonable compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  That seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
