"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product for you, Bob. I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, you're trying to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Alice you're serious about getting the product but you're also looking for a better price.  $105 is a reasonable starting point, as it's still within your budget and leaves some room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $108, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $108, which is only $8 more than my preferred price.  It's still within my budget and a reasonable compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or me running out of rounds.  Accepting the offer is the most practical choice at this point."
