Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product,  $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price, but it's getting closer. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,750 is still a bit higher than your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,800 is only $300 above my target price and I've already rejected her last offer.  It's likely that she won't come down any further.  I'm going to accept this offer and save $2,200."
