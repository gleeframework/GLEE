"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product,  $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,750 is still a bit higher than your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,5,
