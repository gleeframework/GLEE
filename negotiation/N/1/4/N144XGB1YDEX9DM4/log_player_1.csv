"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a significant price, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a substantial profit.  I believe this is a good starting point considering the product is worth $15,000 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $9,000. While it's closer to my minimum price of $8,000, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $10,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still allows me to make a decent profit. I believe this price is fair, considering the product is worth $15,000 to Bob."
