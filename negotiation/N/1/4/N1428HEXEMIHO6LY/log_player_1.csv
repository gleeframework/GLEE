Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it holds. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.  
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price to Bob. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone encourages Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer, allowing for a potential agreement above $1,000,000."
