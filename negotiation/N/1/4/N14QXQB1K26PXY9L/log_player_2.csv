"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $20,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's important to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable negotiation range.  This leaves room to negotiate upwards while signaling that her initial price is unrealistic.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This offer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. A very negative reaction might mean she's not willing to negotiate much. 
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you always have John's offer of $12,000 as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident it's worth a good deal more. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice came down, which is good, but $14,000 is still above your $12,000 maximum.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's room to negotiate further.  Alice seems willing to move on price, so it's worth seeing if she'll come closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair offer, considering the market and the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** You're increasing your offer to show Alice you're serious about purchasing but not going above your budget. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for your counteroffer (""considering the market and the value it brings"") can make it more persuasive.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** This offer aims to find a middle ground between your initial offer and Alice's latest offer, encouraging her to move closer to your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a bit more.  Would you be willing to do $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **At Your Limit:** Alice's offer of $12,000 matches your maximum budget and John's offer. 
* **No Need to Risk Further:** There's no guarantee you can get a better price from Alice, and you might risk losing the deal altogether by pushing further. 
* **Securing the Deal:** Accepting now ensures you get the product at the best price you've been able to negotiate."
