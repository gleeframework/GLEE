Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $20,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair offer, considering the market and the value it brings. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a bit more.  Would you be willing to do $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
