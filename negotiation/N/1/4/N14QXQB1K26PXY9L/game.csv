"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $20,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident it's worth a good deal more. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair offer, considering the market and the value it brings.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a bit more.  Would you be willing to do $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",12000.0,Alice,5,
