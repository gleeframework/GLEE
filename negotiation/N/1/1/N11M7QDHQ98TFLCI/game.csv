"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
