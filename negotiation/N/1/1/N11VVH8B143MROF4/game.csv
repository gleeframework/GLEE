,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is above my budget.  Given the product's value to you at $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This price is fair and allows for both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,100,000 is a strong offer, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the value this product will bring to your business.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $1,200,000 for the product. This price acknowledges the value you place on it while remaining within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
