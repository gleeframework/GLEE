"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I consider other offers. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique chance to acquire it at a significant discount compared to its true worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have John as a fallback option at $1,200,000.  There's room to negotiate with Alice and try to get a price closer to her $800,000 valuation."
