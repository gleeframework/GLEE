"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $12,000, but Alice's offer is already $9,000.  
* **Negotiation is worth trying.** You have 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting and counteroffering gives you a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your valuation.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a better price for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's better than her initial offer, $8,500 is still more than you are willing to pay at this point.
* **You have room for negotiation.** You have multiple rounds left, and Alice has already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you a chance to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's exactly what you value it at.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,200. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target.**  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is now offering it for $8,200. This is a significant savings for you.
* **The negotiation is getting close.** You have only 5 rounds left, and there's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price further.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price.
* **You're avoiding the ""John"" risk.**  Buying from John means paying $12,000, which is significantly more than Alice's current offer."
