"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  Even if you can't get the price down to your ideal, you might be able to get a better price than John's $10,000 offer."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above my budget of $10,000. However, I'm still willing to negotiate with Alice. I believe that I can get her to come down further, especially considering she's already reduced her price from $18,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $14,000 is closer but still a bit too high for me.  I'm really determined to make this work and I'm willing to pay $12,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value to you and my initial asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price significantly, $13,500 is still above my budget.  At this point, it's clear that further negotiation with Alice will be difficult and time-consuming. I can get the product from John for a price within my budget, making it the most efficient and financially sound choice."
