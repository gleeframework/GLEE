"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10000. I'm confident you'll love it!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited to $10000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $14000 is closer but still a bit too high for me.  I'm really determined to make this work and I'm willing to pay $12000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your desire to sell the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value to you and my initial asking price. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
