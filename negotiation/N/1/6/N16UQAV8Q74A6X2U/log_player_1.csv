Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. It's the best I can do at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly anchored at $12,000 and unwilling to budge. It's unlikely further negotiation will get us closer to a desirable price. It's time to cut our losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
