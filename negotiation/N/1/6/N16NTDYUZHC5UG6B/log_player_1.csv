Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Minimum:**  I need to get at least $800,000 for the product because that's what John is offering.
* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation:** Offering $1,000,000 is a fair compromise. It's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for potential negotiation, and it's still a good deal for Bob, leaving him with a potential profit of $200,000. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still giving Bob a strong incentive to accept the offer."
