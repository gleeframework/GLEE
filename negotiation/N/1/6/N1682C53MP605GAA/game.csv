"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,650,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, $1,550,000 is still beyond my budget. I am willing to increase my counteroffer to $1,500,000. This brings us closer to your original asking price while still respecting my financial limits. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
