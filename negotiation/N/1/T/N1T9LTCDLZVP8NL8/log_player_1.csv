Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $12,000, but I'm also willing to accept John's offer if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider selling it for $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $9,750? It's a fair price, and it would allow me to make a decent profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be appealing to Bob. It's a compromise from my previous offer, but it still allows me to make a profit. I'm also keeping my options open by considering John's offer if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Could you consider selling it for $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my target price of $12,000,  Bob's offer of $9,500 is only $500 away.  Given the risk of further negotiation, I think it's better to accept his offer and secure the deal."
