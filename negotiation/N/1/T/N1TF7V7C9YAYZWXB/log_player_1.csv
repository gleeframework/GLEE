"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer ($1,400,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). 
* **Leaving ""Surplus"" on the Table:**  While aiming high, it's important to offer a price that still benefits Bob. A $100,000 gain for Bob is a strong incentive to consider the offer seriously.
* **Setting the Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing mutual benefit and a collaborative approach to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I believe the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum ($1,200,000) and his own stated value ($1,500,000). Accepting would mean a substantial loss for you. While his offer is aggressive, it indicates he's highly interested. It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a substantial gain."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between the initial offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,100,000). This signals flexibility while still aiming for a strong profit margin.
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message reinforces the product's value, reminding Bob of its potential to generate a significant return (even at $1,300,000).
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:**  While compromising, the counteroffer stays comfortably above the backup offer from John ($1,200,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $1,220,000? It's a fair offer closer to your asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now above your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). While you could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, Bob is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and meet you closer to your desired range. Accepting this offer secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer in future rounds or the negotiation reaching an impasse."
