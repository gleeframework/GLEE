"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is a bit low for me. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let's see if we can close this deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit too high. How about $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference at $105. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $100, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",100.0,Bob,6,
