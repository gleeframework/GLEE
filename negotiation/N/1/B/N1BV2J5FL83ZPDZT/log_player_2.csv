"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $850,000?  This would still allow you to make a substantial profit, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a bit away from John's price.  It's worth pushing a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That's closer, but I'm aiming for something around $750,000.  Would that be workable for you?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to sell the product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to make this work, I'm confident we can find a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems like Alice is unlikely to budge much further. Her offer went up from $850,000 to $900,000, signaling she might be holding firm. It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 than risk further rounds with Alice and potentially end up with a worse deal."
