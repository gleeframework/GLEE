"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, but $12500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd like to see $13500. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  Let's see if we can make this work!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down from $14000, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $13000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
