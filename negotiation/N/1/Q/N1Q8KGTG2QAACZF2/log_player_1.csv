"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to encourage negotiation. It's high enough that I'm still making a profit, but low enough to make Bob feel like he can potentially get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $125.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is better than nothing, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price that's a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  How about we split the difference at $130?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price for the product.  However, $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $128,  but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my $150 target, Bob's offer is only $2 away from my minimum acceptable price. It's not worth risking further negotiation, especially since John is waiting in the wings to purchase the product for $150."
