"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in.  It's something you value at $120, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.  That leaves plenty of room for you to make a profit, and it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $100, while John wants $120.
* **You're still getting a good deal:** Even though you value the product at $120, you're getting it for $100, saving $20. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial choice."
