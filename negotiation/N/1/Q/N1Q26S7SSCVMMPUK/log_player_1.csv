"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a fair starting point, as it's above my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a bit more for the product, but if he doesn't, I can always go down in price or sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I'm going to reject it. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price. I'll try to push for a bit more in the next round, but if we can't agree, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500 for the product. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this is appealing enough for Bob to accept, but if he doesn't, I'm ready to negotiate further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,200 is only $200 less than my minimum value.  It's getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing to negotiate, especially since I can sell to John for $12,000. I'll accept this offer and close the deal."
