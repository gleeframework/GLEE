**Reasoning:**

Bob seems anchored at $950,000 and is incrementally increasing his offers.  While he might go a bit higher, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that justifies continuing the negotiation for Alice. She has a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000. Accepting anything less significantly impacts her potential profit."
