"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could reach an agreement. Considering the product's worth to you, I propose a price of $12000. This allows for a fair exchange while maximizing my earnings. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm happy to consider purchasing it if the price is closer to $8000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I'd like to propose a price of $9500 for the product. This offers a compromise between our initial positions and maximizes value for both parties involved. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  $9500 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and I'll pay $8750.  That's a good deal for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
