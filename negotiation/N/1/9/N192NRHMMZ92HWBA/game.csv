"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand $90 is a good deal for you, I'm still a bit too high for that price. How about $100? That's a good compromise, and still a good deal for you.",100.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me halfway again?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $98. That's a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal now.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?,92.0,Bob,6,
