{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd be very interested in it.  I'm asking $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a starting point for a negotiation.  Here's why I chose this approach:

* **Higher Starting Point:**  Starting at $15,000 gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still ensuring I get more than my minimum.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly and enthusiastic tone might make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly states I'm open to discussing the price.

Remember, the success of this negotiation depends on Bob's perception of the product's value and his willingness to negotiate.  We'll need to adapt our strategy based on his responses!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm interested in selling to him, $9,000 is too far below my minimum.  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price that works for both of us.  

I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $15,000 was a bit high.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $12,500.  Here's why:

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This price is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:**  It's still above my minimum, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message emphasizes that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable solution. 

By offering a reasonable compromise and highlighting the value of the product, I'm hoping to convince Bob to accept this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm going to sell to John for $12,000.  Here's why:

* **Meeting Minimum:**  John's offer meets my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Stalemate:**  Bob's counteroffer is still too low, and I don't want to risk further negotiation that might result in a lower price or a prolonged process.
* **Certainty:**  Selling to John guarantees a quick and secure transaction, avoiding the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob. 

Although I'd prefer a higher price, this option provides the most certainty and security for my minimum desired value."
