"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $14,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $14,000, which is still a bit above Bob's ideal price point. However, it's only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer and $1,000 less than John's offer.  Considering the potential for further negotiations, accepting this offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
