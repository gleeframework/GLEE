"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I can meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,250. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $11,250 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $10,900? ",10900.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already come down from $12,000 to $11,250, and now you're asking me to go down another $350. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11,475. What do you think?",11475.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,100? That's a fair deal for both of us.",11100.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,225. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",11225.0,Alice,7,
