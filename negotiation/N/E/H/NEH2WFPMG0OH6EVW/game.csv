"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and it's well worth the price! What do you think?",95.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you consider that price?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? This price is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $85 was a bit too low, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? That's the best I can do.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $92.50. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great value for you.  Let's see if we can make this work!",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $91.25. That's the best I can do.",91.25,Bob,6,
