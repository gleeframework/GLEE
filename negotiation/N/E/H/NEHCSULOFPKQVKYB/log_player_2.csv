Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get closer to his target price of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows for more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to reduce it further, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1080000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's desired price point of $1,000,000 while still being higher than his last counteroffer. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer, and the risk of further negotiation potentially resulting in a higher price is mitigated."
