"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  I understand this is a significant investment, so please don't hesitate to ask any questions you may have about the product.  If you're not interested, I'm confident I can find another buyer, but I believe this product could be a game-changer for your business.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product from John, there's no immediate reason to accept Alice's offer, even if it's the same price.  You want to see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting her offer gives you that opportunity."
