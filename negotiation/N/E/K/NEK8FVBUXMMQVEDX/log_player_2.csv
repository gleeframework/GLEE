"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $12,000. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you thinking of me, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within your budget. This shows you're serious about buying the product but also emphasizes your desire to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. While it's closer than her previous offer, you're still aiming to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to counter-offer gives you a chance to potentially reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not quite there with $13,500.  How about we split the difference and I pay $12,750?  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows that you're willing to negotiate but are still trying to stay within your budget. By offering to split the difference, it presents a compromise that feels reasonable without going below your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,750. I'm willing to go slightly higher, to $13,200. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above your maximum budget of $12,000. You've negotiated and tried to compromise, but it seems unlikely that Alice will go lower. To avoid further rounds of negotiation and ensure you get the product within your budget, buying from John at $12,000 is the best option."
