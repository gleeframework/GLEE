"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do better than $6,500, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $7,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $7,500. How about we try $7,250? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",7250.0,Alice,5,
