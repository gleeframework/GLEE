"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique and valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer is significantly higher.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering me this product.  However, $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in purchasing it for $10,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $18000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I put into acquiring it. I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $18,000 is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still higher than his desired value. Rejecting allows for further negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $15,000, which is a fair price considering the value I place on this product. I'm sure we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $15000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $17000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my original price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has already made several counteroffers, and Alice's latest offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000.  It's likely further negotiation will result in a price closer to Alice's desired price. Therefore, it's best to buy from John to save money."
