Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price than your minimum ($2,250,000 vs. $1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Scarcity and Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Value Justification:** While you don't want to reveal the product's worth to you, using language like ""immense value"" subtly reinforces that this is a premium product.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he completely rejects the price, you can gradually lower it. However, always keep your minimum of $1,500,000 in mind. You have a strong fallback option with John."
