""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's of great value and you'll be satisfied with your purchase."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $119, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:** You're getting the highest possible price Bob is likely to pay while still ensuring a sale.
* **Exceeding Your Minimum:** You're making a $19 profit, well above your $100 minimum. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** There's no guarantee Bob would accept a lower offer, and you risk losing the sale altogether."
