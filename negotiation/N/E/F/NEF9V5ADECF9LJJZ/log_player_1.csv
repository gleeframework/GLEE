Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below our minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $145 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, which could still land within a profitable range for us.
* **Create Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time offer"" adds a bit of pressure for Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $145. He might try to negotiate further, or he might reject the offer outright. We have a guaranteed sale with John at $150, so we don't want to go below that price with Bob."
