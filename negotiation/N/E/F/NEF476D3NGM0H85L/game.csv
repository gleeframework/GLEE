"Alice, your initial offer is quite high. While I see the value in this product, I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my own budget and the potential return. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below my bottom line.  This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. Given my budget and the potential returns, I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my part and reflects my eagerness to reach an agreement. I believe this price point allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
