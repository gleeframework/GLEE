,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $105. How about we split the difference and go with $110? This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we go with $107.50? That's the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to go down to $109. This price is fair, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think.",109.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $108, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price?",108.0,Bob,6,
