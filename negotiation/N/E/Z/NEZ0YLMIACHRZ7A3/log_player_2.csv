"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe this product will be extremely valuable for your business. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product and John is also offering it for the same price, rejecting Alice's offer makes sense. This gives you the opportunity to potentially negotiate a lower price with John."
