,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know if you're open to that.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $105 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's see if we can close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $95, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and offer it to you for $100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
