Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me, leaving room for negotiation.  This allows for a potential profit while giving Bob a chance to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I will reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $75 is a good offer, I can't go that low. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $82.50?"", ""product_price"": 82.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $78 is still slightly below my minimum desired price of $80, it's a reasonable compromise and closer to my goal than selling to John for $80.  I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
