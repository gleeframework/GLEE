Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $1,210,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not interested.

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Alice seems firm on her price, and while you might be able to push her a little further in the last round, it's unlikely to be a significant difference. Taking the deal at $1,225,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price."
