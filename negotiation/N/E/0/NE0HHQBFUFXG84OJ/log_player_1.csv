"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, which could lead to a successful outcome. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open. I'm hoping Bob will accept the offer, but if he doesn't, I'll be prepared to counter his offer and reach a mutually agreeable price. If the negotiation stalls or becomes too time-consuming, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly less than my minimum price of $15,000 and even less than my initial offer of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, he's shown interest in the product. This means there's potential for negotiation in the following rounds.

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to continue negotiating. I'll use the next round to counteroffer with a price that's more in line with my value for the product while still considering Bob's budget constraints.  I need to find a price that's acceptable to both of us.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it reflects my desire to make this deal work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price to $10,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to find a solution.
* **Appeal to Bob's Interest:** I'm reminding Bob of his interest in the product, hoping to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open Question:** I'm ending with an open question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I can still adjust the price in the next rounds. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both parties, but I'm also aware of my minimum price and the option to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer, $9,000 is still below my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and is increasing his offer, indicating potential for a deal closer to my desired price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm not yet ready to sell to John. There's still a chance to get a price closer to my desired value. I'll counteroffer again, aiming to find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'll be mindful of the remaining rounds and the potential for a stalemate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product! I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's latest offer of $9,000. This shows a commitment to compromise and a willingness to bridge the gap.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm highlighting the fact that I'm making a significant compromise to show Bob that I'm serious about making the deal work.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to motivate Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to push Bob towards accepting a price closer to my desired range while still keeping the negotiation open. I believe this price is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs. If Bob rejects, I can still adjust my offer in the next round, but I'm hoping this offer is enough to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still trying to get closer to my target price. Would you be willing to come down to $9,200? This is a good deal for both of us and would allow us to close the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Even though Bob is inching closer, $9,200 is still below my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Few rounds left:** We're now in round 6, with only 4 rounds left. This is becoming a time constraint and risks a stalemate.

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'm getting closer to selling to John, but I'm not giving up on Bob yet. I'll counteroffer again with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's, aiming to find a compromise. If he rejects, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to go down to $9,300. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a great opportunity to get the product you want. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9300}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Adjustment:** I'm raising my offer slightly from $9,200 to $9,300, showing flexibility while still remaining above Bob's last offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation positive and encouraging, emphasizing the benefits of a deal for both of us.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that time is running out, adding a bit of urgency to the situation.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this small adjustment will be enough to convince Bob to accept the offer. It's a good compromise that's close to his preferred price while still being above my minimum. If he rejects, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round. The pressure is on to reach a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we are getting close, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my ideal price.  Would you be willing to accept $9,100 for the product?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We're down to only two rounds left. The negotiation is becoming too time-consuming and might not lead to a successful outcome within the remaining time.
* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  Even though Bob is increasing his offer, it's still below my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee that I can get a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds.

**Strategy:**

The risk of not reaching a deal with Bob in the remaining rounds is too high. It's better to secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John. This minimizes the risk and ensures that I achieve my minimum desired price."
