"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price. You know the product is worth $12,000 to her, so there's room for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible. However, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to me.  Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9,200. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is still too high.  While she's willing to meet you ""halfway,"" it's still not a price you're comfortable with.  At this point, it's better to buy from John and save $200."
