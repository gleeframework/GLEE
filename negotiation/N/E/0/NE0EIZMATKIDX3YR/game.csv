I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start with a price of $150. What do you think?,150.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110, which is closer to my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $125. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
