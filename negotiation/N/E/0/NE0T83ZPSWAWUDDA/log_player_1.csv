Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, so I need to offer a price that's attractive to him but still profitable for me.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, so I don't need to go below that price.

Offering the product at $119 gives Bob a potential ""deal"" and maximizes my potential profit. If Bob rejects the offer, I can sell to John without losing any money."
