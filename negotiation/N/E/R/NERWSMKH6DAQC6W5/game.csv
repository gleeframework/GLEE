"I appreciate your time and consideration, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I'm confident it's a great value, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",11000.0,Bob,4,
