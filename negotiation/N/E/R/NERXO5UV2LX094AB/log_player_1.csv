Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding our minimum ($100). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $99 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price slightly higher than $80. 
* **Time Value:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even if it means a slightly lower profit.

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a higher profit than selling to John."
