# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth $12,000 to you. After careful consideration, I propose to sell it to you for $10,000. This offer reflects its true worth while allowing you to acquire it at a competitive price. I believe this is an opportunity not to be missed. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. While her message tries to persuade you of the product's value, you have a better alternative with John. By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or simply buy it from John for $12,000."
