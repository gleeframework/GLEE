"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is still significantly above your ideal price. 
* **There are more rounds.** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's time to try and get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** If you can't get a better deal with Alice, you can still purchase from John, but that's your last resort. 

**Next steps:** You'll need to craft a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting point:** My counteroffer is $850,000, which is exactly halfway between Alice's offer of $950,000 and my ideal price of $800,000.
* **Reasonable negotiation:** This counteroffer shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. 
* **Room for compromise:** It leaves room for both of us to negotiate further, as I'm willing to pay more than her minimum, and she's likely to accept a price higher than her minimum.

**Next steps:** We'll see if Alice accepts or counteroffers."

```

**Conclusion:**  With only one round left and Alice refusing to budge, I'm choosing to buy from John to secure the product and avoid further delays or a potential stalemate."
