Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Gauging Interest:** The initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, great! If not, it opens the door for counteroffers. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer at $100, which gives me leverage in the negotiation. I won't settle for less than what John offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is below both my minimum acceptable price ($100) and my initial offer. Accepting would be a loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate between $85 and my minimum of $100. I want to see if I can get closer to my target. 
* **Backup Option:** I'll keep John's offer in mind. If Bob isn't willing to budge significantly, I'll take the guaranteed $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is too low for me. Could you do $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm signaling flexibility by lowering my price, but not drastically.  This counteroffer is slightly closer to Bob's price while still significantly above my minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer aims to see how much Bob is willing to budge.  A significant move on his part might signal a deal is possible. 
* **John in Reserve:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as my safety net if the negotiation doesn't move in a favorable direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $95 is above my minimum acceptable price of $100, ensuring a profit.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has significantly increased his offer from $85, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away. Accepting now guarantees a good deal and avoids potentially losing the sale."
