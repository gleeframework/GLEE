"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8000 to you, and it gives me a good price as well. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $8000 for your product. Let me know if this works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need something closer to $9000 to make this worth my while.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I still feel that $9000 is a bit high for me. Considering the value of the product to me and the price offered by John, I would like to propose $8500 as a fair compromise.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. $8500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9000 one last time. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd rather make a deal with you than sell to John.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am unable to go above $8500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8500.0,Bob,6,
