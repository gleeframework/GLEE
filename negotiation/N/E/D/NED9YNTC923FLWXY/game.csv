"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given my research and the product's current market value, I'm willing to offer $1,750,000. This price reflects the true worth of the product while still allowing for a fair profit for you. I'm confident this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,100,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's work towards finding a middle ground that benefits us both.",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,950,000, which is a substantial offer and represents a fair compromise. I'm confident this is a price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1950000.0,Bob,6,
