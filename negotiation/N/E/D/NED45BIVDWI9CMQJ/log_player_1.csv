Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  By starting at $15,000, we can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, we've maximized our profit. If he negotiates, we can still work down towards our minimum of $12,000.
* **Alternative Option:**  We have the safety net of John who will buy the product for $12,000. This knowledge empowers us to be firm in our negotiations with Bob."
