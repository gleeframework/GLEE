"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,325,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous offers at $1,300,000. This price represents a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident that the product will be worth this investment.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm going to offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is just above my budget.  Let's split the difference one more time and try $1,325,000.  I think this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $1,325,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm going to offer the product to you for $1,380,000. This is my final concession, and I hope you can meet me here.",1380000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,380,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. To close this deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  This price reflects a reasonable compromise and allows both of us to make a profitable deal.",1350000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $1,350,000. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I need to consider other options. I'm going to offer the product to you for $1,395,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in this product.",1395000.0,Alice,9,
