Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $1,350,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,395,000 is still higher than my target price and there's only one round left.  With only one round remaining, it's likely we won't be able to reach an agreement that significantly benefits me.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,500,000. While it's not the ideal price, it ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further potentially unsuccessful negotiation."
