Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm setting the price at $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values it at $10,000, Alice needs to offer a price that's appealing but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John guarantees Alice at least $12,000, giving her leverage.

**The Offer:**

* $11,500 is a strong starting point. It's above Bob's valuation, but the slightly discounted ""pre-listing"" framing might entice him.
* The message is polite and suggests potential flexibility (""What do you think?""), leaving room for Bob to counter-offer.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** Alice gets a great price.
* **Bob negotiates:**  They have room to bargain within the $11,500 - $12,000 range.
* **Bob rejects:** Alice sells to John for her guaranteed $12,000."
