Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Secure the Sale:** Offering a price too close to $15,000 might discourage Bob, while going too low might seem disrespectful or undervalue the product.  

This strategy balances ambition with the need to secure a deal,  especially considering the guaranteed $12,000 backup offer from John."
