"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you my product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe a price of $20,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $10,000 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could you do $11,500? I think that would be a fair deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tighter budget.  $11,500 is a bit too low for me to accept.  How about $14,000?  That's a significant discount from my original offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, I can get a similar product for $12,000 elsewhere. If you're able to come down to that price, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I might have to go with the other option.",12000.0,Bob,6,
