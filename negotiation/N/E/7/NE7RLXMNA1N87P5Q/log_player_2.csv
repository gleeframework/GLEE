Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

At this point, Alice is down to $8,200.  While she might be willing to go a little lower, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is a better deal than the uncertainty of further negotiation with Alice."
