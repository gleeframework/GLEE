Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  By starting at $119, I'm aiming for the highest possible price Bob might accept, maximizing potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is my initial offer, there might be room for slight negotiation if Bob pushes back, getting us closer to the middle ground between his valuation and mine.
* **Considering the Guaranteed Sale:** I know John will buy the product for $120, so I don't want to go below that price with Bob."
