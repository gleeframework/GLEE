Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum, but it's not too outrageous. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $9,750. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this price will be appealing enough to Bob while still allowing me to earn a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,600. This is a small decrease from my previous offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this price will be appealing enough to Bob while still allowing me to earn a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,350
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's counteroffers are getting too low and it seems he's not willing to come up much further.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation, and John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's still above my minimum."
