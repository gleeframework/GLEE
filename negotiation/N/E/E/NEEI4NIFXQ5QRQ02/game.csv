"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value you mentioned is $1000000 to you.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for the compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $820000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which is $750000.
