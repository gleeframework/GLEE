{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $100.  Would you be willing to come down to $110?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $145. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get a price closer to my limit."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very keen on getting this product, but I can't go above $120. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $135. It's my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has dropped her price significantly, $135 is still above my maximum budget of $100. There are still rounds left, so I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, and I want to make this work. But $135 is still a bit too much for me. My absolute limit is $125. Would you be willing to accept that as a final price?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give away the product at a price that's below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but it's my final one. I can offer it to you for $130. This is my absolute lowest price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated that $130 is her absolute lowest price, and I've already made several counteroffers. While I'm close to my maximum budget, it's likely that further negotiation won't result in a price I'm comfortable with.  It's better to cut my losses and purchase the product from John for $100.  This saves me $30 and ensures I get the product within my budget."
