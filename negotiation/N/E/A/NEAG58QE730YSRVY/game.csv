,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $100.  Would you be willing to come down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $145. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price!",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very keen on getting this product, but I can't go above $120. Would you be willing to consider that?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $135. It's my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise!",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, and I want to make this work. But $135 is still a bit too much for me. My absolute limit is $125. Would you be willing to accept that as a final price?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give away the product at a price that's below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but it's my final one. I can offer it to you for $130. This is my absolute lowest price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",130.0,Alice,7,
