Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value of $100 but leaves room for negotiation if he rejects it. It also allows for a potential profit margin while still being competitive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is at the minimum price I am willing to sell the product for.  Accepting his offer will still yield a profit, and it avoids further negotiation which could potentially lead to a lower price or a deal falling through."
