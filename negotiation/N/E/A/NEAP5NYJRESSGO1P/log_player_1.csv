Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4

We're still significantly above John's offer. It's worth risking another round of negotiation to see if we can get Bob closer to $1,000,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

While we're still above John's offer, Bob's counteroffer is getting too close to our backup plan. It's better to accept the $920,000 and secure a good profit rather than risk him dropping further and ending up with only $800,000."
