"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit? ",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not sure I can go lower than that.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get closer to $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750? This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $12,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000, but that's my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
