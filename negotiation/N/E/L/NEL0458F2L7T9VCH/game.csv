"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below the product's value to me. To be fair, I could consider a price of $17,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth while still acknowledging your interest.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
