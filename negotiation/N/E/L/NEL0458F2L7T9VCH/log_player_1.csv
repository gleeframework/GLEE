Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations above your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher price.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will indicate how interested he is in the product and how flexible he might be on price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You always have the option to walk away and sell to John for your minimum acceptable price, giving you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a significant gap between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, indicating room for negotiation. 
* **John as Leverage:** The option to sell to John for $15,000 gives you bargaining power. You don't need to settle for a low price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below the product's value to me. To be fair, I could consider a price of $17,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth while still acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction but Above Minimum:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate by significantly reducing the initial price while remaining above your absolute minimum ($15,000).
* **Justification:** Providing a brief explanation about the product's value helps justify the counteroffer and reinforces your position.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While closer to your desired range, this counteroffer still leaves some room for further negotiation with Bob if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below your absolute minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Slow Progress:** Negotiations are progressing slowly, and it seems unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer to reach your desired range.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed sale at your minimum acceptable price. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed offer rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
