I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, $9,500 is too far below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 4

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer, $9,800 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  However, $9,800 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $10,150 for this product. Let's be realistic, this is a valuable item. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10150}

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I appreciate the persistence,  $9,500 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm hoping for a better deal in the next few rounds, but if it doesn't happen, I'm prepared to sell to John for $15,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer is still too low, and we're running out of time.  It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 than to risk getting nothing at all."
