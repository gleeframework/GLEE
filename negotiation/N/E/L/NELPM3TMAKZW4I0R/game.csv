"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While I'm confident in the value this product offers, I'm willing to adjust. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,225,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for me to make work. How about we settle at $1,150,000? That's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
