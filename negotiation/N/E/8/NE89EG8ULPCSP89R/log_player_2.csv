"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get an even lower price from Alice.  If the negotiation fails, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $9,500, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still a fair price given my maximum budget of $12,000.  This counteroffer shows I'm serious about buying the product but am also looking for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is very close to my ideal price, and I don't want to risk losing this opportunity.  While I could potentially negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and having to buy from John at a higher price."
