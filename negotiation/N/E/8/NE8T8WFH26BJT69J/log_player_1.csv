Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Considering the potential value you've described, I'm willing to offer $900000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the fair market value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
