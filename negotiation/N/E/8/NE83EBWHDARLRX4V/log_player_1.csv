"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $145? Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer. I'm willing to take another round to try and get a better price, and if it doesn't work out, I can always sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $130 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $137.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 137.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I've reached my limit for negotiation and don't want to risk losing more time. John is a guaranteed sale at a higher price, so I'll take the deal with him."
