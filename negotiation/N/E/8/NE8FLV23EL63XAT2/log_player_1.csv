Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $1,400,000 or close to it is a substantial profit over my $1,200,000 minimum and John's offer."
