Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to your minimum acceptable price ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, so there's no need to go below that price. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiating style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value."
