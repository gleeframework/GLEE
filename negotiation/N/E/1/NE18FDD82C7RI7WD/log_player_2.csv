"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  $1,200,000 is still more than Alice's value of $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for profit for her. It's a good starting point for negotiation, and it signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only slightly lower than her initial offer. This suggests she's not willing to budge much.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for further bargaining. There's still room to potentially get a lower price, and  I want to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from my previous offer, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer of $1,250,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to my desired range. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting higher, not lower. This suggests that she is firm in her price and might not be willing to negotiate further. However, I am still hopeful that I can get a better price than $1,300,000.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me more rounds to try and convince her to drop her price.  There's still a chance she might come down if I counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows a willingness to compromise, but I am still pushing for a price below Alice's current offer. It's important to acknowledge that Alice has been firm so far, but I'm hoping that by offering a price closer to her current offer, she might be willing to accept. If not, I can still fall back on the alternative option of purchasing from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice continues to raise her offer.  This indicates that she is unlikely to budge.  However,  I still have 3 rounds left, and I am determined to get the best possible price.  Rejecting her offer allows me to make a counteroffer again. This time, I might need to be more aggressive and propose a lower price that will put more pressure on her to accept.  If she doesn't, I will have to evaluate if it's worth it to continue negotiating or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has been steadily increasing her offer, showing she's unlikely to go below $1,300,000.  However, I still have two rounds left and am determined to try and reach an agreement. This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price that is higher than my previous one but still lower than Alice's current offer.  I'm hoping this will signal a willingness to meet halfway and encourage Alice to accept.  If she rejects, I'll have to weigh the risk of buying from John or making a final, lower counteroffer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting dangerously close to John's price. With only one round left, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing out on the deal is high. It's better to secure the product at a known price, even if it's slightly higher. The difference between John's price and Alice's current offer is $100,000, which is a reasonable cost to ensure the purchase. There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the product entirely.  Buying from John guarantees I get the product, even if it's not the absolute lowest price."
