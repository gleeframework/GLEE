Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000. This still leaves room for profit for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,125,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $1,175,000 for this product. This is a fair price, considering the value and the fact that we've already been negotiating for several rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate but is holding firm around the $1,175,000 mark.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price, and waiting could risk her withdrawing the offer entirely. Accepting at $1,175,000 secures the product below John's price and avoids potentially losing the deal."
