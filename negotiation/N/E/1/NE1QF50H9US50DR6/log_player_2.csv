"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! I'm excited to make you an offer. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000.

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,750.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a final offer of $9,900, which is only slightly lower than her previous offer and still above my budget. While I could continue negotiating, I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product entirely.  It's best to buy the product from John at $8,000 to ensure I get the product at my desired price."
