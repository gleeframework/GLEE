Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and aims to justify the high price, making it more palatable for Bob to consider. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer helps you gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. If he rejects it outright, you haven't lost anything and can still sell to John.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while considering the fallback option of selling to John."
