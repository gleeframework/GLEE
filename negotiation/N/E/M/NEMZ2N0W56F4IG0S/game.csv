"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $6,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that considers its value to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my current budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,000? That's the absolute maximum I can offer at this time.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is the maximum you can offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
