Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to buy it for $120.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $128. This is still a great price for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $128 is still a little too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $120.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it if you accept."", ""product_price"": 120}
