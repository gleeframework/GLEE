"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to buy it for $120.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $128. This is still a great price for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal!",128.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $128 is still a little too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $120.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it if you accept.",120.0,Bob,4,
