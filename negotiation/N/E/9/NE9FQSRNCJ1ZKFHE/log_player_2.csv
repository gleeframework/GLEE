Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
