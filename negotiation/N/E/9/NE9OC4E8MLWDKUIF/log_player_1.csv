Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, offering it at $14,000 allows you to maximize your profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($1,000).
* **First-mover Advantage:** By offering Bob the product first, you create a sense of exclusivity and urgency. This can potentially lead to a quicker sale at a higher price.
* **Safety Net:** You have John as a backup buyer at $12,000, ensuring you won't be forced to go below your minimum acceptable price."
