"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm starting with a significant markup over my minimum.  This allows for potential concessions while still achieving a good outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's my minimum.  I want to see if I can get a better price, and I have time for negotiations.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,800,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  It also leaves room for potential further negotiation if needed.  My goal is to find a price that is both fair and profitable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept anything lower than $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. I'm still above my minimum price, but getting closer to Bob's offer, leaving room for potential agreement."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's getting risky to continue with Bob, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer from him.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's a guaranteed profit, and I'm confident that I can find a better buyer in the future."
