Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to get a little concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me halfway. I'll offer you the product for $777,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach a deal.

It's getting too risky to continue negotiating. Alice is clearly very firm on her price, and we're unlikely to get a significantly better deal in the last round. Accepting $777,500 ensures we get a good price without the risk of losing the deal entirely."
