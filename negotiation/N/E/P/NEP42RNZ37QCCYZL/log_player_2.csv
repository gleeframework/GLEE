"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $150 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $120. This is a good price, but Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. 
*  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. 
* A counteroffer of $100 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $120.
* This price is still within Bob's budget and likely attractive to Alice, who values the product at $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $110 is a better deal than buying from John for $150.
* While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and being forced to buy from John at a higher price is too high. 
* Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price within his budget."
