"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to start with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more than my starting price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still far below what the product is worth to Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise that hopefully demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still getting a price closer to my desired value."
