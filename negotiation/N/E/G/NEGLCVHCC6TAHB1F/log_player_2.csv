"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. It also leaves room for further negotiation, as it's still higher than what Alice would be willing to sell for. This strategy aims to maximize Bob's savings while keeping the negotiations open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his maximum budget of $1,500,000 and leaves him with a comfortable margin.  While further negotiation is always an option, accepting this offer secures the product at a favorable price, and continuing negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether."
