"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs and it's worth a significant amount to me due to its value.  I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth around $8,000 to me, so I could consider buying it for a price closer to that. Would you be willing to go significantly lower?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product has a lot of value and I'm confident it can bring you a lot of benefit. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it has value to you, but $14,000 is still much higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I could potentially go up to $7,000, but that's really my limit.  If that doesn't work for you, I might need to explore other options.",7000.0,Bob,4,
