Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly higher than my guaranteed minimum of $15,000 from John, giving me a potential profit. 
* This offer allows for negotiation. If Bob isn't willing to pay $20,000, we can discuss a lower price. 
* I'm taking a calculated risk by going higher than my minimum. However, the potential reward of a higher sale price outweighs the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
