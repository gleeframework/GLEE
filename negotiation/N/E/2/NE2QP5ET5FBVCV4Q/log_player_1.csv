"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what Bob values the product at, but significantly below my minimum. This gives him some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is a decent amount, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's so far below what I know the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, I still feel there's room for further negotiation. I'm going to try to push for a slightly higher price, but I'm also aware that time is ticking."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see where you're coming from, but $110 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference at $115? I'm confident you'll find this product extremely valuable, and I'm ready to make this deal happen. "", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $112? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $112 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum and I'm running out of time.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a sale and a decent profit without risking a deal falling through."
