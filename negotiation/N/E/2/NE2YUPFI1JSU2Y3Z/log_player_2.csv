"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to start with a fair price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my target price of $1,200,000 but below the price John is offering. This leaves room for negotiation. It's in my best interest to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, and I need to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within my budget and is a good deal considering she's willing to meet me halfway. It's also better than the price John is offering, so I'll accept it."
