"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to start with a fair price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, and I need to make a profit.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
