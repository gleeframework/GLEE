"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a good starting offer from Alice, but there's room for negotiation. You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000 and she's offering $950,000.  It's worth seeing if you can get a better price by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your true ceiling. This leaves room for negotiation and gives you an idea of Alice's flexibility. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message strikes a balance between being appreciative of Alice's time and clearly stating your price point.  
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer aims to bring Alice closer to the middle ground between your initial offer and her asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $800,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its true value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to your desired price range, but there's still room for negotiation. She came down $50,000, indicating a willingness to deal.  You can likely get a better price by countering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  How about we settle at $850,000?  That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer proposes meeting directly in the middle of the current price gap. It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Seeking Closure:** The language is designed to signal that you're nearing a point where you'd be comfortable making a deal. This can encourage Alice to seriously consider your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice has slowed down significantly in her price drops.  This suggests she's nearing her bottom line.
* **Good Deal:**  $875,000 is a solid price, well below your maximum budget, and a significant savings from John's offer or Alice's starting price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has a chance of getting a slightly better price, but it also risks Alice standing firm or you needing to walk away and pay more with John. Accepting now secures a good deal."
