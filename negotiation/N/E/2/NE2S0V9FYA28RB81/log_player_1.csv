Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price, as it's above my minimum threshold and leaves some room for negotiation. I believe it's likely Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to counter if he offers a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm confident that I can convince him to pay closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $112. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still getting closer to my desired price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair middle ground and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $108 is still better than selling to John for $100.  I'm going to accept his offer to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
