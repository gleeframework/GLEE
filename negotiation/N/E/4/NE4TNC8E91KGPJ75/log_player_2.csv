"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $15,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It signals to Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but you're not willing to pay her asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice has come down from her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum value. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as it's still possible to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
``` 

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, closer to Alice's last offer but still within Bob's price limit. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a firm stance on the maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is not willing to come down to Bob's price point, and continuing to negotiate is unlikely to change that. It's time to cut losses and buy the product from John for a guaranteed price of $15,000."
