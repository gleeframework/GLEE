"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9000. I understand it's a bit higher than your target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10500, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $10000, which is the lowest I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
