This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a price closer to my minimum by using a combination of persuasion and calculated counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still do better. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close.  He's stated this is his final offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and ensures I earn a decent profit."
