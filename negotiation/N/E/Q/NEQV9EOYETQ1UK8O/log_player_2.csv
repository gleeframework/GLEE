# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer
