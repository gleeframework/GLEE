"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your consideration of the product's value. However, I'm afraid I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $920000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while also being reasonable for you. What are your thoughts?",920000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above that price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $870000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",870000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit above the price I'm comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can meet you at $900000, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this point. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit above $900000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $880000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",880000.0,Bob,6,
