Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a bit lower than my minimum value of $120, but it gives Bob a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping he'll accept, but if not, I'm prepared to counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter with $100.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this price is attractive enough to Bob, but still gives me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is too low for me.  It's below my minimum value of $120 and I'm not willing to go that low.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'll sell the product to him."
