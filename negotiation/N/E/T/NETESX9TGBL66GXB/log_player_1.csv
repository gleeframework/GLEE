Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so anything less is unacceptable.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):** Exists between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, leaving room for negotiation while staying above your minimum. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, there's less pressure to accept a low offer.

**Offer**

```json
{
  ""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
  ""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,100,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Confident Tone:** The message implies the product's value without being overly aggressive.
* **Open to Discussion:**  ""Let me know your thoughts"" invites Bob to counter-offer, opening a dialogue.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob doesn't offer a price above your $1,200,000 guarantee, you're better off selling to John.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  This initial offer is just the start. Be prepared to counter-offer and find a price within the ZOPA that works for both of you."
