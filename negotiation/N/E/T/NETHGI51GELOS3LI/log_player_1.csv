Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has hit his maximum price at $1,000,000. While this is a good offer, it's still $200,000 less than what John is offering.  At this point, continuing the negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer. Selling to John ensures receiving the full value of the product without further risk or delay."
