"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more realistic.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider $1,400,000. This reflects the worth of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but we're still pretty far apart. I can go up to $950,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to make sure it aligns with my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about making this work for your budget.  How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's worth.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, that's closer, but still a tough pill for me to swallow. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. That's the absolute maximum I can justify for this purchase.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
