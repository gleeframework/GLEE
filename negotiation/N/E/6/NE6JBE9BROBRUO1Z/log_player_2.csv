Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do better than $800000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $875000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

Alice has come down significantly from her original offer, and $875,000 is still within your budget and saves you a substantial amount compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal."
