Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $700,000.  I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I know the product is worth.  I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price."
