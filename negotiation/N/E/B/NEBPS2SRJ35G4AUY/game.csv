"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your valuation is understandable,  $1,000,000  is significantly below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This acknowledges the product's value to both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
