Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a good deal given his perceived value of $15,000. 
* **The message** is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired price range.  I believe I can negotiate a better price, so I will reject his offer and proceed to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable going down to $10,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $11,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to maintain a positive tone, acknowledging Bob's offer while still advocating for a higher price. I'm also emphasizing the value proposition to him again. 

This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise but still aim for a price that's closer to my desired value."
