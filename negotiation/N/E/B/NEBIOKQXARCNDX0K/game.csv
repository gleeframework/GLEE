"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm very interested in the product but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While I believe the product offers significant value at $1,350,000, I'm willing to move a bit closer. How about we settle at $1,275,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true worth of what's on offer.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
