"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a quality product like this, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  This product truly delivers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.  How about we settle at $11,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
