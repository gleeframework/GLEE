"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I can't go as low as $11500.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $13250? This gives you a great deal and is still fair for me.  What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $12750. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",12750.0,Bob,4,
