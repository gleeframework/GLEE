"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $115? I'm really interested in this product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get a fair return on the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $125 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $120.  That way, we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,4,
