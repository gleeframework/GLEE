"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than $15,000, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a little less. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product is worth more to me than that. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price:** $13,500 is closer to Bob's maximum budget of $15,000 and significantly lower than John's price.
* **Further negotiation might not be fruitful:** Alice has already rejected a lower offer, suggesting she might not budge much further. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's a risk Alice might walk away or increase her price.

Overall, accepting this offer is the best strategy for Bob to get the product at a decent price and avoid the risk of a higher price or losing the deal entirely."
