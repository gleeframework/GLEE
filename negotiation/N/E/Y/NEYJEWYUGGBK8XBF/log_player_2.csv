"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for a price that I believe is fair to both of us. Given its value to you, I'm sure you'll find this deal attractive.  Let's discuss a price of $1,000,000.  This would allow me to achieve a good return while still providing you with significant value.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation with Alice to get a price closer to her $800,000 valuation."
