Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but still significantly less than my minimum value. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob decides to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value than his initial rejection, it's still below my desired price. I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $14,000, which is still above Bob's last offer but closer to a potential deal. This shows flexibility while keeping the price higher than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that John will buy the product for $15,000, which is a better outcome for me."
