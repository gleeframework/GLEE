"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be totally transparent, $1,050,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  I understand if that doesn't work for you.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is the highest you can go, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this level.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
