"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it extremely useful. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $650000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you consider meeting me in the middle?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650000 is a significant amount, but I'm still willing to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $750000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another serious offer. I was thinking of $700000, which is closer to my target. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point. Can you consider this offer?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot by meeting you halfway earlier. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $725000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for both of us.",725000.0,Alice,5,
