"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. While I value it at $1,200,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that is still below my asking price.  Consider this a special offer, as I am confident you will find this product to be a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's offer is below her valuation, you can get the product for a significantly cheaper price from John ($800,000).  There's no need to spend the extra $200,000."
