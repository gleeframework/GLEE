"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but still ensures I get close to my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $11,000 is still too low for me, and I believe there's room to negotiate higher. I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $12,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant. I'm going to reject this offer and see if Bob will increase his offer again in the next round. It's still early in the negotiation, and I believe I can potentially get closer to my minimum price of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but I believe it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to increase his offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's the highest he's offered so far, it's still below my minimum desired price. With only 4 rounds remaining, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000 again. Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm hoping to see if he'll finally budge with only three rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to get a better offer from Bob. Even though $11,900 is close to my desired price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure I get my minimum desired price. I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed deal for a potential offer from Bob that might not materialize."
