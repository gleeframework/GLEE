**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is holding firm at $1,225,000. While this is less than our ideal price, it's still a significant profit above our minimum.  Continuing to negotiate risks:

* **Losing the deal:** Bob might walk away if we push too hard.
* **Wasting time:**  We have other opportunities and limited rounds. 

Accepting $1,225,000 secures a good profit now."
