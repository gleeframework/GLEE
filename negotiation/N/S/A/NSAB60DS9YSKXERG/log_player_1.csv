Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm aiming for a lower price point. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

``` 

Bob is consistently moving towards a price that's beneficial for both of us.  I'm not willing to settle for $1,250,000 just yet, but I also don't want to scare him off.  I'll make another counteroffer to keep the negotiation going."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price.  Let's settle this right now. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

Bob is clearly very interested and is slowly but surely meeting my price expectations.  While I could try to push for a little more, accepting his offer of $1,275,000 guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
