```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and engaging in this discussion.  While $1,200,000 is a respectable figure, the product's inherent value to you is undeniably higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000.  This offer reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than your desired price point.  You can likely negotiate further to get closer to your target of $1,200,000.  Rejecting this offer keeps you in the negotiation and allows you to explore a lower price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price.  Let's settle this right now. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, but it's still higher than your desired price.  There is a chance she might budge a bit more if you reject her offer again. You still have some room to negotiate, and you're not desperate to buy the product from John yet, as his price is still higher.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to see if Alice is willing to come down further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
