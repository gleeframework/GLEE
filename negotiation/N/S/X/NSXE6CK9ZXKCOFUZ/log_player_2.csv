# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe you'll find it to be a great value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $90.** This is better than buying from John for $100.
* **You want to save money.** Even though you value the product at $100, accepting Alice's offer means you save $10."
