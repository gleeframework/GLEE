"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I can try to negotiate a better price closer to her value of $12,000.  I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,500?"", 
""product_price"": 12500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with an offer slightly above Alice's perceived value of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation but shows I'm serious about buying.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  My message aims to keep the negotiation amicable while clearly stating my price target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about $13,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but $13,500 is still too high. I have plenty of rounds left and know her product's value to her is lower. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000?"", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By offering $13,000, I'm splitting the difference between her current offer ($13,500) and my previous counteroffer ($12,500). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Creating Urgency:** While I have rounds left, I don't want to drag this out unnecessarily. Offering a reasonable compromise might encourage Alice to accept quickly."
