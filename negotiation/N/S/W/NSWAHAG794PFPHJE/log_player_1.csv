"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm giving Bob a reason to consider the offer -  ""amazing product"", ""you'd really love"". This might make him more receptive.
* **Open-Ended:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to respond with his thoughts rather than a simple ""yes"" or ""no""."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $140 is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate for a sale and helps maintain my leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $160?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm making a counter-offer, showing flexibility while still trying to get closer to my desired price.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm again providing a reason for the price by mentioning the ""value of the product."" 
* **Moderate Adjustment:** I'm lowering my price by $15, which is a significant enough reduction to show I'm willing to compromise, but still keeps me above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, would it be possible to reach an agreement at $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 matches my minimum acceptable price.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with no deal. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, I risk losing time and potentially having to sell to John for the same price. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and certain sale at my minimum price, which is a good outcome."
