"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to sell it to you at this price today. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1700000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1900000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1750000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. Can we meet in the middle again?",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1850000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though - I'll meet you at $1820000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1820000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1750000, but I think that's the absolute maximum I can go. Can you consider that price?",1750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession - I'll meet you at $1780000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to move forward at this price. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1780000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm afraid $1780000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1750000, but I think that's the absolute maximum I can go. Can you consider that price?",1750000.0,Bob,8,
