"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll receive from this product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
