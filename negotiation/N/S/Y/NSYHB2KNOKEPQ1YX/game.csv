"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $110 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $97.50. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",97.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer of $85, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $92.50. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.50, which is a good middle ground for both of us. Let me know if you're open to that.",87.5,Bob,6,
