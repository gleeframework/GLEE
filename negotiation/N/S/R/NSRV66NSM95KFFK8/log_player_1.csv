"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that holds immense value. Given its potential, I'm initially valuing it at $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to discuss."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting high ($1,400,000) to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum ($1,000,000). 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This high initial offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to buy. A quick acceptance means he might have been willing to pay even more. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000.  This allows me to negotiate confidently with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is a more comfortable price range for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. Bob's message indicates he's interested and willing to negotiate, so I'll aim for a price closer to $1,350,000.  I'm not willing to go below that at this point, as I still have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer aims for a compromise. It shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still pushing for a higher price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $1,350,000 is a strong position â€“ it's a significant profit above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Time Consideration:**  We're still in the early rounds, so I'm not overly concerned about reaching a deal immediately. I'd rather spend a few rounds trying to secure the best possible price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has held firm at $1,300,000 for two rounds, signaling this is likely his upper limit. While I'd prefer $1,350,000,  accepting $1,300,000 ensures a substantial profit ($300,000 above my minimum) and avoids the risk of pushing Bob away completely. It's always possible he could walk away in later rounds, leaving me to settle for John's offer."
