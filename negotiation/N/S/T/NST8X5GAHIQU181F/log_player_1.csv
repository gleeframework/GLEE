Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

We're still significantly above John's offer.  Let's see if we can nudge Bob a little higher."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,650,000. I think this is the best we can do considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000

While we could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,650,000 is a significant profit over John's offer."
