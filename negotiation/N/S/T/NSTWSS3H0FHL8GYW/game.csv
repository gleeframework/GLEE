"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, however.  My new offer is $1,600,000.  This is still a great price for such a valuable product, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.  Let's work towards a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,550,000, which is a significant step closer to my limit.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for a successful transaction.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
