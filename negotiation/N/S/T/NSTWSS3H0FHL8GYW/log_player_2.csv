"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this exceptional product.  I know its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My initial offer is $1,750,000.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget.  It's best to start negotiating to see if you can get the price down.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by dropping the price significantly,  showing Alice that you are serious about getting a deal but also leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to be firm but not overly aggressive in the first counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, however.  My new offer is $1,600,000.  This is still a great price for such a valuable product, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.  Let's work towards a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting her offer allows you to make another counteroffer to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,550,000, which is a significant step closer to my limit.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for a successful transaction."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to move the price closer to your maximum budget. It's a good compromise that demonstrates your willingness to reach an agreement but still leaves room for Alice to counter if she needs to."
