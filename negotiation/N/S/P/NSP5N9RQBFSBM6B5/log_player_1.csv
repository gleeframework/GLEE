Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $6,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down, but $14,000 is still a stretch for me. I'd be willing to go up to $7,500, but that's really my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet a price that reflects the product's value to me. It's time to move on and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
