Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum ($120). 
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's inclined, potentially getting you even closer to $120. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
