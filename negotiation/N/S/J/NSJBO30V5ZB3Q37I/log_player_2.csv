"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  You can potentially get the product for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your desired profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for compromise. It also acknowledges her desired profit while remaining within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my desired profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good deal. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and still provides Alice with a reasonable profit.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price, so accepting this offer is the most logical choice to save money."
