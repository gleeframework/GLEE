"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have a significant buffer of $500,000 before you need to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and hopefully forces Alice to consider my offer seriously. It's also a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for further negotiation.  I'm willing to take a chance on getting an even better deal by rejecting this offer and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is still significantly lower than Alice's previous offer, but it's a reasonable step toward a possible agreement.  I'm hoping to reach a middle ground with Alice without having to go too close to her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $50,000 away from my last counteroffer.  Considering the potential for further negotiation, the risk of rejection, and the possibility of having to pay John $1,000,000, it's wiser to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that's still within my budget.  I've saved a considerable amount compared to John's price, and it's likely that continuing to negotiate might not result in a significantly better price."
