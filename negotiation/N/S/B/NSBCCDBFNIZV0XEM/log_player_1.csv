Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $140. Can you consider it?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer, as $140 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $140 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145

While $145 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to $150 to make this deal work. I'm willing to go down to $155.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $155. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $152.50. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $152.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $152.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $152.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to secure this sale than risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
