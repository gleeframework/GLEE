"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $13,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,500?  That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""You're right, $9,500 is a fair compromise, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. Would you be willing to do $10,500? That's only slightly above your last offer and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I'm eager to buy this product, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $9,750? It's a good compromise for both of us and could lead to a successful deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go above $10,000. He's consistently trying to split the difference, and we're already very close to his perceived value.  It's not worth risking further negotiation rounds for a potentially small gain when we have a guaranteed offer of $10,000 from John."
