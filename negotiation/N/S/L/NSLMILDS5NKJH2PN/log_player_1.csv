{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm starting the offer at $20,000, but I'm open to discussion. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting the offer at $20,000, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm highlighting that I'm willing to negotiate, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer if he's interested. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I mention the product being ""amazing"" and ""valuable"" to hopefully spark Bob's interest and make him think it's worth a higher price. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell for that low, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Counter Offer:** I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  By rejecting his offer, I can get a better sense of how determined Bob is to buy the product and what his upper limit might be.

I'm still hopeful of reaching a price closer to $15,000, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This reflects the unique value of this product and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoned Counteroffer:** I'm not just randomly throwing out a new number. I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product while also demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $17,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and respectful tone can encourage Bob to continue negotiations.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $17000 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below it.  While I could try to negotiate further, I'm not sure how much room there is for him to increase his offer. 

Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation. I've already spent a few rounds trying to get a higher price from Bob, and at this point, it's not worth the risk of further negotiations."
