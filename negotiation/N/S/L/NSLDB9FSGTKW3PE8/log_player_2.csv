"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, he should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $75 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $90. This offer is still within Bob's budget, and it shows Alice that he is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $85 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than his counteroffer. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to reach a price closer to his $75 counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown willingness to negotiate and is steadily getting closer to Alice's price. Offering $80 is a compromise, demonstrating a genuine interest in buying the product while still pushing for a lower price."
