"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is asking for $900,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **It's early in the game.** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better deal. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** You want to save as much money as possible, and John's price is your maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower price to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  While $700,000 is a big drop from $900,000, it's still above Alice's value of $800,000. This creates space for a potential deal. 
* **Testing the waters:**  I want to see if Alice is serious about selling. If she rejects this counteroffer, I'll adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.**  While her offer is closer to my desired price, it's still $150,000 above my desired price point.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** We have 7 rounds left, and I can continue to try and lower the price.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.**  I want to save as much money as possible.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 820000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Testing the limit:**  This counteroffer is very close to Alice's minimum price of $800,000. It shows that I'm serious about a deal but still want to get a good price. 
* **Showing flexibility:**  By increasing my offer from the previous round, I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Time is on my side:**  With 6 rounds left, I have time to see if Alice is willing to come down just a bit more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $830,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $830,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer:**  Her offer is just $30,000 above my last counteroffer. It's likely she's not going to go much lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk is that she'll walk away and I'll have to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Time is running out:** We're halfway through the negotiations. Accepting this offer secures the product for a price that's within my budget and significantly lower than John's offer."
