"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Building a relationship:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm prepared for Bob to counteroffer, but I'm starting with a price that leaves me a comfortable margin. 
* **Flexibility:** If the negotiation doesn't go well, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my desired price, $10,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 8 rounds left, so I can still try to get a better price from Bob.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I might encourage him to come back with a more substantial counteroffer in the next round. 
* **Minimizing losses:** Selling to John for $15,000 would guarantee my minimum price, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it gives us both a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing the value:**  I'm reminding Bob that $11,500 is still a good deal for him, considering the product's worth.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not letting Bob dictate the price. $11,500 is the lowest I'm willing to go for now. 
* **Keeping the door open:**  My message is friendly and invites Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $11,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $11,500. 
* **Time is ticking:** We are already in round 4, and I only have 6 rounds left before having to make a decision. 
* **Minimizing risk:** While I'd ideally like to get closer to $12,000,  accepting this offer guarantees me a sale and a decent profit. 
* **Potential for future deals:** Accepting this offer might build trust and open the door for future negotiations with Bob. 

**Overall:** I'm choosing to prioritize closing the deal and securing a profit over pushing for a slightly higher price that might be unattainable within the remaining rounds."
