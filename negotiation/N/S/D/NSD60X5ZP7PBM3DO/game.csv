"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe it can be a valuable asset for your business.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.  This price reflects its true value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This price is fair, allowing for a profit for you and a great deal for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a considerable sum, it falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still leaves room for a profitable outcome for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This price is a fair compromise, allowing both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
