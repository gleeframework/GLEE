# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe it can be a valuable asset for your business.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a considerable sum, it falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still leaves room for a profitable outcome for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
