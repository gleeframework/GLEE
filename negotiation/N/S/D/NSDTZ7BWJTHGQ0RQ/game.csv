"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is a bit pricey for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",950000.0,Alice,3,
