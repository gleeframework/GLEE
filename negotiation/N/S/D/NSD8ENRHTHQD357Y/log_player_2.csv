"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than your budget and John's offer. It's best to counteroffer and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your initial offer, $750,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

While Alice is moving closer to your budget, $1,250,000 is still significantly more than you need to spend. You should counteroffer again, pushing closer to your $1,000,000 limit, but leaving room for a final compromise."

Alice is consistently halving the difference, and you're getting close to your limit. One more counteroffer should either get you a price you're comfortable with, or it will be time to go with John."
