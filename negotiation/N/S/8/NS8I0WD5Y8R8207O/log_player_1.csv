"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking for something within my budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $120 matches my minimum acceptable price, I have the opportunity to sell to John for the same amount without further negotiation. It makes sense to take the guaranteed sale with John and avoid the risk of Bob potentially lowering his offer or the negotiation failing."
