I believe it's a significant value for you, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident this product will provide you with substantial benefits. Let me know if you're interested in proceeding. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Since you can get the product from John for your maximum price, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer."
