"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $750,000. I believe this is a fair price, reflecting both the product's worth and my ability to purchase it.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective, the $750,000 offer is quite a bit below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the value this product brings.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high. Given the value you've stated, I'm willing to go to $850,000. This would allow us both to make a reasonable deal without either of us needing to compromise too much.",850000.0,Bob,4,
