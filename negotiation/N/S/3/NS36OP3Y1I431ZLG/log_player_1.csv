"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 
**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation and signals that I believe the product is worth significantly more than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** The message frames the high price as a starting point for a ""win-win"" deal, suggesting potential flexibility. 
* **Information Gathering:**  Bob's response to this offer will give me valuable information about his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. That initial price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 to make this a worthwhile deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob to reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the true value of this product. To move things forward, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Firm:** I've lowered my initial price to show I'm willing to negotiate, but not drastically. This keeps me above my minimum and signals the product's value.
* **Test the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help gauge how serious Bob is and how much he's truly willing to pay. 
* **Keep John in Mind:**  I'm getting closer to John's offer, but there's still potential for a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but I have a budget in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a significant amount below what I believe is achievable. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more movement from his side.  I'm also getting close to the point where John's offer becomes increasingly attractive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $850,000 is still too low. How about we settle on $1,050,000?  That reflects the true value of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm lowering my price, but this time by a smaller amount to show I'm reaching my limit.
* **Shifting Focus:** The message emphasizes the product's value over my willingness to haggle, subtly increasing pressure on Bob.
* **Deadline Awareness:**  With each round, John's guaranteed offer becomes more appealing. This price is my last significant move before considering that option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $925,000 to finalize the deal. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $925,000 is a significant amount above my minimum and represents a successful negotiation.
* **""Final Offer"" Pressure:** Bob stating this is his final offer adds weight to his position and suggests he may not be willing to go higher.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could push for more in further rounds, the potential gains are outweighed by the risk of Bob walking away and accepting John's $1,000,000 offer becomes the better alternative."
