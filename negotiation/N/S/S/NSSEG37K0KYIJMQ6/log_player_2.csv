"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

$800,000 is a great price, but Bob can likely do better.  He should counteroffer to see if he can get closer to his target."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $900,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be thrilled with the value you'll get. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $900,000 is a good price, he can likely still get it lower.  He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his desired $700,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $850,000 is a good price, and he's unlikely to get a better offer from Alice.  It's also much lower than John's price of $1,200,000."
