"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $108? It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product.",108.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $110. How about we try $109? It's a small compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the quality of the product.",109.0,Alice,5,
