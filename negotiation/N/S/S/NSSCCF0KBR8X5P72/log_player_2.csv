"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $100. It's worth negotiating further to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $108? It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is getting closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $100.  It's worth pushing for a lower price and seeing if Alice is willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $108 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $102. "", ""product_price"": 102}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $110. How about we try $109? It's a small compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the quality of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $109 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  While it's closer than previous offers, Bob has already gone through several rounds of negotiation and is unlikely to get a better price from Alice.  Buying from John for $100 is the best option at this point, as it guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
