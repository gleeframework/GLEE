"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's a fair price for both of us. It's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $135. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $125 is very close to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $130. This is the middle ground between our last offers, and it's still above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $120. 

Bob's offer is now at my minimum, and while I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll get a higher price. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum, which is a better option than risking further negotiation with Bob."
