"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you reaching out.  While I see the value in your product, $14,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a good price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly below its value. I can come down to $12,000.  This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $9,500.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
