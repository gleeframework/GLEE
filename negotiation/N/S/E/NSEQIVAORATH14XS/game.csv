"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
