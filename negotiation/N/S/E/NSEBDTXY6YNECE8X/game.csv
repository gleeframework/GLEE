"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $12,000 for your product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $13,500?  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it still leaves room for you to get a great deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still looking for a price closer to my valuation of the product. I would like to propose a price of $12,500 for your product.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I want to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,000.  I believe this price is fair to both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
