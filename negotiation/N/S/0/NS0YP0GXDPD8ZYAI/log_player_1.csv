Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a good compromise for both of us: 

* **For me:** It's more than what Bob values it at, so I'm making a profit.
* **For Bob:** It's less than what I'd sell it to John for, so he's getting a better deal.

This way, there's a good chance Bob will accept the offer, and I'll avoid having to go through the hassle of selling to John."
