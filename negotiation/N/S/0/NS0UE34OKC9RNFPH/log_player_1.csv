Round 2
Bob's offer:

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Matching John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches what John is willing to pay.  
* **Time Value:** While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. Accepting now secures the sale and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer in future rounds.
* **Certainty:**  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Accepting this offer guarantees the sale."
