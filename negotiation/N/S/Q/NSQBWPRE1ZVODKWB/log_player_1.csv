Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price close to your minimum acceptable price ($150) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Slight Discount:**  Offering a small discount from your guaranteed price might make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and increase the likelihood of him accepting.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While $80 is Bob's perceived value, he might be willing to pay a bit more if he really wants the product.
* **Negotiation:** This initial offer sets the stage for potential negotiation. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob rejects the first offer, but don't go below your $150 minimum."
