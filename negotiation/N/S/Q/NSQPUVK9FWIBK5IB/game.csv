"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  $9,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could go up to $7,000. Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we are finding some common ground.  $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, it seems like we are getting close. How about we settle at $7,750? That's a fair price.",7750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, you are right, we are getting close!  $7,750 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. How about $8,250? ",8250.0,Alice,7,
