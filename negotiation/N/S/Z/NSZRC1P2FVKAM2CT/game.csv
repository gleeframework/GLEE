"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,000,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This represents a significant saving for you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that we could meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my target price. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up slightly to $900,000, which is closer to my target price and a more significant savings for you. Let's keep working towards a mutually agreeable deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in coming down, but $975,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is closer to our target prices and would allow us to close this deal. Let's reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's aim for a truly mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to offer $960,000 for the product. This is a fair price that gets us closer to our respective goals, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this point. ",960000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $965,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price and make it a win-win for both of us.",965000.0,Alice,9,
