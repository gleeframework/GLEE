"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're aiming to save as much as possible, and $120 is still too high.  Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to go down to $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$115 is a good price, especially considering you have a backup option at $150. You're saving $35 compared to John's offer."
