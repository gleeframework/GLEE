"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My initial offer is $1,150,000. This price reflects the product's exceptional qualities and allows for a substantial gain for you. I'm open to discussing your thoughts and potentially adjusting the price to find a solution we're both happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation, suggesting there's room for negotiation.
* You have a better alternative with John at $1,200,000. 
* It's worth attempting to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get the price lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately not viable for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is still higher than her own valuation, suggesting there's still potential for negotiation.
* While John offers a sure thing, there's a chance to get a better price from Alice.
* It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get the price lower."
