"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.  I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that, and I believe I can still get a better price from Bob through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal you won't regret."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm proposing a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, which can be helpful in reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,250?  I'm confident we can both be happy with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get a little bit more, $12,250 is a good price considering the potential for further negotiation. It's also above my minimum desired price of $12,000. There's a good chance that if I reject this offer, Bob will either lower his offer or walk away completely. Accepting this offer gives me a quick sale at a reasonable price."
