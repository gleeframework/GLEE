"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price point.  It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to buy the product but also wants to save money. This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by offering a lower price, but it's still within a reasonable range to potentially reach an agreement. It's important to show a willingness to compromise but also to establish a starting point lower than Bob's maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal you won't regret. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still above his target price. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his goal of $12,000. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,250?  I'm confident we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway while still staying within his budget. By offering $12,250, he's demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but also staying firm on his desire to keep the price below $12,500. This counteroffer shows a commitment to finding a compromise."
