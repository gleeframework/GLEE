Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and your budget constraints. While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it falls short of what the product is truly worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a considerable compromise. This price still allows me to gain a reasonable return on my investment, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.
