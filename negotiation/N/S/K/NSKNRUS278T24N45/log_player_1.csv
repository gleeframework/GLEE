"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and I know you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good profit. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to build a positive rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $7,500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as there's still potential to make a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need to get at least $8,200 for this product.  It's still a great deal for you, and I believe it's worth the extra investment.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $8,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable value. I'm happy to close the deal at this price, as it meets my goal.  It would be a waste of time to continue negotiating for a small gain, especially since I can always sell to John for the same price."
