"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your pricing, but I am currently working with a budget of $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $11,500?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still working within a tight budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
