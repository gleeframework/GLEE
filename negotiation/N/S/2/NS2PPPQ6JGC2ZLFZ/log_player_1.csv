"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to start by offering Bob a price that's a bit below his estimated value, but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate if he counters.  I'm also leaving some room to negotiate with John if Bob rejects my offer and I choose to sell to him instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my desired range, but it's still above my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round.  There's still room to negotiate, and I can always sell to John if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with a price that's still below Bob's estimated value, but closer to my desired price. This gives him a bit more room to negotiate, but hopefully, he'll see that my offer is fair.  I'm aiming to find a price where both of us can be happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not happy with it.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob, but I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with a price that's slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above Bob's last offer. This keeps the negotiation moving forward, but it also shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my desired range.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with him in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum, and we've already gone through five rounds of negotiation.  I'm not sure I can get him to budge any further, and I'm running out of time.  To avoid the risk of ending up with a lower price or no deal at all, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still better than risking a lower offer or a rejected offer from Bob."
