Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance to secure a deal with Bob before moving to John.

**Strategy**

The ideal strategy is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob but also maximizes your profit.  Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,350,000 is significantly higher than your minimum but still leaves Bob with a potential $150,000 gain.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""potential value"" and ""fair deal,"" you subtly anchor the price in a zone of mutual benefit.
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting Bob's ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a touch of urgency and importance. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher (e.g., $1,390,000) to leave room for a counter-offer. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly more generous price might be strategic.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially adjust your price if needed, but always keeping your $1,000,000 minimum in mind."
