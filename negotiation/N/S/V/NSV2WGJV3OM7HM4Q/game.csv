"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  Considering the substantial value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This price still allows for a good profit margin for me, while also making this a worthwhile investment for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",950000.0,Bob,4,
