"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that works for my budget. How about we try something around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $700,000? That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal if it works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about making a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
