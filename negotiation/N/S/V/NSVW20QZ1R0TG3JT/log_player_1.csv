Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that works for my budget. How about we try something around $600,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $700,000? That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal if it works for you.
