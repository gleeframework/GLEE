"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're offering.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  $18000 is a bit too low for me, as I value this product at significantly more.  How about we split the difference and settle on $21500? I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll receive from this product. Let me know your thoughts.",21500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you value the product highly, but $21500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18000 and $21500. How about we settle on $19750? I think this is a fair compromise.",19750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a compromise. While $19750 is closer, it's still below my minimum. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. I'm willing to come down to $20500. This feels like a good middle ground where we both get something out of this deal. What do you say?",20500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $20500. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle on $20250? I think this is a fair compromise and I'm willing to meet you in the middle one more time.",20250.0,Bob,6,
