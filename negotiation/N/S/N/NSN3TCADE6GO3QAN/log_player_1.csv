Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is above my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,000,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to facilitate a deal.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,300,000 is still a significant stretch for me.  I can offer you $700,000 to make this deal happen. I believe this is a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting $700,000 would be a substantial loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,500,000 offer."
