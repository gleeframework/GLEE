Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high (like $250) might scare Bob off immediately. $175 is a reasonable markup that might be enticing.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product is worth more than the asking price, potentially making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, we don't lose anything by trying to get a higher price from Bob."
