"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $1,400,000. How about we try $1,475,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not sure I can go much higher than this.",1475000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to go a bit further, but $1,475,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000 - that's my absolute lowest price.  If you're truly interested, let's finalize the deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
