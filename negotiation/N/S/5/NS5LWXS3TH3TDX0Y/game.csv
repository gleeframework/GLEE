"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a fair price considering I'm willing to buy it right away. Let's see if we can agree.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 just doesn't work for me. How about $105?  That's a significant drop from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $95? That's a good middle ground, and I'm ready to buy it now.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $100. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I hope we can agree on this.",100.0,Alice,7,
