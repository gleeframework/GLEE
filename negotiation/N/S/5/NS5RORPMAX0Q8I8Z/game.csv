"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but  $600,000 is a little steep for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $500,000? That feels like a fair deal to both of us.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $600,000 and $500,000. How about we try $550,000? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value.",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the compromise.  How about $525,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",525000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob! However, I'm still not quite comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $575,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",575000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but we're still a ways off. I'm willing to bump my offer to $535,000, but that's as high as I'm prepared to go.  Let me know if that works for you.",535000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay close to my target. How about we try $570,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",570000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting down to the wire. I'm willing to offer $550,000, but that's my absolute final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",550000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your urgency, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay close to my target. How about we try $565,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",565000.0,Alice,9,
