Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a significant profit margin for us while still being an attractive proposition for Bob, saving him $100,000 compared to its value to him.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning other buyers and framing the offer as time-limited, we encourage Bob to act quickly and consider the deal seriously."
