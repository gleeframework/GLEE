"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $100 is still quite a bit more than I'd like to spend."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation while still being a good deal for me if accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm completely happy with. I'll try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to go a bit higher. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We are aiming for a price below $80, but moving closer to it shows Alice we are willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $75, but I'm still hoping for something a little closer to $85.  Would you consider $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come up to our maximum price. There's no point in negotiating further since we can get the same price from John.  It's a fair deal, so we'll accept."
