Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $140. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $137? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.

While I could try to haggle Alice down a bit more, it's getting close to John's price. Accepting at $137 secures the product and still saves me some money."
