"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly trying to push the price higher by mentioning a ""true value"" of $15,000 which is irrelevant. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better price from Alice or resort to buying from John at the higher price."
