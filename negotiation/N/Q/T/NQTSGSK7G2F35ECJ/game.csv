"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential benefits for you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $825,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
