"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's still a great price for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'm going to have to consider other options.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $110, which is $112.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll love the product at this price.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not there yet. I'm going to stick with my offer of $110. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let's get this deal done!",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $112, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product at this price.",112.0,Alice,7,
