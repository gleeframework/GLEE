"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,850000.0
"Bob, I understand that $900,000 was a bit high for you, but $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we settle at $760,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.",760000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,810000.0
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $760,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $760,000, which is $792,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",792500.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $775,000.  That's a significant jump from my last offer, and I believe it reflects my seriousness about this purchase.",775000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,805000.0
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but I still believe the product is worth more to you than $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $792,500 and $775,000, which is $783,750. However, considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $805,000, which is the same price I offered in the last round. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",805000.0,Alice,7,,
