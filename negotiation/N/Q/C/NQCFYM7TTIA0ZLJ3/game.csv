"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $50?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $50 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $125 is still a bit high for my budget, could you do $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I understand you're working with a budget, but $70 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $100?  That would be a good price for both of us, I think. Let's see if we can make this happen.",100.0,Alice,5,
