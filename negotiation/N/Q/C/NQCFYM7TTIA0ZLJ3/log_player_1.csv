Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$175:** This is a starting point that's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the conversation. It highlights the potential value to him.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value ($150).  By starting high, I leave space to negotiate down while still earning a profit. I'm also hoping to encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his true interest and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.  If Bob isn't interested at this price, I can always fall back on John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $50 is far too low and completely unacceptable.  It's significantly less than my minimum value of $150. I need to reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $50 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$125:** This counteroffer is still above my minimum value ($150) but shows a willingness to negotiate. It's also closer to Bob's perceived value ($80).
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer and attempts to find a compromise. It emphasizes the willingness to negotiate and keeps the conversation friendly.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to bridge the gap between my minimum price and Bob's offer.  By offering a price that's closer to his initial counteroffer, I'm hoping to encourage him to engage further and potentially reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $125 is still a bit high for my budget, could you do $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's counteroffer of $70 is a bit closer to a reasonable price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a price that is so far below what the product is worth to me. I want to explore other options with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand you're working with a budget, but $70 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $100?  That would be a good price for both of us, I think. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100:**  This counteroffer is still above my minimum value but shows a clear willingness to compromise. It's also closer to Bob's last offer, suggesting a potential meeting point.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's budget constraints while emphasizing the fairness of the proposed price. It maintains a friendly tone and encourages further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping to push Bob closer to my desired price range. This offer is a significant compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to meet him halfway. If he rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $150, as the risk of further negotiation with Bob yielding a lower price is high."
