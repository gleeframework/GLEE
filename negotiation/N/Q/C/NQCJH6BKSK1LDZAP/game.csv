"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it for $1000000.  It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $800000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which still reflects the value of this unique product.  Let's find a middle ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. Can we meet in the middle at this price?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850000 is closer, it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875000, which is a fair compromise considering the unique value of this product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $875000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $860000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",860000.0,Bob,6,
