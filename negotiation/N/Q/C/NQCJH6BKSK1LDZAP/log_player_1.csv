Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is a fair compromise considering the unique value of this product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $875000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $860000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?
