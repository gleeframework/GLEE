"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the value of the product to both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you've placed on it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
