"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we start the negotiations at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is far too low.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of this product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum price.  Let's try $850,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This is my final offer, as I know I can buy the product elsewhere for this price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
