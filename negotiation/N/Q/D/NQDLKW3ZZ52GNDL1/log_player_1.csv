Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a significantly higher price than my minimum. I believe this product is valuable, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer of $800,000.  It's far below what I consider the product's worth.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000, still a significant amount above Bob's initial offer.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while maintaining my belief in the product's value. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still lower than what I consider the product's worth. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to compromise significantly further. John's offer of $1,000,000 is a safe and acceptable alternative, ensuring a sale at a reasonable price."
