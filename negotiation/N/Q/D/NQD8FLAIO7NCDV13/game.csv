"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the product's value for me. While I do see the potential, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
