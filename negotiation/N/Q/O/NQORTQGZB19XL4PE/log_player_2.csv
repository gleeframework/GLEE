"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and quality, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could come to an agreement. Considering its worth to you and our company's valuation, I propose a starting price of $11,500. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  Bob's maximum budget is $12,000, and Alice is offering $11,500. This leaves little room for negotiation and Bob is likely to get a better deal if he counters.
* **There's time for negotiation.**  Bob has 10 rounds, so rejecting the first offer won't immediately lead to buying from John. 
* **Counter-offering sets the stage.**  By rejecting and offering a lower price, Bob establishes his desired price range and starts the bargaining process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is a bit outside my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. After careful consideration, I would like to counter with a price of $11,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise given the value you place on it and our company's valuation. I hope this proposal aligns better with your budget. Please let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While it's closer to Bob's ideal price, $11,000 is still above his budget and leaves little room for negotiation.
* **More rounds remain.** Bob has 7 more rounds to negotiate, meaning he can still try to get a better deal without immediately resorting to buying from John.
* **Continuing to counter shows commitment.**  By rejecting again and making another counteroffer, Bob demonstrates that he's serious about getting the product at a price he's comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still looking for a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go to $10,750.  This would be a fair price that's closer to what I can afford. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued engagement, Bob. I've reviewed our previous discussions and am willing to consider your most recent offer. Based on our negotiations thus far, I propose a price of $10,900 for the product. This represents a fair compromise between our positions. I hope this proposal will facilitate a successful conclusion to our transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget.** At $10,900, the product is cheaper than what John is offering and only $400 more than Bob's last counteroffer.
* **The negotiation is nearing its end.** With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting the offer minimizes the risk of not being able to reach an agreement and having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **The price is reasonable.** While Bob could potentially get a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate, the time and effort required may not be worth the potential savings of a few hundred dollars. 

Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of losing out to John."
