"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I come down to $132.50?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $132.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $128.75?  I'm hoping we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",128.75,Bob,4,
