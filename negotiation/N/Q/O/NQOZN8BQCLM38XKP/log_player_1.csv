"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate while also showing I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I still believe I can get closer to my target price of $140. I'll reject this offer and counter with a slightly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I come down to $132.50?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price."", ""product_price"": 132.50} 
``` 
I'm offering a price in the middle of our last two offers. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $132.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $128.75?  I'm hoping we can reach a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $128.75 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price.  Accepting this offer secures a sale that is within a reasonable range of my desired price."
