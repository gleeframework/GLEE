Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I am proposing a price of $925,000. This is a chance to acquire an asset worth significantly more to you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's valuation) as possible while ensuring Bob accepts the offer.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob gains $75,000 in value ($1,000,000 - $925,000) if he accepts.
* **Safety Net:**  The offer is safely above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000 from John).

**Why this strategy is strong:**

* **Appeals to Bob's Interests:**  By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the significant value Bob gains, the offer encourages him to act quickly.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it allows for some negotiation downward if Bob counters.
* **Secures a Substantial Profit:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, the final price is likely to be very favorable to you."
