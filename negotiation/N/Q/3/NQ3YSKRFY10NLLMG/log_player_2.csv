"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I am proposing a price of $925,000. This is a chance to acquire an asset worth significantly more to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. Rejecting this offer gives you a chance to secure a better price, either from Alice in a counter-offer or by accepting John's offer."
