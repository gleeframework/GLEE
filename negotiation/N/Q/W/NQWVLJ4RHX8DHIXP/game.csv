"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to where I need to be.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?  This way, we both get closer to what we're looking for.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really want to make this work, but I can't go any lower than $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
