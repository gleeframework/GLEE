"I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $12,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,4,
