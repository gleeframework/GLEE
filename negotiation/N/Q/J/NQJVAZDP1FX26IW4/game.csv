"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $800000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $700000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $650000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $650000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $675000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
