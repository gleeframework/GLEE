"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $1,125,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.  How about we consider $1,687,500?",1687500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, and I want to make a deal happen.  $1,350,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle at $1,537,500? That's a significant movement on my part.",1537500.0,Alice,5,
