Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting very close to John's offer, but Bob is consistently increasing his offers and we still have time. It's worth risking another counter-offer to try and secure a slightly better deal than $1,500,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this purchase, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To meet you in the middle, I'm willing to accept $1,475,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1475000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**
* **Time Constraint:**  We are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. 
* **Profit Margin:**  $1,475,000 is a good profit margin, significantly above our minimum. 
* **Firmness:** By stating this is our final offer, we add a bit of pressure without being too aggressive.  

This offer gives Bob a chance to meet us close to the middle ground and avoid the risk of losing the deal by pushing for a price too close to John's offer."
