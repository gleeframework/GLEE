"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price! I'm willing to let you have it for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice wants to sell the product for as much profit as possible. Her starting price of $12,000 is significantly higher than her own valuation ($8,000).
* **Your Advantage:** You know you have a backup option with John at $15,000.  This means there's room for negotiation with Alice. 
* **Strategy:** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. She might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale entirely."
