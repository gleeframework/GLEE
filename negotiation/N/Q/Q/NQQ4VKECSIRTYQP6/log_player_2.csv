{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. You'll need to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $18,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Could you meet me halfway at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down from her initial price, $14,000 is still above your maximum budget. You want to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  However,  $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle this at $12,500? This is a fair price considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  At this point, it's better to go with John's offer and save $2,500.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will get Alice to your desired price point within the remaining rounds."
