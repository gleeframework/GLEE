"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine,  $47.50?",47.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $47.50. I'm willing to offer you a compromise at $52.50. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",52.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm finding it hard to justify going above $50. How about we meet in the middle at $50 even? That's a fair compromise.",50.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $50. I'm willing to offer you a slight concession at $53. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",53.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is getting a bit frustrating.  I'm willing to be fair, but $53 is pushing it. My absolute last offer is $51. If you can't accept that, I'll unfortunately have to go with John.",51.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're trying to make a final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $51. I'm willing to make one more concession at $54. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",54.0,Alice,9,
