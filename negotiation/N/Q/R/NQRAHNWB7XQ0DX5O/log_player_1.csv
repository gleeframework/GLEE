Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob of its worth without directly revealing your minimum price.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While you have John as a backup, it's best to secure a deal with Bob first, potentially at a higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests you're open to discussing the price further, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer."
