"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $1,000,000 from Alice, as you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000. It's always better to try and negotiate further and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price and is a good starting point for negotiation. It's a strong opening move that demonstrates your interest in buying the product while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than the $750,000 counteroffer you made. You can likely negotiate further and get a better price from Alice. It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer of $750,000 and Alice's current offer of $900,000. It shows that you are willing to meet Alice halfway, while still trying to secure a lower price."
