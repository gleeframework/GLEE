"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below my asking price. This product is truly valuable, and I believe $14,000 is a fair compromise. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can get good use out of the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
