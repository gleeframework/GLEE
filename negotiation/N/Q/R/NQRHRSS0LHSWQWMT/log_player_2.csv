"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm not quite ready to commit to that price.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob can potentially save more money by continuing to negotiate.  It's worth exploring if Alice will come down further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm still interested, $1,225,000 is unfortunately still a bit too high for me.  Could we aim for a price closer to $1,100,000?  That's the absolute maximum I can go."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints. Let's make this work. How about $1,175,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still $175,000 higher than Bob's maximum budget.  While there is a chance Bob could negotiate further, there's also a risk of Alice refusing and Bob ending up with nothing.  Since John is offering the product for Bob's maximum budget, it's the safer and more financially sound option to buy from John."
