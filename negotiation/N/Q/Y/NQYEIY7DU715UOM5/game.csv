"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves some room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is a bit higher than your offer, but still a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",9500.0,Alice,5,
