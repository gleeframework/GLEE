"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is above my minimum. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $110?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $110 is below my minimum, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130? That would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $120, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While I would love to keep negotiating and see if I can get a little bit more, Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum.  Since I can sell to John for the same price, there is no risk to me in accepting Bob's offer."
