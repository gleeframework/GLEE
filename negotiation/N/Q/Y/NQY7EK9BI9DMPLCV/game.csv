"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $97?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $97 is a good compromise, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet in the middle. How about we settle at $102? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
