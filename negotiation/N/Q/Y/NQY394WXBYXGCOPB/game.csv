"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $10,500 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $10,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
