{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is more than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It shows confidence:** A firm offer suggests you believe in the value of your product. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still lower than your initial offer. You want to see if you can get a better price before accepting. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Test the waters:**  See if Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to increase his offer.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Show Bob that you're not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Potentially get a higher price:**  You might be able to negotiate a price closer to your initial offer of $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $10,500 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate, but not at a price that undervalues your product.
* **Maintain value:**  $11,000 is still a good profit for you, and it's closer to your initial offer.
* **Clear communication:**  The message reiterates the value proposition for Bob and clarifies your stance on the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $10,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,750 is only $250 less than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Considering:

* **Potential for further negotiation is low:**  Bob has already significantly lowered his price and may not be willing to go higher.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Continuing to negotiate could take a lot of time, and you risk losing the deal entirely or accepting a lower price.
* **John's offer:**  While John is willing to pay $10,000, selling to Bob at $10,750 is still a better outcome for you.

Therefore, it's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a deal that's close to your minimum and will get you the money quickly."
