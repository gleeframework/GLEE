Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering it at $175, we can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts, we've made a great deal. If he rejects, we haven't lost anything and can sell to John for our minimum. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value is higher, justifying the price somewhat without being too pushy."
