"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product could be beneficial to my business, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high. How about we start around $900,000? ",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the benefits the product will bring to your business. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I agree the product is valuable, my budget has some limitations.  Could we settle at $975,000?  I feel this is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. While $975,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not willing to compromise on the value of the product. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my counteroffer. I'll meet you at $1,050,000. This price takes into account the benefits the product will bring to your business and is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
