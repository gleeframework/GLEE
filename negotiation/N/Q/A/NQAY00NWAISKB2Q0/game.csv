"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $2500000. This is a fair price considering its rarity and potential benefits. What do you think?",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2500000 is far more than I'm willing to pay. Given my budget and the potential value of this product, I'd be willing to offer $800000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. ",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. Considering the product's rarity and potential value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still outside my budget.  I understand the value of this product, but my maximum is $800000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. ",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1100000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to know if you're willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
