"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let's work together to close this deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm firm on my offer of $8,500.  If that works for you, we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. However, I'm still not comfortable with $8,500. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's reach an agreement now, so we can both move on.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and it will allow us to both walk away happy. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you getting closer to my price, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Let's close this deal now to avoid any further negotiation.",9000.0,Alice,7,
