Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and Bob's offer is significantly lower. It's not worth selling at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm firm on my offer of $8,500.  If that works for you, we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still holding out for a higher price.  $8,500 is too far below her minimum threshold, and she's better off continuing to negotiate or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, I'm still not comfortable with $8,500. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's reach an agreement now, so we can both move on."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and it will allow us to both walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is still determined to get closer to her desired price.  While $8,750 is closer than before, it's still too far below her minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting closer to my price, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Let's close this deal now to avoid any further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 9000}
