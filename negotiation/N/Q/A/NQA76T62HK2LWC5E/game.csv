"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work. This still gives you a significant discount, and it's a price that I can reasonably accept. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $7,000? I'm eager to make a deal and avoid having to explore other options.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,000 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal happen. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
