"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low.  I'll reject and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work. This still gives you a significant discount, and it's a price that I can reasonably accept. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $7,000? I'm eager to make a deal and avoid having to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly lower than what I need."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,000 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal happen. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
