"Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, but I'm open to discussing it further.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm not able to go down to $850,000, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's closer to your offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value we both see in this transaction.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer!  While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to gain something from this deal.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a middle ground.  Let's try $925,000.  It's a good compromise that allows us to both reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,
