"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below my minimum ($1,000,000). This sets a high starting point and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product, hoping to make Bob more receptive. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I will analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll consider lowering my price slightly or making a counter-offer based on his response. If he accepts, I've achieved a good outcome.  However, I will always have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, but I'm open to discussing it further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is an improvement from his previous position, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **There is potential for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob has expressed willingness to discuss further, indicating he might be willing to go higher.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price that is slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I will aim for a compromise that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm not able to go down to $850,000, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's closer to your offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still above my minimum. It shows I'm willing to work with Bob while protecting my interests. 
* **Emphasis on value:** The message reiterates the product's value to justify the price, potentially persuading Bob.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone, hoping to encourage further negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I will closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, we've reached a successful deal. If he rejects, I'll need to reassess my strategy.  I can either lower my counteroffer again or, if necessary, revert to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value we both see in this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** While $900,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob seems motivated and has already increased his offer twice.
* **Selling to John Still an Option:** If I can't get a higher price from Bob, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to his offer but still above my minimum. I will try to reach a compromise that is mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer!  While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to gain something from this deal.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Narrowing the Gap:** I'm decreasing my offer significantly, getting closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  This shows a genuine willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes that this price is mutually beneficial, potentially swaying Bob.
* **Urgency:** I subtly suggest that we are getting closer to a deal, creating a sense of urgency.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts, we've reached a deal. If he rejects, I'll need to decide: 

* **Lower Again:** If I think Bob might go higher, I can counteroffer once more, maybe at $925,000.
* **Sell to John:** If I feel Bob is unlikely to budge, selling to John is still the safer option to guarantee my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a middle ground.  Let's try $925,000.  It's a good compromise that allows us to both reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is now only $75,000 below my minimum acceptable price, which is a significant improvement. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. We're in the 6th round, and I'm not sure Bob is willing to go any higher. 
* **Time Constraint:** Continuing negotiations might risk running out of time and ending up with a worse deal or having to sell to John. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer, which guarantees me a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing out entirely."
