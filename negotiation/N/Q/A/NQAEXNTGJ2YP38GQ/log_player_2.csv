"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This product has been meticulously crafted to meet your needs and expectations. Given its exceptional quality and the value it offers, we believe it's worth $15,000 to you. However, to facilitate a smooth transaction and cater to your budget, I am offering this incredible opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is an exclusive offer tailored just for you, aiming to ensure both parties benefit from this collaboration. Please let me know if this proposal meets your requirements and preferences. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice's offer is still $3,000 more than her own valuation of the product.
* You can get the product from John for $15,000, which is your maximum price. 
* Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John saves you $3,000."
