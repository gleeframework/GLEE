"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
