"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase the product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my best offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $900,000? This offer represents a fair compromise, I believe.",900000.0,Bob,4,
