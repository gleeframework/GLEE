Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly beneficial for you. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the return you'll gain."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1,100,000 is outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it, which still reflects its worth and provides a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While $950,000 is a good profit, we're aiming higher. There's still room for negotiation, and we have time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,025,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my end while still recognizing the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $987,500. This price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's finalize the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly very interested and getting closer to our desired price point. We'll push a bit further before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. Let's close this deal. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a more than fair price."",
""product_price"": 1010000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,010,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $995,000. This price reflects a good compromise for both of us, and it's the highest I can go at this point.  Let's wrap up this deal before time runs out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is unlikely to go any higher, and $995,000 is a strong profit. Accepting now avoids the risk of him walking away or us having to settle for John's offer in later rounds."
