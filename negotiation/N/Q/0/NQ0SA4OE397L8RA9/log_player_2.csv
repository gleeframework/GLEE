# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is within my budget and a significant discount from her initial price. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that she'll push back further and we won't reach an agreement. Accepting this offer saves me a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John, and I'm confident I've secured a good deal."
