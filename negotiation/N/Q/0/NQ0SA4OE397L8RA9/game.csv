"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000.

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
