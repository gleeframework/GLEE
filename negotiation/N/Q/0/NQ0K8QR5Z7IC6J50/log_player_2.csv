"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value and can greatly benefit you. I'm initially offering it at $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $650,000?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While I'm willing to spend up to $800,000, I want to start significantly lower to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Respectful Tone:**  I maintain a polite and interested tone to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** My offer is low enough that Alice is likely to counter, giving us space to hopefully meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product offers is substantial.  I could come down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved down a bit, $925,000 is still significantly more than I want to pay and well above John's price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still space between our offers, suggesting we can negotiate further to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $725,000? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting the product's value and my financial constraints."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** I raised my offer considerably to show Alice I'm serious about purchasing the product.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is closer to my maximum budget ($800,000) but still leaves me some room to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  I've provided a reason for my offer (""financial constraints"") while reiterating my belief in the product's value. 
* **Encouraging Agreement:** By framing the offer as ""fair,"" I'm hoping to encourage Alice to accept or at least move closer to my price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your budget considerations. Let's find a middle ground. How about $850,000? This demonstrates my willingness to reach a deal while ensuring the product's value is recognized. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:**  Alice is getting closer to my range, but $850,000 is still above my ideal price and what John offers.
* **Negotiating Power:** I have time and the fallback option of John, which gives me some power to push for a better deal.
* **Testing the Waters:** I want to see if Alice is willing to go lower, especially since I made a significant jump in my previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're clearly motivated to sell, and I do want to make this work.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding my ground at my maximum price, signaling that this is my limit. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel like a win-win to both parties.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, so I want to apply a bit of time pressure.
* **John as Leverage:** Alice knows I have the option to go to John, which makes this offer even more appealing."
