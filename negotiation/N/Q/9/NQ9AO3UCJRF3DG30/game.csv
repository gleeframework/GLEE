"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $13,000.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $13,000.  If you're willing to come down to $12,000, we can finalize the deal.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to take the product off your hands.",12000.0,Bob,6,
