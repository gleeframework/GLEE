"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's not even close to the product's worth of $12,000 to Alice. It's better to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still a bit above your budget.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can reach an agreement. You're getting closer, and you have some leverage since John is offering the product for $8,000."
