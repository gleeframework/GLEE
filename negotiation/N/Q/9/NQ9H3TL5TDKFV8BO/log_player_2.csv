"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great price considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  He's willing to pay up to $12,000, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $9,500 is still a good deal for him, saving him $2,500 compared to buying from John. While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will walk away or he'll end up paying closer to John's price."
