Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. I'm getting closer to being willing to sell, but I still need to make a profit. Let's try to meet in the middle again. How about $10,750?

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,750. You've been consistently raising your offer, and she's meeting you halfway but holding firm to a price above your guaranteed option. It's better to cut your losses and secure the product from John at $10,000."
