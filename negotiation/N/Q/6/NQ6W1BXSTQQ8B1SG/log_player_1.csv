Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth $1,000,000 in the right hands.  I'm willing to part with it for $925,000.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer, as I have another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Time Sensitivity:** I introduce a sense of urgency by mentioning another buyer (John). While John is my backup, Bob doesn't need to know that. 
* **Single Offer:**  By making it a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" offer, I encourage a quicker decision and avoid potentially lengthy negotiations.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism."
