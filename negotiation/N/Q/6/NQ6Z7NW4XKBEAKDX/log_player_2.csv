"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go below $10,000. I think this is the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. How about we meet in the middle at $10,100? This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly signaling that $10,000 is her absolute bottom line.  Continuing to negotiate risks her walking away from the deal. Accepting $10,100 secures a significant saving compared to John's $12,000 price."
