Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it has great value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a relatively high price ($15,000) to see if Bob is genuinely interested and has a high perceived value for the product.
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the unique value and potential of the product to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies openness to negotiation, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer if he finds the price too high.
* **Plan B:** Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000, I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's offers are unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $14000? I believe this would still provide a good value for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is close to my starting price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob's message indicates flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This suggests there's room to push for a higher price.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still looking to get closer to my initial asking price.  How about we settle on $14,500?  This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial price and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my earnings.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price point.
* **Open to Finality:** My message implies that this might be my final offer, encouraging Bob to seriously consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $14000 for the product? This would allow me to purchase it without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Persistence:** Bob has stuck to his $14,000 offer, indicating that it's likely his final offer.
* **Minimum Value:** While $14,000 is lower than my initial desired price, it's still above my minimum threshold of $10,000.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk him walking away entirely, leaving me with the lower offer from John.
* **Time Factor:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and potentially lead to a lower price, which is not ideal.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a reasonable profit.  It's a strategic decision to secure the deal without risking a lower price from John or a prolonged negotiation."
