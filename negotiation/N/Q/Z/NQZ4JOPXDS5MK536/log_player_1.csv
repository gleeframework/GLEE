"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm asking for $110, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, but leaving room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build a positive relationship with Bob by being open to his ideas."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves me with some profit.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have 6 rounds left and I believe I can get a better offer. I want to see if I can nudge Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm open to finding a compromise! How about we split the difference and go with $96?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 96}
``` 
 
I'm trying to be flexible by suggesting a compromise, which might make Bob more likely to accept. $96 is still a decent profit for me, and we're getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $94. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $94
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting.  While $94 is below my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to accept this offer to secure a sale."
