{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you. "", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as much money as possible. While she has a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $1,150,000 is strategically chosen:
    * **Above Bob's Value:** It's higher than what Bob values the product at ($1,000,000), giving Alice room for negotiation.
    * **Below John's Offer:** It's still lower than what John is willing to pay, ensuring Alice a profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:** Highlighting the ""exclusivity"" adds a touch of urgency and might make Bob more amenable to the price.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Alice earns $1,150,000, which is $50,000 more than Bob's initial valuation.
* **Bob Negotiates:** Alice has room to lower the price slightly while still remaining above her minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** Alice sells to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
