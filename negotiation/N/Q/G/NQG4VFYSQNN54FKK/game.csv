"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I'd need a much lower price. How about $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the value it brings while still offering a fair deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate you coming down, $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I see that we are making progress.  To be frank, I have a hard limit at $1,000,000.  If you are willing to come down to this price I will buy it today.  Otherwise, I will have to consider purchasing from John.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I consider a fair deal.  To be transparent, I have another buyer ready to purchase at a higher price. However, I believe in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. If you're willing to meet me in the middle at $1,500,000, we have a deal. This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
