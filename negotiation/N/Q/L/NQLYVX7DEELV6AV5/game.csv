"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am not able to meet the price of $2000000. Would you consider reducing the price? I am willing to pay up to $1500000.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1500000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above my minimum.  I'm willing to accept $1750000.  This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I am still unable to meet the price of $1750000. I am willing to pay up to $1600000 for the product. I hope this meets closer to your expectations.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
