"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still not convinced that $850000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm making a counteroffer of $775000. I think this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,

This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $825000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $795000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that balances the product's value with my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle soon.",795000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $795000.

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm starting to get close to my budget limit, and I'm not sure how much further I can go. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $795000. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1200000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement, but I need to be realistic about my budget.",795000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to budge from my previous offer of $815000.
