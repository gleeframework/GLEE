"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can we meet in the middle?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $800000 is significantly below my starting point, I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's find common ground here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1600000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your position, but $1200000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1400000 as a final compromise.  This price reflects the product's true value and  allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. I'm confident this is a fair offer,  and I'd be disappointed to see this opportunity slip away.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1200000. This is my last offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
