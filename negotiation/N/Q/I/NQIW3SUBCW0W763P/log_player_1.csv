Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and still being attractive to Bob. Here's why:

* **My Profit:**  I'm offering the product for $10,000, earning $2,000 more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000.  My offer gives him a $2,000 savings, making it a good deal for him. 

By offering a price in the middle, I increase the chances that Bob accepts, while still getting a good price for the product. If he rejects, I can sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
