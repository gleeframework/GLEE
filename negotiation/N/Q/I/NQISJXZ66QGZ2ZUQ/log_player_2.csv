"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $120, but $95 is still a significant cost. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better price.

**Next Steps:** You'll need to make a counteroffer in the next round. Try to find a price that's fair to both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering $85, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $95. This shows I'm serious about negotiating.
* **Fair compromise:**  This price is still higher than Alice's value of $80, giving her some profit, while also being within my acceptable range.
* **Room for negotiation:**  We have several rounds left, so there's room to adjust the price if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While slightly lower than her initial offer, $100 is still more than I want to pay. 
* **We have time to negotiate.**  I have several rounds left, and I can continue to counter-offer and try to get a price closer to my target.

**Next Steps:** I will need to make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my acceptable range of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint approach:**  This offer is a midpoint between my previous offer of $85 and Alice's current offer of $100. It shows I'm willing to compromise but also still negotiating for a better price.
* **Staying within my budget:**  $90 is still within my acceptable range of $120, so I'm not overspending. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to see if Alice is willing to come down further. If she rejects, I can make a slightly lower counteroffer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While lower than her previous offer, $105 is still outside of my ideal range. 
* **Time is on my side.** I have five rounds remaining, and there is still room for negotiation. I can try to get a better price with a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round.  I will aim for a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase:**  My previous offer of $90 was rejected, so I'm increasing it slightly to $92. This shows I'm willing to move, but not too far.
* **Staying within my budget:**  $92 is still well within my acceptable range of $120.
* **Testing for compromise:**  This offer could be seen as a compromise by Alice. If she rejects, I can lower it slightly in the next round.

**Next Steps:**  I will continue to monitor Alice's responses and adjust my counteroffers accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** $110 is significantly more than my ideal price. 
* **Time is running out, but I can still negotiate.**  We only have three rounds left, but I can still try to get a better price with a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is a fallback.** While John's offer is more expensive, I can use it as a benchmark to gauge how much I'm willing to pay.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $95.  If Alice keeps rejecting, I will have to seriously consider buying from John in the final round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 97}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:**  Alice's last offer was $110, and I'm offering $97, significantly narrowing the gap.
* **Almost within my range:** $97 is close to my acceptable price range, but leaves some room for Alice to profit.
* **High stakes:** We only have two rounds left, so I need to show Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal.

**Next Steps:** I'll need to be prepared to either accept Alice's next offer or buy from John if it's too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** $115 is still outside my acceptable range, and we only have one round left.
* **No time for further negotiation.**  There's not enough time to get a better price from Alice. 
* **John's offer is a safe bet.**  While John's offer is more expensive than my ideal price, it's still within my budget and guarantees I'll get the product.

**Next Steps:** It's best to avoid the risk of a final round with Alice and secure the product from John."
