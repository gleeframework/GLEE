"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $12000.  This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain from this unique item. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $9500, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
