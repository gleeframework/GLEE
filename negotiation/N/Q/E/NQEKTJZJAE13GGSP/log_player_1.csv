"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I'm aiming for a higher price. Bob clearly values the product and is willing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  This price still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $10750 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,750 is closer to my target price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, trying to secure a price closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see you're committed to getting a good deal.  Let's meet in the middle one more time. How about $10,900? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10700 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price, I've reached the point where I need to consider the opportunity cost. Bob's offer is only $200 less than my last counteroffer, and continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of him rejecting further offers or me losing the deal entirely. Selling to John would only yield $10,000, which is significantly less than Bob's offer. Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale for $10,700."
