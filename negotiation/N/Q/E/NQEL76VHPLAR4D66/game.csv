"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9250? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and still allows for some room for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9250 is still above my budget.  How about we split the difference again and go with $8875?  It's a fair price that's closer to your asking price and within my range.",8875.0,Bob,4,
