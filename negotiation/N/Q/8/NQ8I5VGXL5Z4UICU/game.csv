"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $90. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as high as $75, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $85. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",85.0,Alice,5,
