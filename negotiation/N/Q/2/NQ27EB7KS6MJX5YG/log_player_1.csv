Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good price. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but also setting a strong initial point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe the product is worth more than $15,000. I want to see if I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, hoping to find a middle ground. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a price that undervalues the product for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still lower than my initial asking price, it's a good compromise and I'm happy to secure a sale for $16,000, especially given John's offer of only $15,000."
