"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900000. I'm willing to come down to $950000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe the product is worth it to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $920000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to be careful with my finances.",920000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $930000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",930000.0,Alice,5,
