"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal, it's still above Alice's valuation of $800,000. This indicates there's potential for further negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and attempt to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts by splitting the difference between Alice's valuation ($800,000) and the previous offer ($950,000). This shows a willingness to negotiate but also establishes a firm stance.  Bob aims to get a price closer to Alice's valuation, knowing that a lower price benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $975,000 is closer to her initial offer than Bob's.  While this is still better than buying from John, there is room for negotiation.  Bob should continue trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a middle ground.  This counteroffer is  $75,000 lower than Alice's last offer and $50,000 higher than Bob's previous offer. This shows continued negotiation, and keeps the possibility of a deal open.  It also provides a solid starting point for the next round of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $990,000 is getting very close to Bob's maximum price.  While there is still a small difference, the potential for significant gains from further negotiation is shrinking.  At this point, the risk of not getting the product from Alice and being forced to buy from John at a much higher price is too high.  It's better to secure the product now, even at a slightly higher price, than risk losing the deal altogether."
