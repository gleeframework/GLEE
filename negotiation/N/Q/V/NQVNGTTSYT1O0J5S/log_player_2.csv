"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $6,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $6,500 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $6,500 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $5,500 for it. This represents a significant discount and would allow me to comfortably purchase it within my budget."", ""product_price"": 5500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $5,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $6,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my ideal price point.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price of $5,500.  I believe there's still room for compromise, and I don't want to settle for a price that's not ideal for me, especially since I have a limited number of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I understand your position, $6,000 is still slightly higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $5,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 5750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $5,900. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $5,900, which is closer to my target price of $5,500. While I would love to get it even lower, there's a risk that if I reject this offer and make another counteroffer, Alice might get frustrated and walk away.  I don't want to lose this opportunity, and this price is still a good deal compared to John's offer of $8,000."
