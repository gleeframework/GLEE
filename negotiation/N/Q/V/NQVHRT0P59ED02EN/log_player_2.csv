{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer at this point, as John is offering the same price. 
* Rejecting allows Bob to potentially get a better deal from Alice. 
* It's too early to buy from John since we have 10 rounds to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:** Starting with a lower price forces Alice to reveal her bottom line quickly. 
* **Significant Discount:**  A $200,000 discount is substantial and shows Bob is serious about negotiating. 
* **Room for Compromise:** This offer still allows for a good deal for Alice, making her more likely to counter."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  There's potential for a better deal.
* **Maintain Pressure:** Rejecting keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  It's too early to buy from John, as more negotiation rounds remain. There's a good chance Bob can get a better price from Alice."

Round 4

* **Strategic Positioning:** It allows Bob to potentially secure a price closer to his initial offer in the next round."
