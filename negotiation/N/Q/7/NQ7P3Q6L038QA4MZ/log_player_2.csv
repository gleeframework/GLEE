"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe it's also a great value for the price. Let's make this transaction happen. How about we start at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can likely get a better deal. Since you value the product at $120, you have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm looking to spend closer to $105.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  It also shows that you are serious about buying the product but are looking for a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to push for a lower price in the next round.  Remember, your goal is to save as much money as possible, and rejecting allows you to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle of our last offers at $108.75.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow us to finalize the transaction."", ""product_price"": 108.75}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your last offer of $105 and Alice's offer of $112.50. It shows you're willing to meet her halfway while still trying to get a better price.  This approach demonstrates your commitment to closing the deal while remaining within your budget."
