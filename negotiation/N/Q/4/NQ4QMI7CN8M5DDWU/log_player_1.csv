{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it still leaves a good profit margin for me.  I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,500. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. I'm hoping Bob will meet me halfway to secure a deal that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept a price that significantly undervalues the product. John is offering my desired price, so I'll take the secure deal with him."
