"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1200000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1150000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1150000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a fair price considering the potential savings I'm offering you compared to selling to John.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1125000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
