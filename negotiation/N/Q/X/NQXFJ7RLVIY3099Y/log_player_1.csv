Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer gives Bob a significant discount from the $1,200,000 John is offering, making it potentially attractive to him. It also provides a healthy profit margin for you, exceeding your minimum requirement of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it is closer to my desired price, I want to see if I can squeeze out a slightly better deal.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

I'm going to stick with a counteroffer that is still significantly higher than what Bob offered, but a bit lower than my initial offer. This might encourage him to accept, as it shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell below my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it still falls below what I'm willing to accept.  It's getting increasingly risky to continue negotiating with him, as his offers are getting progressively lower.  Selling to John at this moment guarantees me a profit that meets my minimum requirement.  Therefore, I'll sell to John and avoid any further negotiation risks."
