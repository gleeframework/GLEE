,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $95? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $90 at this point. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $102.50. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for the value this product provides.",102.5,Alice,5,
