"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is better than Alice's initial value of $120, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering.  He's also keeping the option of buying from John for $80 open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $95? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. He is also expressing his willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable price. This approach is likely to lead to further negotiation and hopefully a price closer to his desired $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, Bob is still determined to get the product for as close to his $80 limit as possible.  He's willing to continue negotiating with Alice, aiming for a lower price. He still has the option of buying from John if the negotiation doesn't go his way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $90 at this point. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, but he's making a smaller decrease in price this time. He's trying to signal that he's serious about buying the product but is still pushing for a better price.  He's also trying to set the stage for a potential compromise in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $102.50. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for the value this product provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price again, $102.50 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  At this point, the negotiation is getting close to the end and further haggling may not get him the desired price.  Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $80, it's the best option at this stage.  It's a guaranteed price within his budget and allows him to avoid further negotiation."
