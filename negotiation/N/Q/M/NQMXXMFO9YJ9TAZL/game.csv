"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $105 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $97?",97.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $97. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we compromise at $102? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.",102.0,Alice,5,
