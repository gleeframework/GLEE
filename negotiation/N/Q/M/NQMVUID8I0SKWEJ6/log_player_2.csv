"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $1,500,000 is above his budget, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential for your business. I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $1,350,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a better price. It's possible Alice might be willing to come down further, especially if she's motivated to make a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  I'm sure you understand that this product is important to me, but I'm working with a tight budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
