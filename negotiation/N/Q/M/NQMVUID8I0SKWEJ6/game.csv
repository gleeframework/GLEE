"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential for your business. I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  I'm sure you understand that this product is important to me, but I'm working with a tight budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
