Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500, and I'm starting to think that's too low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $13,000. This is my last offer, and I expect you to accept it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  

Alice seems very firm on her price and is unlikely to go below $13,000. While she claims this is her ""final offer"" multiple times, her actions show she's willing to negotiate but at a very slow pace.  

It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000. Taking this route saves you at least $3,000 and avoids further haggling."
