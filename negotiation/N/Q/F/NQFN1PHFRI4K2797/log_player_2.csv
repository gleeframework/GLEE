"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than John's $15,000, you know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, indicating there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you know Alice values the product at $10,000, offering $11,000 is a reasonable starting point for your counteroffer. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing you're serious about negotiating, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You can likely get a lower price by continuing to negotiate.  While $13,000 is better than John's price, you're still better off pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer shows she's willing to negotiate, but still wants a higher price.  Offering $11,500 is a compromise between your previous offer and hers. It shows you're willing to meet halfway while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is better than John's price, you're still within your budget and can likely get a lower price by continuing to negotiate. Alice is still willing to negotiate, and you've shown that you're serious about getting a good deal.  Continuing to counteroffer will likely lead to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've successfully gotten Alice to lower her price each round, but she's still stubborn. Offering $12,000 is another compromise, meeting her halfway again.  This shows you're serious about closing the deal, but also demonstrates you're not willing to overpay. If she rejects this, you're nearing John's price, making it a risky move for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is becoming less flexible. She's raising her offer, suggesting she's unwilling to budge much further. At this point, you're nearing your maximum budget with John's offer, and continuing to negotiate could risk Alice getting closer to John's price, potentially leading to a worse deal. 

It's time to cut your losses and accept the safer option.  While it's not the ideal price, it's still within your budget and guarantees you get the product."
