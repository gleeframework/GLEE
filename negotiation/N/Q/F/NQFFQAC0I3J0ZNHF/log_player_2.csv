Alice's offer is way too high. I'm not going to pay more than $10,000 for this product. I'll try to negotiate with Alice first, but if she's not reasonable, I'll just buy from John."

Round 3

# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've done some research and I believe the product's value is higher than you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13,000?

I'm getting tired of this back and forth with Alice.  We're not that far apart, but I'm not going to spend any more time on it.  I'll just buy from John and be done with it."
