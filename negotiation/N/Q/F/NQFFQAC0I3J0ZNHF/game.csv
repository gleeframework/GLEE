"Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product, but $14,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've done some research and I believe the product's value is higher than you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price. Let's not waste any more time.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're being firm on your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're making an effort to compromise, but $11,500 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to take my business elsewhere.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $10,500, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,7,
