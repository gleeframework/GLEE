Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're already making a significant profit at $950,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still increase the price if Bob counteroffers.
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:**  This approach is more likely to lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to you.  Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer allows you to:

* **Maintain your leverage:** You haven't lost anything by rejecting his offer, and you can potentially get a better price.
* **Negotiate further:**  You can attempt to bridge the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

You will now need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider a price that's still higher than your minimum but lower than your original offer.  This shows flexibility while still trying to get a good price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $750,000 is too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still making a profit.
* **Focus on value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Clear price:** A specific price is provided to keep the negotiation focused and avoid unnecessary back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is your minimum acceptable price, but it's the same price that John is offering. Since there's no further upside to negotiating with Bob, it's more efficient to sell to John immediately. This eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially breaking down and ending up with a worse outcome."
