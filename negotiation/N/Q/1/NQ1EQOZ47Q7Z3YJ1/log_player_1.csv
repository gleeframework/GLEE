"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, he may be willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll have more information about his willingness to pay and can adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. It's still early in the process and I don't want to settle too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $17,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  I'm hopeful that this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit below my initial goal, it's a good deal considering the time we've spent negotiating.  We're approaching the halfway point and I want to avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether.  $16,500 is a decent profit and I'm happy to close the deal."
