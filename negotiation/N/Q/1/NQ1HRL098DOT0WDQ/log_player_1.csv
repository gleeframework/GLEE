"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe there's still potential for a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, showing some flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer. This should encourage Bob to counter again, hopefully moving closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $200 less than my minimum acceptable price, and we're already in round 4.  I'm not confident I can get him to budge much more, and I don't want to risk running out of time.  It's best to take this offer and secure the sale."
