"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, as it's worth $10,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell it for that right away. I still believe there's potential to get a higher price, especially since Bob clearly sees the value in the product. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. It's a good middle ground and hopefully, Bob will see the value in accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a significant improvement from his last offer and is closer to my ideal price.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by being too stubborn.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer ensures I secure a sale and get a decent profit."
