"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you, so I think this is a fair price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's $15,000 offer, there's room for negotiation. Bob can likely get the price down further, potentially saving a significant amount of money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore better prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in this product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal. However, it's still above Alice's minimum selling point, leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point, and $11,000 is still a significant savings compared to John's offer. Accepting the offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a stalemate or Alice rejecting a lower counteroffer."
