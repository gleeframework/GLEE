"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,000. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  That seems like a fair compromise.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and go with $8,875. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",8875.0,Alice,5,
