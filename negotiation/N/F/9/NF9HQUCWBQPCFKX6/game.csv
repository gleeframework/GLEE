"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm happy to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $100 is still outside my budget. I'm really keen on this product, but I'm only able to offer $85. This would be a great deal for both of us, as I'd be happy to buy it at that price, and it's still a good amount for you. Let me know what you think!",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $85 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $95. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,5,
