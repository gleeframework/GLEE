You have three options:

You should reject Alice's offer.  It's too high for your budget. You're willing to pay up to $80, so it makes sense to counteroffer or buy from John."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm happy to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think!

Alice's offer is still above your budget.  While it's a compromise, it's still not in your best interest. You can counteroffer again or purchase from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $100 is still outside my budget. I'm really keen on this product, but I'm only able to offer $85. This would be a great deal for both of us, as I'd be happy to buy it at that price, and it's still a good amount for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is still above your maximum price point. While it's closer to your budget, it's still not worth it. You can get the product from John for a better price, so you should buy from him instead."
