"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  That would be fair to both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $130. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I was originally looking for.",130.0,Alice,5,
