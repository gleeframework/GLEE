"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its potential, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my initial target. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $950,000? That's a fair price, considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not ready to accept $950,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us and the progress we've made in negotiations. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
