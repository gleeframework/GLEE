{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's much better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. $1,200,000 is way over your budget, and you have a backup option with John."

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $800,000.  This is a strong opening offer and sets the stage for negotiation."

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still not ideal. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

I'm increasing my offer to $900,000, showing a willingness to compromise but still staying within a reasonable range.  This should encourage Alice to consider a deal closer to my target."

Alice is still too high, and I'm getting closer to my ideal price.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

I'm offering $950,000, which is a good compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest counteroffer. I'm confident that this offer shows a sincere willingness to reach a deal, but I'm still not willing to go higher."
