"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is significantly above my minimum acceptable value, leaving room for negotiation.  I believe this aggressive opening will encourage Bob to seriously consider the offer and potentially initiate a counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject it. I believe I can get a better price, especially since I have 8 more rounds of negotiation.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's. I'm hoping this will signal my willingness to negotiate while still securing a price that is closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and while I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm still going to reject it.  $1,100,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident that I can still get closer to my desired price. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm hoping that a few more counter-offers will get us closer to a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000.  I'm moving closer to Bob's last offer, but I still believe I can secure a price closer to my desired value. I'm feeling optimistic about finding a middle ground in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and we're running out of time.  I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, I might end up with a price that's significantly less than what I'm comfortable with. 

Since John is willing to buy the product for $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable value, I'm going to sell the product to him. It's a safe and secure option that guarantees me my desired price."
