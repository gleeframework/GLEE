"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a truly unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find its value exceeds the price.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to start by trying to negotiate a better price.  Alice has offered the maximum you're willing to pay, so there's room for negotiation. We don't know the product's value to Alice, so there might be a price that's more favorable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true potential of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1350000.  This offer is a fair compromise and allows us to both benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your initial counteroffer, and $1,350,000 is within your budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. It's a good compromise that allows both parties to benefit."
