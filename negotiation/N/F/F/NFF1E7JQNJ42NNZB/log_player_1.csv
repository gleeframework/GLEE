"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal and worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also being friendly and positive, hoping to build a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, I still want to see if I can get closer to my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal for a product worth so much. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm lowering my price slightly, but still trying to get as close to my minimum as possible. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to try to persuade Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $92 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, so I'm going to try to see if I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $92 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $96? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 96}
``` 

I'm offering a compromise, hoping to meet Bob halfway and get a deal that's closer to my minimum. I'm also trying to sound reasonable and collaborative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $96 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $88 is below my minimum, and I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  I'm not confident I'll be able to get a better offer from Bob, so I'm going to sell to John for $100.  It's a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum."
