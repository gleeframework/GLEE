"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal for a product worth so much. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $92 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $96? That's a fair price for both of us.",96.0,Alice,5,
