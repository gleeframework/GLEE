Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,900,000 now is a safe bet and a significant profit over my minimum.  The longer the negotiation drags on, the higher the risk of Bob dropping out completely."
