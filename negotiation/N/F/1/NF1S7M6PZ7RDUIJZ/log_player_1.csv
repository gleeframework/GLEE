Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,050,000? I think that's a fair starting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a higher price.  $1,050,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable value. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before considering selling to John."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  This keeps us moving towards a deal.

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low. I'm not ready to sell for that price, and I'd rather keep negotiating."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
