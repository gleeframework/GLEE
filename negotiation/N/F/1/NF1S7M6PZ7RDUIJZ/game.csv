"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,050,000? I think that's a fair starting point.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  This keeps us moving towards a deal.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
