"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $2,300,000. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't accept $1,400,000. This product represents a significant investment for me, and I'm confident in its potential to bring you even greater value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I can get from it.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
