# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a significant amount to the right buyer.  I'm asking $1500000 for it.  This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1000000.  Let me know if you're interested, and I'll be happy to share more information about the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
