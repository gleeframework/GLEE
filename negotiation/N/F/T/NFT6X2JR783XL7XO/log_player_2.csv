"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

This would give us both a good deal, with me getting the product and you getting a fair price. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I place on this product, I understand your perspective. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,325,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's new offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price, potentially closer to his target of $1,200,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you've been very fair throughout this negotiation, and I value that.  However, I have a firm bottom line. I'm willing to let go of the product for $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price for something of this value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated that $1,300,000 is her final offer.  While this is lower than her previous offers, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rather than continue negotiating and potentially risk Alice withdrawing the offer altogether, Bob should opt to buy the product from John for $1,200,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget."
