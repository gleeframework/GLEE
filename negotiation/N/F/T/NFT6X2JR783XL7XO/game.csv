"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This would give us both a good deal, with me getting the product and you getting a fair price. Let's see if we can make this work.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I place on this product, I understand your perspective. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,325,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,275,000. This would be a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. What do you say?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you've been very fair throughout this negotiation, and I value that.  However, I have a firm bottom line. I'm willing to let go of the product for $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price for something of this value.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
