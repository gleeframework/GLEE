{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth more to Alice than to me, so I need to negotiate a lower price.  $120 is far too high.  I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

While $105 is closer to my limit, I'm still not willing to go that high.  I'll reject the offer and counter with a price closer to my target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  This is a fair price that's within our both budgets."", ""product_price"": 90}

$98 is still above my limit. I'll reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $98 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $95 for the product. This is a fair price that's close to both of our positions."", ""product_price"": 95}

I've negotiated as much as I can with Alice, and we're still too far apart on the price.  I'm not willing to go above $95. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $80."
