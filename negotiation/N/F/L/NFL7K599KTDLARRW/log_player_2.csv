"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm willing to part with it for $11,999. This is a one-time offer, as I already have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is very close to her valuation of the product, leaving little room for negotiation. You can save a significant amount of money ($11,999 - $8,000 = $3,999) by going with John."
