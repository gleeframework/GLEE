"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $8,800. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However,  $8,800 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Could we try $7,500? I believe that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $8,200. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $8,000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the value it brings to you.",8000.0,Alice,7,
