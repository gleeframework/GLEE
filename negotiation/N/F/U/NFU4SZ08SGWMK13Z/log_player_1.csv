Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What would you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $11,000? I think that's a fair offer.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I can see this is important to you, but $14,500 is still a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $11,500? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is extremely unlikely to go above his stated highest price of $11,500.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from him. It's time to cut losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
