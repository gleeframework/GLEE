"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to me, and gives you a substantial profit margin. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a significant discount from what the product is worth to me.  Let's meet in the middle on this. ",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $900,000, but I need to be careful with my finances.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $825,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,6,
