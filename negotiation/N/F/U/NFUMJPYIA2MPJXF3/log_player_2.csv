"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and John is willing to sell it for that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John immediately is the best option to save time and potential frustration."
