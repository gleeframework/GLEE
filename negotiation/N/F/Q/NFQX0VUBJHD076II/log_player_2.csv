(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than your target of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are not willing to pay her full asking price."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my target, it's still too high. I'll continue negotiating with Alice, as I have more rounds and can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise, but still keeping it significantly lower than Alice's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage her to come down in price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is still too high. I'm willing to negotiate a little more, but I'm not going to give up on getting a lower price. I'll counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by a smaller amount. I'm trying to signal to Alice that I'm getting closer to my limit but still want to see if we can meet in the middle."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,020,000 is closer to my target than previous offers, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I have a few more rounds left, and I believe I can still negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 980000}
```

I'm increasing my offer one last time, but only by a small amount.  I'm hoping this will convince Alice to finally accept a price close to my target.  If she rejects this, I'll have to consider buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unwilling to budge further, and with only one round left, it's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John. While I would have preferred to pay less, getting the product for $800,000 is still a good deal and ensures I achieve my goal of acquiring the product within my budget."
