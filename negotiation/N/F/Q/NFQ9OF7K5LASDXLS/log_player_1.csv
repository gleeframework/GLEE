"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for some room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to try to get closer to that price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,250 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still going to reject the offer. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more, especially since I have 6 rounds remaining and I can always sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,400? This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to get the product at a reasonable price while giving me a fair return on my investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,400. I'd be willing to go up to $9,300, but no higher. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $9,300 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I am going to reject Bob's offer. I have more rounds left and still have the option to sell to John for $12,000. I'm hoping to see if I can push for a price closer to $9,400 or even $9,500 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $9,300 is still a bit below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $9,350, and I really think that's a fair compromise considering we're both meeting halfway. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9350}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,350. I'd be willing to go up to $9,325, but no higher. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,325. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,325
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offer still being lower than my desired price, I am going to choose to sell the product to John for $12,000. While I would have preferred to negotiate a higher price with Bob, the risk of not reaching an agreement with him and losing out on a guaranteed sale to John is too high."
