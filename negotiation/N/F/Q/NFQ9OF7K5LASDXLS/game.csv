,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. Can you consider that?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,400? This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to get the product at a reasonable price while giving me a fair return on my investment. Let me know what you think.",9400.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $9,300 is still a bit below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $9,350, and I really think that's a fair compromise considering we're both meeting halfway. What do you think?",9350.0,Alice,7,
