"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price of $90.  This is slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a little more to get the product, but I'm also prepared to go down in price if necessary.  I'll be closely watching his reaction and his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit.  I'll need to carefully craft a counteroffer that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also doesn't give away too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering at $85. This is a compromise, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. I hope that by showing some flexibility, Bob will be more willing to meet me halfway.  I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $80 if negotiations fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price. I'm confident I can secure a deal closer to $80 or even higher within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $82. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. With only 5 rounds left, I'm hoping this will be the sweet spot to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $78 is tempting, I'm still not comfortable selling for below $80.  I'll reject this offer and try to close the deal for a higher price in the remaining rounds. With only 4 rounds left, it's crucial to get closer to my minimum price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $80, which is my absolute minimum.  I'm hoping that with only 3 rounds left, Bob will realize that this is a fair price and close the deal.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John for $80."
