"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a reasonable offer:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It shows confidence:**  By starting high, you demonstrate your belief in the product's worth.
* **It opens the door for negotiation:**  A polite message encourages Bob to respond and engage in a discussion. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while also ensuring a smooth negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to your minimum price of $150, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting the offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Show Bob that you're not desperate to sell at his price. 
* **Explore higher offers:**  You can potentially get closer to your target by making a counteroffer.
* **Assess the situation:**  See if Bob is truly interested in buying by observing how he responds to your counteroffer. 

Let's try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer acknowledges Bob's offer while still getting closer to your desired price. 
* **Fairness:**  The offer highlights the value of the product and presents it as a reasonable compromise.
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and open dialogue keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $132? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $132 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still determined to get closer to my desired profit. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a slightly higher price. It's important to remember that while John is a guaranteed sale, I can still potentially get a better price from Bob with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're budget-conscious, and I'm trying to be flexible. However, $132 is still a bit too low for me. Let's aim for a price that's fair to both of us. How about we meet at $134? I'm confident you'll find this product incredibly valuable, and this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 134} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm:** By sticking with my initial price, I'm not showing weakness and am still aiming for a better deal.
* **Offering a small compromise:**  This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's offer, indicating a willingness to compromise, but it's still closer to my desired price.
* **Highlighting the value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value helps justify the price. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a successful deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're close, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $131? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but the negotiation has reached a point where it's unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly better price from Bob.  He's consistently offered prices below my minimum, and I've made every effort to compromise.  At this point,  selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and allows me to move on. 

While it would be nice to get a higher price, the risk of further negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer than John's is too great. It's time to secure the deal and avoid further delays."
