"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $15,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and even above her own valuation. It makes sense to negotiate further. You have plenty of room to work with before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move to gauge her flexibility. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This offer provides ample space for negotiation, allowing you to gradually increase your bid while staying within your budget.
* **Expressing Interest:** The message emphasizes your interest in the product, encouraging Alice to work towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is also below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  Alice's offer of $12,000 is still higher than your maximum budget. 
* **Knowing Her Valuation:**  You now know Alice values the product at $12,000. This is useful information for negotiating.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate between your current offer and her valuation. It's too early to settle for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Would you consider $8,000? That's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching Your Limit:**  You're making it clear to Alice that $8,000 is your maximum budget. 
* **Firm but Fair:** The tone remains polite and respectful, but also conveys that you're serious about your price limit. 
* **Putting the Ball in Her Court:** This offer gives Alice a chance to accept a price that's still a profit for her ($8,000 vs. her $12,000 valuation) or counter with a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. My revised offer is $13,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Not Budging:** Alice increased her offer from $12,000 to $13,000. This indicates she's not willing to negotiate within your budget. 
* **Time is a Factor:** You are now halfway through the rounds, and there's no guarantee Alice will significantly reduce her price in the remaining time.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, your maximum budget. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at a reasonable price."
