"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $15000 to us, but I'm willing to start our negotiation at $20000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the premium quality, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",10000.0,Bob,2,
