Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I want to make a deal with Bob, I can't afford to accept such a low offer. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."

Round 4
