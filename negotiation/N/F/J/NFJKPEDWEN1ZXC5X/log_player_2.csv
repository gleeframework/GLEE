"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $120 is within his budget, it's still a significant amount. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $100 is closer, I need to get at least $110 to make this worthwhile for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target:** $110 is still a good deal for Bob, as he is willing to pay up to $150. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's a chance Alice will stick to her price or even raise it, making it less attractive.
* **Time is limited:** With only 7 rounds remaining, Bob can't afford to stall for too long, especially since he has a backup option with John."
