"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** This price is also below Bob's perceived value, which is $150, making it likely he'll consider my offer.
* **Opening Line:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and open-ended to encourage conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob has lowered the price, but it's still above my minimum. I'm not desperate to sell, so I'm willing to continue negotiating.
* **Opportunity to Improve:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price by rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering. 
* **Not Selling to John Yet:** While John offers a guaranteed $80, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob, making it worthwhile to continue."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $100 is closer, I need to get at least $110 to make this worthwhile for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at that price?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Agreement:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm also firm in my need to get a price closer to my desired range.
* **Framing the Price:** I'm proposing a ""middle ground"" to make the offer more appealing and emphasize the shared benefit of reaching an agreement.
* **Maintaining Openness:** The message leaves space for further discussion and negotiation."
