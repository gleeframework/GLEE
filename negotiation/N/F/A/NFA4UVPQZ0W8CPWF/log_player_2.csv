"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly a valuable asset worth $10,000 to you, and I believe it could significantly benefit your endeavors. Let's make this collaboration happen! I'm offering it to you at an exclusive price of $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $9,500.  This is a good deal, but there's room for negotiation. 
* Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my target price. I'd be happy to take it for $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** A $500 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a significant move, but still leaves room for compromise.  
* **Sets the Tone:**  Shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal, and  encourages Alice to be more flexible. 
* **Keeps the Negotiation Going:**  Offers a price point that's potentially attractive to Alice while keeping the process moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. To continue moving forward, I am proposing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This offer reflects a middle ground between our previous discussions, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:**  $9,200 is a good price for Bob, representing a $800 savings from John's offer.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Pushing further risks Alice becoming inflexible, potentially leading to a stalemate or a need to buy from John at a higher price."
