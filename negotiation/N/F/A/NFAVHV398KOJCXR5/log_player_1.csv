"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high offer, aiming to secure a good price while leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to be confident but also open to compromise.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and counter with my own in the next round.  I believe I can still secure a better deal with Bob, and I'm not ready to settle for $750,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  However,  $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $850,000?  That's still a great deal for a product this valuable."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm making a counteroffer at $850,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial price, but still leaves room for potential future negotiation.  I'm confident that this price is fair and attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for you, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $800,000? That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'd love to get more, it's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  It's time to close the deal!"
