Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth the value it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's higher than what Bob is willing to pay but still potentially appealing. This allows room for negotiation and leaves me the option to walk away and sell to John for my desired price if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's closer. I will counter-offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand your position, but I need to get closer to $12,000 to make this work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I am willing to consider $10,500 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. It's likely we'll keep going back and forth, and I'm not sure if we'll reach a price that makes me comfortable. It's best to cut my losses and sell to John for my desired price."
