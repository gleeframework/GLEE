"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a good deal, he can likely get a lower price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure the price is right. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer before I consider other buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to Bob's target, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a better price. He's still within his budget if he needs to buy from John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to come to an agreement. While I value our negotiations, I'm  firmly at $1,090,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I'm not willing to go lower. Let me know if you're serious about buying this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible, and $1,090,000 is close to his target, but not quite there. It seems Alice is getting closer to her bottom line, but Bob still has some leverage to negotiate further. He can likely get a slightly lower price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand we're getting close. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
