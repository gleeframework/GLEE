"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $7,500 is tempting, I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,875?",7875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm really hoping we can find a way to make this work.  $7,875 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's try $8,000.  That's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
