Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offers have been consistently lower than what I'm willing to accept, and we're running out of time.  I'm confident that John will pay me my full asking price, which is more important to me than getting into a drawn-out negotiation with Bob."
