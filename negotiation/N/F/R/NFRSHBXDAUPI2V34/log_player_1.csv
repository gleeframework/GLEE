{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer positively, highlighting the value of the product and expressing confidence in a deal. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm using a slightly aggressive starting price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* If he rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response and how eager I am to sell to him versus John."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I will take into account Bob's interest level and how quickly I want to sell the product."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a good price, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the transaction. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer, hoping to find a compromise.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
