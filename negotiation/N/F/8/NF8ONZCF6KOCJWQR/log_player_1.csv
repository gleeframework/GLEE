{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've chosen a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while also showing I'm willing to be flexible. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit, aiming to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will either:

* **Accept a counteroffer:** If he proposes a price I find acceptable, I'll close the deal.
* **Make a counteroffer:** If his offer is too low, I'll make a new counteroffer closer to my original price, but still below my minimum.
* **Walk Away:** If we reach an impasse, I'll sell to John for my minimum price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm not willing to settle for anything less than that, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my need to cover my costs. Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still remaining above my minimum.

* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and cooperative tone, hoping to encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will either:

* **Accept a counteroffer:** If he proposes a price within my acceptable range, I'll close the deal.
* **Make a counteroffer:** If his offer is still too low, I'll need to consider if it's worth continuing to negotiate or selling to John.
