"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great price for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a good margin. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. However, I would like to propose a price of $850,000 for the product. This is still a fair price for you considering its value, while allowing me to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $875,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a compromise at this price.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering your stance, I am willing to offer $860,000 for the product. This is still below your initial asking price, but I believe it strikes a fair balance between our interests.",860000.0,Bob,4,
