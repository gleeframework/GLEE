"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $15,000 is higher than both your maximum price ($12,000) and John's offer ($12,000). 
* Rejecting this offer allows you to negotiate a lower price with Alice or proceed to buy from John at a better price."
