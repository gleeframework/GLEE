"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is quite high, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer to get us started. I'm proposing to sell it to you for $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,300,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to get this product for closer to my budget.  I'm happy to negotiate, but I'm going to have to start at $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
