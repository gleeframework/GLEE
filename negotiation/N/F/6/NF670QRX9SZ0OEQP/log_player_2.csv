This is a clear case of rejecting Alice's offer.  You are looking for a price of $10,000 or less, and Alice is starting at $13,000. It makes sense to reject and see if you can get a better offer."

While $11,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your ideal price.  You've already shown a willingness to negotiate, and with several rounds left, it's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down further. Remember, John's price is your safety net."
