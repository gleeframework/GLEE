"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm going to start with a slightly high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This will give me some room to negotiate while still aiming for a profit above my minimum."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject and try to get a higher price.  I'll see what Bob counters with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counter again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a smaller drop from my last offer, showing that I'm becoming more serious about closing the deal, but still leaving some room for negotiation."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm running out of rounds, so I need to be careful about making counteroffers too low and ending up with an unacceptable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900}
```

I'm going to make a small counteroffer of $10,900. This shows Bob that I'm getting closer to his offer, but still trying to get a little more. With only a few rounds left, I want to make sure I don't get stuck with a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting close to the end, and while I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm not sure Bob will budge much more. I'm going to sell to John. It's a guaranteed deal, and it meets my minimum requirement."
