"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a strong opening position that allows room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $18,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $19,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to get closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept the offer, or at least prompt him to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."

You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $17,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $18,500.  I'm hoping to meet Bob halfway and potentially close the deal. I believe this is a fair price given the previous negotiations and still allows me to earn a decent amount for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

This is getting close. I'm making a slight concession by offering $17,500. It's a compromise to show I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired $18,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round.  I have two rounds left to negotiate, so there's still time to try and close the deal for a higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $17,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but it's getting closer to my desired price.  It's my last chance to try and get a better price before I have to choose between Bob and John. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to accept, as he knows we are in the final rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough decision. I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, but it's getting late in the negotiation, and I need to ensure I get at least my minimum price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. While it's not the best-case scenario, it guarantees I get my desired minimum and avoids the risk of losing the deal completely."
