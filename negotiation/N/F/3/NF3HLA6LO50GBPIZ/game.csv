"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal for something worth $1,000,000 to you!  Let's make a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high. This product is only worth $1,000,000 to me. How about we start at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $800,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer.  $825,000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to go down to $840,000.  Let's close this deal!",840000.0,Alice,7,
