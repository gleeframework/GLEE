"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high. This product is only worth $1,000,000 to me. How about we start at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm not going to sell for $700,000. That's way too low. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $800,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}

I'm going to counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John. I think we can still get closer to a better deal with Bob."

Round 8

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $830,000. We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit and a better deal than selling to John."
