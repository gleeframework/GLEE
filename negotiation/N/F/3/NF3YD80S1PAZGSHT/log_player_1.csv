Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so anything above that is a win for you.
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum value:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, giving him room to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal.

This offer allows for potential negotiation and gives you a good chance of closing the deal with Bob while still earning a significant profit."
