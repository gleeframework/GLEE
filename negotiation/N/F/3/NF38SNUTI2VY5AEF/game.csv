"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This is still a good price for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,100,000, so I'll offer $1,050,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
