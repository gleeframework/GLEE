Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also needs to offer Bob a price that's enticing. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so any price significantly above that is unlikely to be accepted.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John, so there's no risk of losing out completely."
