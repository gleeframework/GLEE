,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer considering the true value this product holds. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $975,000. This price acknowledges the product's value while still being within my budget. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
