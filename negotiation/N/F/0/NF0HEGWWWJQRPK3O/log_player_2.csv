"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the significant value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. 
* **Negotiation is key:** Bob has 10 rounds and a clear goal of saving money. Rejecting the offer allows him to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but realistic:** Bob is making a significant counteroffer, demonstrating his desire to save money.  $900,000 is still above Alice's minimum, making it a reasonable starting point.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** Bob is framing the counteroffer as a win-win situation, aiming to make Alice feel like she's getting a fair deal. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message ends by inviting Alice to continue the negotiation, keeping the conversation open for a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer considering the true value this product holds. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is being flexible but still too high:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's target price, but $1,050,000 is still above his ideal range.
* **More room for negotiation:**  Bob still has 7 rounds left. Continuing to negotiate could yield a better price.
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  While John's offer is a backup, Bob should continue to explore options with Alice to potentially save more."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $975,000. This price acknowledges the product's value while still being within my budget. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** Bob is now proposing a price that is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates his willingness to compromise.
* **Continuing to save money:**  While still above Bob's ideal, this offer keeps him on track to achieve a good deal.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** Bob uses phrases like ""fair deal"" and ""benefits both of us"" to keep the negotiation amicable."
