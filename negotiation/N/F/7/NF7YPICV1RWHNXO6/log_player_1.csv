"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I'm confident in the product's value at a higher point. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $850,000. Can you consider going a bit lower? I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you meet me at that point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to a price point that reflects the product's value to both of us.  We're still significantly above John's offer, so it's worth pushing a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're close to a deal that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $887,500? This reflects the product's significant value while recognizing your initial offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Can you consider going a bit lower? I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you meet me at that point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has now offered $875,000 twice. This suggests it's likely his ceiling price. While we could try to negotiate further, we risk alienating him and losing the deal entirely. Accepting his offer provides a substantial profit above John's standing offer and avoids the risk of protracted negotiations."
