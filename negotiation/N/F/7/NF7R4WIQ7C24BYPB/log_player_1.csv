Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth $1,000,000 in the right hands.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair deal considering its potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting high ($925,000) aims to capture a significant portion of that perceived value.
* **Room for negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially reaching a price that's still very profitable for Alice. 
* **Justification and urgency:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and frames the price as ""fair"" based on that value. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a reason to accept the offer quickly."
