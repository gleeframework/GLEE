Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know John acts as a safety net, guaranteeing you $1,200,000.  The goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. You need to offer a price that's attractive to him but also significantly above that to maximize your potential profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering $1,150,000 creates a potential win-win:
    * Bob gets the product for $150,000 less than its value to him.
    * You earn $150,000 more than your guaranteed sale to John. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no pressing need to sell immediately. If you need the money urgently, accepting John's offer might be the more practical choice."
