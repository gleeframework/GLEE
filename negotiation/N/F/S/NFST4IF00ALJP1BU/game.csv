"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable to you.  I'm open to negotiation, but my starting price is $1,400,000.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has value, but $1,400,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you halfway.  How about $1,200,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
