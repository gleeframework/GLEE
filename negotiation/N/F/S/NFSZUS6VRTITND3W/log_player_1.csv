Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, giving me room for negotiation, but it's also significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000, leaving room for compromise. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and engaging, emphasizing the potential benefits for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer. 

I chose to start with a relatively high price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll have more information to work with for my next counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $10,000, it's not worth accepting Bob's offer right now. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $9,000 is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a good price.
* **Message:**  The message remains friendly and focuses on the benefit for Bob (""great deal"") while also hinting at my need to get closer to my desired price. This approach keeps the negotiation open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $8,000, so how about $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $10,000, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob. It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
