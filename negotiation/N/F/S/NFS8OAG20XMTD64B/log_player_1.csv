"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product,  worth at least a million dollars to me. I believe it has significant value to you as well.  My initial offer is $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe the product has value, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $1500000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, I am confident in the product's value and believe I can secure a better price.  I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still confident in the product's potential value to you. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the potential it holds for your business."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1350000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While it's not ideal, it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation.  I'll accept the offer to avoid risking a further decrease in price or the potential of losing the deal entirely."
