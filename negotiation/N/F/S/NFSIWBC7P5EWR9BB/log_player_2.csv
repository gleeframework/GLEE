"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price by negotiating. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  It signals to Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but also that you're prepared to negotiate.  $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for compromise while still being below your maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation process and potentially achieve a lower price. You're still within your budget and haven't reached the point where buying from John becomes more attractive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can get good use out of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small step closer to Alice's offer, showing you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a lower price. It also reiterates the value you see in the product, hoping to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference at $8,875. This is a fair price, and I believe we can both walk away happy with this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,875 is a good compromise. It's closer to your ideal price, and it's still well within your budget. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to negotiate or that you'll run out of rounds.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with without risking further negotiation."
