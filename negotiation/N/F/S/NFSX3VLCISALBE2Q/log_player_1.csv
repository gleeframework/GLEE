Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, but let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss the price."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher than that with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can always decrease the price, moving closer to your minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Gauge Interest:** This high initial price will help you gauge Bob's interest level. If he's completely turned off, it suggests he might not be willing to go much higher than his perceived value ($10,000).  

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you don't need to sell the product immediately. If you need to sell it quickly, a lower, more appealing offer to Bob might be a better strategy."
