"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it's more in line with the product's value.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,475,000 is still a bit too low for me. Given the value of this product and the importance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,525,000.  I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges both of our needs.",1525000.0,Alice,5,
