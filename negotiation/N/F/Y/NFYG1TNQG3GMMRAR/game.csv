"Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. It looks great, but $7,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're not willing to go as low as $6,000, Alice.  How about we split the difference between your offer and mine? Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,4,

"I see what you're trying to do, Bob! I appreciate the compromise, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $6,800, which is still a great deal for you. It's a small step closer to my original price, but I think it's worth it for this amazing product.",6800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $6,800 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for a final price of $6,600.  What do you say?",6600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to giving in, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $6,700, which is just a small step away from your final offer. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal.",6700.0,Alice,7,
