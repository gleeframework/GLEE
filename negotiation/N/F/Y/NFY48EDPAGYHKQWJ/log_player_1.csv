Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's still within a reasonable range. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed. If he rejects, I can always counter with a lower price or simply sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is more than my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I'll try to counter with a slightly lower offer, but still above my minimum.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to go down a bit. How about $95? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$90 is a fair price considering Bob's initial counteroffer and my desire to avoid selling to John for less. This offer is above my minimum, so I'm happy to accept."
