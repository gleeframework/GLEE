"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $8000 on this item. Would you consider accepting such an offer?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Would you consider purchasing the product for $9000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While I'm willing to pay more than $8000, I can't afford to exceed $8500 at this time. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between these prices?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to go up to $8500, Bob. I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $8500. How about we meet at $9200? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for this unique product.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still unable to meet you at $9200. Could we perhaps find a middle ground at $8800?",8800.0,Bob,6,
