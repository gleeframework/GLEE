Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a compromise."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,600,000 is closer to where I need to be, it's still a significant jump from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
