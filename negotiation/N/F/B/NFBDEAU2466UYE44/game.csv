"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a unique opportunity for your business and I believe it can bring significant value. My starting price is $1,750,000. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still allows for a significant return on investment for you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,600,000 is closer to where I need to be, it's still a significant jump from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 still falls short of my minimum expectation.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,400,000. This price reflects the value I know this product can bring to your business. Let's aim for a final agreement in this round.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand we're nearing the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $1,350,000.  This price represents a fair compromise, and I believe it allows for a successful outcome for both of us. Let's close the deal this round.",1350000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000 for the product. This is the absolute highest I can go.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to consider other options.",1325000.0,Bob,8,
