Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than his perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can still make a profit if Bob accepts, and if he rejects, I can always go back to John and sell for my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target.  I will counteroffer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $950,000. This is a compromise that acknowledges his offer while still allowing me to make a decent profit. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my target price, it's still not enough to make the sale worthwhile. I don't want to risk further negotiations that might lower the price even more. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit of $1,200,000."
