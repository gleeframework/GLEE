"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you at a price that reflects its value. I'm asking $1,750,000.  This price is fair given the product's potential, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be happy to pay $1,400,000.  This price reflects the potential of the product while still being within my budget.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the product's true worth. I'm prepared to accept $1,600,000.  This price is still fair given the product's potential and allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's try to reach an agreement, as I truly believe this product has great potential for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000. This price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  I'm confident this is a fair offer for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
