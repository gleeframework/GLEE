{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
