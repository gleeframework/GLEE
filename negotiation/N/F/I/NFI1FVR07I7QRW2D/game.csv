"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9500 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $9200. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $8500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm thinking of a price of $9000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I think we're getting closer. $9000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $8750. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,6,
