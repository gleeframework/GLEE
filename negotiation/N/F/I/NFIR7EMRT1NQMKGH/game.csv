"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1200000 is a significant sum, I'm confident the product's unique capabilities will deliver exceptional value for you. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it for $1350000. This represents a compromise while still reflecting the product's worth. I'm open to further discussion, but I believe this price point allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
