"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You can likely get a better price than $130, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be interested in buying it for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $135. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still aiming for a price closer to your target of $120, and Alice's offer of $135 is still a bit high.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $135 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet at $130?  That's a good compromise, and it's a price I'm comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $130 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $132. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $132 is getting closer to your target price of $120 and is definitely a better deal than buying from John for $150.  It's time to accept the offer and close the deal."
