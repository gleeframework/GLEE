Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me. This is a common tactic in negotiations to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I will reject it and attempt to negotiate a better price.  While selling to John for $100 is an option, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  Hopefully, this shows flexibility while still aiming for a price that's more profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $85 is closer to my minimum and getting closer to his perceived value. Further negotiation could drag this out, and there's always the risk of a breakdown.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit, which is important."
