{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $85?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $85 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $80.  This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 80}
