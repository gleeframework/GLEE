The product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $1,100,000. This is significantly more than your maximum budget. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

You are offering $850,000, which is still significantly less than Alice's offer but within your budget. This is a good starting point for negotiation."

While $1,050,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price.  You should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."

You're increasing your offer slightly, but still staying within your budget. This shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but you're also not willing to overpay."

Alice is not budging much. The negotiation is getting tiring and you're likely not going to get a significantly better price. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John. You'll save yourself a lot of time and energy, and you'll still get the product at a price that's worth it to you."
