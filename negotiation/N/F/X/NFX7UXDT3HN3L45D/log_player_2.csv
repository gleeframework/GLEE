You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Bob should reject the offer. $900,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $800,000 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product for $800,000 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before buying from John."

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $815,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and he has a guaranteed deal with John for $800,000.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a better price."
