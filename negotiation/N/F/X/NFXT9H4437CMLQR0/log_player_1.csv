Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  However, $1500000 is significantly over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $800,000 is too low for me. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see something closer to my initial asking price. Let's try $1,200,000.  This is a fair price for the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1200000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's split the difference.  I'm prepared to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is a fair price, and it allows us to both walk away happy.  It's also important to note that if I reject this offer, there's a good chance I'll end up selling to John for the same price anyway, and I'd rather close the deal with Bob."
