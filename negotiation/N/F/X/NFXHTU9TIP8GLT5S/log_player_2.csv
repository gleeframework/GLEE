"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This offer is much higher than both your budget and Alice's valuation. It's worth negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Could we work something closer to $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000} 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  It's strategic to begin negotiations significantly lower than your target price. This gives you bargaining room and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Anchoring:** By presenting $6,000, you are setting a lower anchor point for the negotiation, potentially influencing Alice to consider prices in a lower range. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A large gap between your initial offer and Alice's asking price gives you space to gradually increase your offer during subsequent rounds if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $6,000 is too low for me.  Could you do $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved down considerably, $11,000 is still significantly higher than your target price and John's offer.  There's room for further negotiation to see if you can get closer to your ideal outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we settle somewhere around $7,500?"", ""product_price"": 7500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:** We're moving up in smaller increments to show willingness to negotiate but also to avoid large jumps that might make Alice less willing to bargain.
* **Staying Below John's Price:** It's important to keep our offers below $8,000, ensuring we're always getting a better deal than John's guaranteed price if Alice agrees.
* **Targeting the Midpoint:**  $7,500 aims for roughly the midpoint between your previous offer and Alice's current offer, seeking a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is still above your maximum budget and John's offer. It's unlikely Alice will come down further, especially since she's already closer to her valuation. You're better off taking the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000."
