"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $12000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16000. I believe this price still represents a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",16000.0,Alice,3,
