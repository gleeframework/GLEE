"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussion."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired outcome. This leaves room for concessions and gives the impression the product holds high value. 
* **Not Too High:** While we start high, going significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) could alienate him. 
* **Leaving Room:** The offer of $1,100,000 leaves a decent margin for negotiation while staying within a reasonable range of Bob's potential acceptance. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message aims to be positive and collaborative, framing the offer as a starting point for a beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum ($1,200,000). We have room to negotiate and test his willingness to move closer to our range. Selling to John right now would mean leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value.  However, my initial price took into account several key factors that justify a higher valuation.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's potential."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We've reduced our price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Hold Ground (For Now):**  This decrease is a strategic move, but we're not drastically dropping our price. We're still aiming to secure a price well above Bob's initial offer.
* **Justification:** We're vaguely alluding to other factors influencing the price, which might pique Bob's curiosity and potentially give us leverage later.
* **Positive Framing:** We frame the concession as significant and reiterate our belief in the product's value to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think $900,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and your initial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now incrementally increasing his offers, but $975,000 is still significantly less than our $1,200,000 walk-away point. We need to show him that we're willing to walk away if he doesn't increase his offer substantially.  We will aim higher in the next round to gauge his seriousness."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but the gap between our positions remains significant. This product holds substantial value beyond what you're currently offering. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,025,000, but that's my final offer. I believe it reflects the product's true worth while still acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** We've shifted our language to be more assertive, signaling that we're getting closer to our limit. ""Final offer"" is a strong statement, even if we might be bluffing slightly.
* **Smaller Concession:**  We've only reduced our price by $25,000 this round, emphasizing that we're serious about the value.
* **Alternative:** We're implying that walking away (and potentially selling to John) is a real option for us if Bob doesn't meet our price. 
* **Time Pressure:** As we progress through the rounds, the implicit pressure of a limited time frame might push Bob to be more agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob's counteroffer shows minimal movement from his previous position. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer beyond this point.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks missing out on the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  The potential gain from continuing with Bob is not worth the risk of him walking away.
* **Stronger Position:** By walking away, we demonstrate the seriousness of our valuation and our willingness to pursue other options. There's a slight chance Bob might reconsider and return with a much higher offer (though it's not guaranteed).

Overall, accepting Bob's current offer would leave a significant amount of money on the table. Selling to John guarantees the best possible outcome in this scenario."
