"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both parties. To start, I propose a price of $1200000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal.  Bob has 10 rounds to try to get the price down further, and it's unlikely Alice will sell for her minimum value in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get the product for a bit less.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value this product holds for you, I am willing to negotiate further. My proposal for the product price is $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his desired price, it's still $100,000 higher than his counteroffer.  He should continue to negotiate to see if he can get a better price.  Remember, Bob has a strong leverage point with the option to purchase from John at $1,500,000, so he can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. In light of this, I am proposing a price of $1075000 for the product. This reflects a middle ground between our respective positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  It's within his budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. While he could continue to negotiate, it's likely Alice won't go much lower, and he risks running out of rounds.  Accepting at this point secures a good deal."
