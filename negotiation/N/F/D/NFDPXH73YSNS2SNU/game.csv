"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my research and the product's current market value, I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $750,000 would be significantly below its true value and potential.  I could consider coming down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This seems like a fair price for both of us, given my research and the product's potential.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher figure. How about we meet in the middle at $887,500? This accounts for the product's true worth while acknowledging your offer.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $887,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still allowing me to meet my budget.",875000.0,Bob,6,
