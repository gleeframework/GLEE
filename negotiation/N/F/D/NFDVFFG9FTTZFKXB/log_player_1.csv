"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price with more negotiation.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,700,000 at this point, and will counter with a price closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,750,000. This is a more reasonable price, but still leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a price closer to this amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,700,000 at this point, and will counter with a price closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of slowly decreasing my price, but I'm not willing to go lower than $1,700,000 yet.  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe he'll come up a bit more to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is getting close to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn.  The difference between Bob's offer and my ideal price is small enough that it's worth accepting.  I'm confident I'll be able to find another buyer if this one falls through."
