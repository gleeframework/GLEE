{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to reasonable negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum price, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  Bob is willing to pay $150, so he might be happy to negotiate a bit lower.
* **It's open-ended:** The message indicates you're open to negotiation, which can make Bob feel more comfortable engaging. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $130? That's still a good price for you, and it's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is still above your minimum of $120, and it's likely the best deal you'll get.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's not guaranteed that you'll get a better price.  Accepting his offer secures a sale and maximizes your potential profit."
