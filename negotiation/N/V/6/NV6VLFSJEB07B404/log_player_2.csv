Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $1200000.

# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $1100000.
