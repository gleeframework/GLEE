"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $2000000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2000000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $600000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $1200000. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford at this time. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to look at other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
