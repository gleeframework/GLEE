It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $12,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my costs and the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still too high for me. It's better to just buy from John and get the product for $10,000."
