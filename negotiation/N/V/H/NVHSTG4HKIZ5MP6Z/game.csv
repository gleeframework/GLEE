"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1200000, but I'd like to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can include a premium support package and a 10% discount on the total price.

"I understand you're still hesitant about the price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I'd like to remove the premium support package from the deal.

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, but I'd like to keep the premium support package. This is my last offer on the price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll meet you at $990000, but I'll also throw in a 2-year warranty on the product, which is a significant value-add. This is my absolute final offer. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,9,

I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product, and I'd like to keep the premium support package and 2-year warranty. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1200000.",980000.0,Bob,10,
