Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $10,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's more than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's less than my minimum acceptable price:**  I'm still making a profit, and I can always fall back on John if Bob rejects the offer.

I'm confident that Bob will likely make a counteroffer. This will give me an opportunity to negotiate a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a decent price, I'm still willing to hold out for a better deal.  Here's why:

* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. He's already shown interest by making a counteroffer, suggesting he's willing to pay more than $8,000.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John for $12,000 would be the most lucrative option, but I'm not willing to give up on the possibility of getting closer to that amount with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially secure a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising the price slightly to $9,500. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting closer to my desired price while still being open to negotiation. 

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but not cave in.
* **Lower than my initial offer:** It shows good faith and encourages Bob to continue the conversation.

My goal is to get as close as possible to $10,000 without pushing Bob away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I would love to continue negotiating and get closer to my initial goal of $10,000, the risk of losing the deal completely outweighs the potential gain.  

* **Bob's Offer is Almost Acceptable:**  $9,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $9,000. The difference is only $250.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I risk him walking away completely.  There's no guarantee he'll come back with a better offer, and I could end up with nothing.
* **Alternative Option:**  I have the safety net of selling to John for $12,000.  This allows me to take a calculated risk with Bob, knowing I have a guaranteed backup plan.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer of $9,250 is the most sensible choice. It secures a sale at a reasonable price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal entirely."
