It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. Even if it fails, you can always buy from John for $8,000."

I'm offering $9,000. This is still a good deal for Alice, as it's more than what she would get from John, and it's closer to my budget."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still going to reject Alice's offer. I can buy the product from John for $8,000, so there's still room to negotiate with Alice. I'll try to get a lower price from her in the next round."

I'm offering $9,250.  This is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from my previous offer. It's still a better deal for Alice than selling to John, and it's closer to my budget."
