"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product,  $2000000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm happy to offer you $1600000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1800000. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1800000.  However, I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $1700000.  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1750000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
