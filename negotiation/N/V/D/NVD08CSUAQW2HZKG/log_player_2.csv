"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $14,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is above your budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You have a good bargaining position since you can buy from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This offer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than John's offer, giving Alice some room to negotiate. 
* **Fairness:**  Offering $10,500 is a fair middle ground considering your budget and Alice's likely desire to get more than her minimum of $12,000.
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation.  Alice might counter with a price closer to your offer, or you may need to adjust yours slightly depending on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $10,500.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,250 is still above my budget of $10,000. I'm willing to pay more than $10,000 because the product is likely worth more to me, but I'm not ready to accept a price that's above my initial target. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $12,250 is a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,375?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11375}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair compromise:** This offer is a compromise between your previous offer ($10,500) and Alice's latest offer ($12,250). It's a middle ground that demonstrates you're willing to meet halfway.
* **Motivation:** This offer shows Alice that you are serious about purchasing the product and are willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic:** This offer gives Alice a chance to accept without losing too much, or to counter with a price closer to your offer."
