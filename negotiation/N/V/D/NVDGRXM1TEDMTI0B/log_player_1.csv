Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that might interest you. I'm looking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly above Bob's value, leaving room for bargaining. It also emphasizes the product's value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference at $115? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $105? I think that's a fair price for the product 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to lose money on this sale. It's time to move on to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
