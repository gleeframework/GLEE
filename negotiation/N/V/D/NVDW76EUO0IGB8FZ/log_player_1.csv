Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I believe it's a great deal and would be very useful for you."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could sell to John for $150, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $145 creates a potential win-win.  It's a smaller profit margin for you, but still above your minimum, and Bob gets a better price than your fallback option.
* **Clear Communication:**  The message is direct and highlights the value proposition for Bob. 
 
**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $145. If you want to ensure a sale, offering it at $120 (his perceived value) would guarantee it, but that would mean leaving potential profit on the table."
