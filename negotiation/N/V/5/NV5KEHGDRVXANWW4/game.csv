"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $145? This would be a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $130? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $140. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise.",140.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",125.0,Bob,6,
