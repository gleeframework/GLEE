"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential, and it's a good starting point for further negotiation. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,800,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price point. Would you consider $2,100,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests. What do you think?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
