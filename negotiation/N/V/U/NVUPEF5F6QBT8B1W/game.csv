"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $6,000 is too far below my minimum.  Would you consider $8,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is closer, but still a little high for my budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try $8,000. It's a good compromise that's still fair considering the value of the product.  I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",8000.0,Alice,5,
