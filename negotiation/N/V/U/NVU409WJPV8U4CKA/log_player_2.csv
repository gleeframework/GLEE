"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product for a one-time price of $180. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than both your maximum price ($100) and what John offers ($100). It makes the most sense to buy from John."
