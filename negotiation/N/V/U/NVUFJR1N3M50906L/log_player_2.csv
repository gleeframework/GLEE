"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $15,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price slightly rather than lose the sale. By rejecting her initial offer, you give yourself room to negotiate a better deal."
