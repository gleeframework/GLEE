Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm starting with a price of $950,000. This is a good starting point because it's:
    * **Higher than my minimum:** I want at least $800,000, so this leaves room for negotiation.
    * **Lower than Bob's perceived value:**  There's room for Bob to feel he's getting a good deal while still leaving me with a substantial profit.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and focused on the value of the product to Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Get the negotiation started:**  A clear offer encourages Bob to respond.
* **Establish a strong starting point:**  My initial offer is high enough to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  Both of us have space to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $820,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $880,000.

* **Reasoning:** This counteroffer aims to:
    * **Signal my willingness to negotiate:**  I'm showing Bob that I'm flexible and open to compromise.
