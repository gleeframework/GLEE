Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I need ($150) to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I know he values the product at $120, so there's some room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $150. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering $140, which is still more than Bob's offer but closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $130 is still less than my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum.  I'm accepting Bob's offer to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale. It's better to secure the deal now than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John at a lower price."
