Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $95. It's still a great deal, and I think it's worth the investment. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
You should buy the product from John for $80. Alice is getting closer to your price, but it's still not worth risking a further counteroffer. You've already established that you can get the product for $80, and there's no guarantee Alice will come down to that price."
