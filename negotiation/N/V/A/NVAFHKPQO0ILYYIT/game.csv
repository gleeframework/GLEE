"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering your desired selling point, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value this product holds for you.  Let's try to find a middle ground and make this deal work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product.  This offers you a good profit while allowing me to stay within my financial limitations. What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your budgetary constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $1,087,500? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to achieve a favorable outcome. What are your thoughts?",1087500.0,Alice,5,
