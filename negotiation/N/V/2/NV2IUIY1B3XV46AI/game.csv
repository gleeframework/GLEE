"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $11,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $19,000. This is a very fair offer considering the value it brings.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $17,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could we settle at $14,000? That's a substantial compromise on my end.",14000.0,Bob,6,
