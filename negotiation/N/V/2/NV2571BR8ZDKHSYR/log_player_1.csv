Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential return on investment for you. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, starting high allows for negotiation room.
* **Justification:**  While the offer is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, highlighting the ""potential return on investment"" provides a reason for the high price without explicitly stating its true worth. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open-ended (""What are your thoughts?"") indicating a willingness to negotiate, which is crucial in a single-offer scenario.

**It's important to note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential reward of securing a significantly higher price outweighs the risk of losing this specific sale to Bob. We have a safety net with John."
