Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
