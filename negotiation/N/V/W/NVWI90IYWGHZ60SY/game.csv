Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.,9000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8200. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $8200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7800 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering our previous negotiations and the market value.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8100. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations.",8100.0,Alice,5,
