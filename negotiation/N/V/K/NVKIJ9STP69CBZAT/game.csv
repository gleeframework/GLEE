"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if we can meet in the middle!",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I think that's fair considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10,000 to $10,500. How about we go with $10,250? That's a bit closer to what I'm comfortable with.",10250.0,Bob,4,
