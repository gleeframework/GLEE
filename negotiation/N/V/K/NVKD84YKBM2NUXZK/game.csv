"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you have a limited budget, but I'm afraid the product's value is higher than what you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand your position, my budget still doesn't allow me to reach that price. I would like to propose $1000000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is a fair price for this exceptional product.

This is my final compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the product's true value.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum threshold. I'm counteroffering at $1150000, just like in round 5. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
