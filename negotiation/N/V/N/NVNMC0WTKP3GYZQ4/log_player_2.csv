It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice is clearly holding firm around the $750,000 mark and inching upwards. While we still have rounds left, it's unlikely she'll come down enough to make staying worthwhile. John's price is a guaranteed win at this point, even if it means spending a bit more than we'd hoped."
