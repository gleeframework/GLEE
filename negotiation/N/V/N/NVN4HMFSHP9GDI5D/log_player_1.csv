"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. My starting price is $175. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to give me room to negotiate. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more likely to consider the offer. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. How about $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me more room to bargain. 
* **Time Remaining:**  We are still early in the negotiation process (round 2). There's time to explore better options.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $175 to $160, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $160 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and open to further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely watch Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If Bob rejects my offer again, I might consider lowering my price slightly in the next round. However, I'll also be mindful of the time limit and the alternative offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, could we possibly agree on $140 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Close to John's Offer:**  John is offering $150, which is only $10 more than Bob's offer.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap with Bob. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  I have more rounds to negotiate and can potentially increase the price closer to my minimum acceptable value.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price slightly higher than Bob's offer but still below John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we split the difference and settle on $145? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $145 is a compromise,  splitting the difference between Bob's offer of $140 and my previous offer of $160.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $145 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair"" price for both parties to make it more appealing.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he accepts, I've successfully negotiated a good deal. If he rejects, I'll need to reassess my strategy, considering the remaining rounds and the alternative offer from John."
