"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I can only pay up to $12,000 for it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for adjusting your offer, Alice. I'm willing to consider $13,000, but let's see if we can get closer to my budget. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference â€“ $12,750. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",12750.0,Alice,5,
