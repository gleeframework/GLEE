"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8000.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your offer of $8500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $9500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make a smart financial decision.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9250, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
