Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible while still exceeding what John will pay.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering a price significantly lower than Bob's perceived value might make him suspicious or undervalue the product.  A price of $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** There's a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, since Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her minimum acceptable price, she can confidently start the negotiation at a higher point."
