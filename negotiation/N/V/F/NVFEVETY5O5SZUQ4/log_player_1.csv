Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the $10,000 you estimate. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's personality and negotiation style, you might adjust your approach. For example, you could start with a slightly lower price if you think Bob is highly price-sensitive."
