{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$600,000 is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal. There's no harm in trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows my interest in buying but also establishes a clear expectation of negotiation.  I'm confident I can find a compromise within the remaining rounds."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $450,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying within a range that represents a good deal for me. I believe this offer is reasonable and likely to be accepted by Alice, especially as we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly to $550,000, which is closer to my target price.  While I'd prefer to negotiate further, we're already halfway through the rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product within my budget and leaves room for potential future negotiation if the product turns out to be worth more than I initially estimated."
