"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do right now. Let's get this deal done!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $145. This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $145 isn't quite where I need to be. How about we split the difference and settle on $152.50? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",152.5,Alice,5,
