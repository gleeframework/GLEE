Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a price of $14,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so Alice needs to offer a price low enough to entice him but high enough to maximize her profit.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Alice knows John will buy the product for $15,000, guaranteeing her a minimum sale price. 

By offering the product at $14,500, Alice aims for a price that's:

* **Attractive to Bob:** It's significantly above Bob's valuation, but the ""exclusive first offer"" framing might make it appealing.
* **Highly Profitable for Alice:** If Bob accepts, Alice makes a $2,500 profit. 

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential for a higher profit outweighs the risk of getting the guaranteed $15,000 from John in this scenario."
