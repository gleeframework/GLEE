Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product today for $10,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will indicate how much he values the product. If he accepts immediately, you know you might have gone lower. If he negotiates, you can work towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Backup Plan:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 provides a safety net. You don't have to settle for anything less than your minimum."
