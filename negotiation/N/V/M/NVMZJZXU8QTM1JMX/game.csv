"I'm still not convinced that $1,450,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. Can we meet there?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. It's clear we both see the value in this product. To bridge the gap, I propose a price of $1,375,000. This feels like a fair point considering its unique features and potential.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, but I need to be at or below that. Can we try $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Bob,6,
