"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its worth and am open to discussing this further."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a strong anchor price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception of the product's high value. 
* **Justification:**  I provide a brief justification focused on ""value and potential"" without revealing specifics.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I signal willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage in the process.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:**  By starting high, I aim to secure a final price closer to Bob's maximum willingness to pay.
2. **Gauge Bob's interest:** His response will reveal how much he values the product and how aggressively he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than his perceived value of $800,000. This suggests he's willing to pay a premium, and there's room for me to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Negotiating Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I signal that I believe the product is worth more. This keeps the negotiation power in my favor.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 gives me a strong fallback position. I don't need to rush into accepting an offer below my expectations. 

I'll aim to bring Bob closer to my desired price point in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation. While I recognize your proposed price, I believe it undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This feels like a fairer reflection of its potential."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've reduced my price by $150,000, demonstrating movement and willingness to negotiate. However, this concession is calculated; I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and his perceived value.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I continue to subtly emphasize the product's ""unique advantages"" and ""potential"" without revealing specifics. This reinforces its desirability and justifies the higher price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** By framing my counteroffer as a ""fairer reflection"" and seeking ""middle ground,"" I encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more aggressive counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,450,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. Can we meet there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Trend, But Room Remains:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product. However, $1,300,000 is still significantly below my initial ask and a considerable margin above his perceived value.  
* **Time as a Factor:** While I have six rounds remaining, I don't want to give the impression I'm desperate to close the deal.  A firm rejection now might encourage Bob to make a more substantial jump in his next offer.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** The guaranteed $1,000,000 from John allows me to maintain a strong position. 

I'll aim for a counteroffer that keeps the negotiation moving but pushes for a price closer to $1,400,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. It's clear we both see the value in this product. To bridge the gap, I propose a price of $1,375,000. This feels like a fair point considering its unique features and potential."",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession, Firm Stance:**  I'm reducing my price by $75,000, a smaller concession than before. This signals that I'm getting closer to my bottom line while still acknowledging Bob's movement. 
* **Value Reaffirmation:** I reiterate the product's ""unique features and potential,"" subtly reminding Bob of its worth beyond his initial perception. 
* **Encouraging a Final Push:**  By framing this price as ""fair,"" I'm subtly challenging Bob to meet me closer to my number if he truly wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, but I need to be at or below that. Can we try $1,325,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is a significant profit over my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price, the potential gains are smaller compared to the risk of Bob walking away.  
* **Time Remaining:** With only four rounds left, there's a chance negotiations could stall, and I'd risk losing the deal entirely.

This offer represents a strong balance between profit maximization and deal security."
