Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
