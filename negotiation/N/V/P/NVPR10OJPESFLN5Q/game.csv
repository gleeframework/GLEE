"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering the unique benefits it provides.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that the product has unique benefits, but I still think $1,300,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,050,000. Can we meet in the middle?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
