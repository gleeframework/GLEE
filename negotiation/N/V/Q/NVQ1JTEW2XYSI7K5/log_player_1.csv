Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you, and I'm willing to make a special offer of $1,400,000.  This is a time-sensitive offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it for $1,000,001 and Bob would likely accept, aiming slightly higher allows us to potentially gain an extra $400,000.
* **John as a Guarantee:**  We have a safety net with John willing to pay the full $1,500,000. This gives us leverage to negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By creating a sense of urgency and making Bob feel like he's getting a special deal, we increase the chances of him accepting a higher price. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, given the information, this strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the security of a guaranteed sale to John."
