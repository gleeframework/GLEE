"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can only afford to pay up to $9500. I hope this proposal works for you.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $9500 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product. Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am able to offer $10500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $10500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11500.  This is a fair compromise and allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and I would like to counter with an offer of $11000 for the product. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Bob,6,
