Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get, encouraging him to see the potential.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By not starting at my minimum of $15,000, I'm giving Bob the opportunity to make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation dynamic. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can only afford to pay up to $9500. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than my desired price.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe I can still get closer to my target by making a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If the negotiation fails, I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $9,500 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Staying above my minimum:** I'm still above my minimum of $15,000, ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Appealing to logic:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to persuade Bob to agree. 
* **Maintaining control:** I'm not giving in too quickly, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am able to offer $10500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe I can still get closer to my target with one more counteroffer. I want to see if I can get him to go up to $11,500.
* **John's offer is my safety net:** If the negotiation fails, I'll have John as a backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $10,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500.  This is a fair compromise and allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a final compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $11,500, I'm essentially offering to split the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Finality:**  I'm explicitly stating that this is my final offer, leaving Bob with a clear decision to make.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:**  I'm confident that if Bob rejects this, I can sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and I would like to counter with an offer of $11000 for the product. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not enough:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **No room for further negotiation:**  I've already made several concessions and reached a point where there's minimal room for further bargaining. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** By selling to John for $15,000, I'm guaranteed a much higher profit than I would get by accepting Bob's offer. 

While it's tempting to continue negotiating with Bob, I'm choosing to secure a profitable deal with John. This decision minimizes the risk of further negotiation and ensures that I achieve my goal of maximizing my earnings."
