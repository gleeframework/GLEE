Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding our minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below our guaranteed sale price with John allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price higher than $120.
* **Create Urgency:**  The ""limited time"" phrase adds a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly and not overthink the offer."
