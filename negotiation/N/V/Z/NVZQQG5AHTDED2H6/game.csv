"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still below what it's worth to me. I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I am not able to meet your asking price of $1,200,000. I am willing to offer $950,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is still a good deal for you, as it's well under what the product is worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I am still committed to finding a fair price for both of us. I would like to propose $1,000,000 as a compromise, which is closer to your original asking price but still within my budget. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial solution.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
