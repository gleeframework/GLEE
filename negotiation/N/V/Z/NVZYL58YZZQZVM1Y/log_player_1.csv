Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $8,750. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 8750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations slightly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price exorbitantly high (like double) is likely to make Bob walk away immediately.  $8,750 is a significant markup but not completely unreasonable.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message aims to be confident and positive, emphasizing the product's value to Bob. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob negotiates or expresses hesitation."
