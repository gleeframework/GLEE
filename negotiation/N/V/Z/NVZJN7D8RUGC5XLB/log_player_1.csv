{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's aggressive:**  It leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a high price. 
* **It's justified:** I explain the value to Bob, making it more likely he'll consider my offer.
* **It provides a clear next step:**  This ensures the negotiation moves forward.

Remember, I can always fall back to John's offer if Bob rejects my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum desired amount. I need to try to push for a higher offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand your perspective, but this product is truly worth more.  How about we split the difference at $1,250,000? It's a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm aiming for a compromise here.  

* **Reasoning:** I'm acknowledging Bob's position while still pushing for a price closer to my ideal.
* **Compromise:**  Splitting the difference shows I'm willing to negotiate and helps  keep the conversation positive. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $1,250,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $1,175,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,175,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation.  It's possible I can get Bob closer to my ideal price with a good counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,175,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000.  This would be a significant investment for you, and I'm confident the product will deliver a strong return.  Let's try to find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Here's why I'm making this counteroffer:

* **Staying above minimum:** $1,200,000 is still above my minimum desired price.
* **Show flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate further while still holding firm on my value.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the potential return on investment for Bob to encourage him to reconsider.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining a strong position."
