Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $150, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $145 tempts Bob with a price higher than his perceived value ($120) but still represents a ""deal"" compared to my guaranteed sale price.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing potential profit."
