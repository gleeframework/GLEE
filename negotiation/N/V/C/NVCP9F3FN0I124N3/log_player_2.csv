"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum price point, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  You have leverage by knowing you have another seller (John) willing to sell for the same price. This allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from her original offer. This is a good deal for Bob, especially considering John is selling the same product for $1,200,000.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
