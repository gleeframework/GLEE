{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum price, but also acknowledges Bob's lower offer. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $105 is a good price, and it's worth it to close the deal rather than risk further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
