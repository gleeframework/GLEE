"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $11,500. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

You can likely get a better price than $11,500 since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice. You should counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value is quite high. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a fair price considering her initial offer and your counteroffer.  It's a good deal for both of you."
