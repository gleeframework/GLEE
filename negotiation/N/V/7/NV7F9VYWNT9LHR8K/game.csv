"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $110. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
