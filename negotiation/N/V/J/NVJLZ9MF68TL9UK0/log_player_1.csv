"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price point. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Confident Positioning:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing its minimum worth to Alice. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, you create space for counteroffers and a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly above Alice's minimum. Rejecting this offer signals that Alice is looking for a price closer to her initial offer, encouraging Bob to potentially increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,800,000 is still significantly below what I had in mind.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer it for $2,100,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and its potential returns."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Alice is making a concession by lowering her price, but it's a calculated move. The decrease is substantial enough to show flexibility but not so drastic that it undermines the product's perceived value.
* **Reiterating Value:** The message reinforces the product's value, reminding Bob of its potential and justifying the higher price point.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** Alice is still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating her confidence and the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and potential returns. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, we're still in a good negotiating position.  Alice has room to negotiate down further from her last offer ($2,100,000) and still end up significantly above her $1,500,000 minimum. It's worth seeing if Bob will come up further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. To demonstrate my desire to close this deal, I'm willing to come down to $2,025,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 2025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong but Fair:** This offer splits the difference between the previous two offers, showing a willingness to compromise while still holding firm on a price significantly above Alice's minimum.
* **Finality:** By stating this is her final offer, Alice creates a sense of urgency and signals to Bob that further haggling might not be fruitful. 
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  Even if Bob accepts this final offer, Alice is securing a substantial profit over her minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1,900,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is still significantly above Alice's minimum price of $1,500,000, resulting in a healthy profit.
* **Minimizing Risk:** By accepting now, Alice avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away in subsequent rounds. John's standing offer provides a safety net but at a lower profit margin. 
* **Bob's Final Offer:**  Bob has signaled this is his final offer, making it less likely he'll significantly increase it in future rounds. Pushing further risks jeopardizing the deal."
