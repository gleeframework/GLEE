"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the potential value of the product for Bob to make the offer more enticing.

**Important Note:** I'm keeping my minimum price in mind and will be prepared to negotiate further. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the value I'm aiming for.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.
* **Negotiation Room:** Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a higher price.
* **Potential for Better Outcome:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price than Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my minimum.  I'll continue to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. I'll also keep in mind my ""sell to John"" option as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This gives us both a good deal, and I think we can close this deal quickly. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and makes it seem like a fair deal.
* **Time Sensitive:** I'm emphasizing closing the deal quickly to create a sense of urgency and potentially encourage Bob to accept.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** My offer is still above my minimum, but it's getting closer to Bob's perceived value. This could lead to a successful deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response and be prepared to either accept his counteroffer (if it's close enough to my minimum) or make another counteroffer if necessary.  I'll also continue to weigh the option of selling to John if negotiations with Bob stall."
