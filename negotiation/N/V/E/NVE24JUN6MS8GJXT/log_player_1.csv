Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob negotiates a bit, selling at $11,500 is still significantly more profitable than John's offer of $10,000."
