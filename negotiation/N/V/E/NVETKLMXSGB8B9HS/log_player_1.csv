Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $12,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000), giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There is space for both you and Bob to make counteroffers without reaching an impasse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. It's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,000 is better than selling to John for $8,000, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's split the difference and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```
 
I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still above my minimum and leaving room for further negotiation. This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to be flexible but also that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10000. That's the lowest I can go, but I'm really interested in making this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, Bob's offer is very close to my desired price point, and it's significantly better than selling to John.  I'm confident that I won't get a better offer, so I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $10,000."
