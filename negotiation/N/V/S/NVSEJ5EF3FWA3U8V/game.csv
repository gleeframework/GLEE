"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth it.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $105 is still a bit of a stretch. Could you do it for $98? ",98.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $98 is still below what I need.  Let's split the difference and go with $101.  It's a fair compromise and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",101.0,Alice,5,
