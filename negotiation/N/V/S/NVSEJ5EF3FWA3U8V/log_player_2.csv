"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! My asking price is $115.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting price is too high. It's important to try and negotiate a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's asking price and even less than John's backup offer. Starting with a low counteroffer gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite & Direct:** Maintaining a polite and friendly tone encourages continued negotiation. 
* **Clear Intention:**  We clearly state our desired price, leaving no ambiguity."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Room to Negotiate:** Alice moved towards a middle ground, which is a positive sign. However, $105 is still above our target price and closer to John's offer.
* **Leverage Remaining:**  We have several rounds left to negotiate, and Alice seems open to finding a compromise. We can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $105 is still a bit of a stretch. Could you do it for $98? "",
""product_price"": 98
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're showing willingness to move up, but in smaller increments to signal our budget constraints.
* **Targeting Below $100:** Aiming for $98 keeps us well below John's offer and significantly under Alice's initial price. 
* **Positive Tone:** We maintain a friendly and appreciative tone to foster a cooperative negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $98 is still below what I need.  Let's split the difference and go with $101.  It's a fair compromise and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $101 is just above our target price, but it's a significant saving compared to both Alice's initial offer and John's price. 
* **Limited Time:** We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds, and continuing to push for a few dollars difference might make Alice less willing to negotiate. 
* **Good Deal Overall:** This price represents a fair compromise and ensures we get the product within our budget."
