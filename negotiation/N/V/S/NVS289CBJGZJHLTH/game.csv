"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value it holds, but I believe I can't afford $14000 at the moment. Would you consider lowering the price to $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel that $13000 is out of my budget. Could you possibly lower the price further? I'm hoping for something closer to $10000 if possible.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I can offer it to you for $11500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that you're a serious buyer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the effort you've put into trying to find a price that works for both of us. I would like to propose $10000 as the final price for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the point where I may need to consider other buyers. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $11250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me there.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal and am willing to accept $11000 as the final price for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11000, but I'm still not getting close enough to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $12000. I can offer it to you for $11500. This is my absolute last offer, and I hope you can meet me there.",11500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to pay $11250 for the product. This is the highest amount I can reasonably offer based on my budget and the value I perceive in the product.",11250.0,Bob,10,
