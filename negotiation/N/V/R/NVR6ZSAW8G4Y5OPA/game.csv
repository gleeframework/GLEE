"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. It's still a significant amount, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price reflects the significant value this product holds for you, while still allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's make this deal happen!",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'd like to try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $875,000? This price still reflects the value of the product to me, but I'd like to make sure we're both comfortable with the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
