Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired outcome ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the benefit to Bob by mentioning the product's worth to him.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm prepared to potentially negotiate further, but I want to establish a strong starting point. 
* **John as a safety net:** I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I can walk away if the negotiations don't reach a satisfactory point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. It's still a significant amount, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $850,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), I'm still confident I can get a better deal. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I believe I can potentially get closer to $950,000 by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer as a fallback:**  I can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Bob fail, ensuring I don't settle for a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price reflects the significant value this product holds for you, while still allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:** I reiterate the value the product holds for Bob, making the price seem more reasonable.
* **Strong closing:**  I use a positive and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to accept. 

This counteroffer balances my desire for a higher price with the need to keep the negotiations moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'd like to try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $875,000? This price still reflects the value of the product to me, but I'd like to make sure we're both comfortable with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $75,000 less than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Limited room for improvement:** Further negotiation may not yield a significantly better price, especially considering Bob's insistence on $875,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject his offer, there's a chance he might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer, which is lower.

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option.  It ensures a profitable sale while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
