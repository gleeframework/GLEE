"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6500 is simply too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but I'm willing to come down a bit to $7500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $7500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $7000? I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done, but I need to stay within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
