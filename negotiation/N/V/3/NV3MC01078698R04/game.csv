"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  The product looks great, but $130 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115.  How does that sound?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $107?",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle on $112? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  I could go up to $109, but that's my absolute limit.",109.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $109 is still too far below my minimum price. I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $118. If you're not able to reach that price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  I'm confident you'll find this product valuable, and I hope we can find a way to make this work.",118.0,Alice,7,
