"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), but still below my minimum ($120). This gives Bob a good incentive to negotiate, while also allowing me to potentially secure a good price in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value of $120. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than that, and I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get at least $110 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm still trying to get a higher price than Bob's initial offer, but I'm also being reasonable and coming down from my initial offer. I'm confident that with a little more negotiation, we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my preferred price. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get a better deal with Bob. I have 6 rounds left, and John is still an option if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit low. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

I'm still trying to get as close to my minimum price as possible while keeping the negotiation going. Splitting the difference is a good way to show that I'm willing to work with Bob and find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to consider $106.50. That's the closest we've gotten so far, and I'd like to try to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm getting closer to my minimum price, and Bob is showing clear willingness to compromise. Accepting this offer ensures a deal with Bob,  while still getting a price that's reasonably close to my minimum. The risk of continuing negotiation and potentially failing to reach an agreement with Bob is greater than the potential gain from a higher price."
