,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is still a little below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a little further, but $92 just isn't quite there yet.  How about we settle on $93? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal.",93.0,Alice,5,
