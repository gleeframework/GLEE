"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance your business operations. Given its value to you, I propose an initial offer of $950,000 for the product. This price reflects not only its market value but also the strategic advantage it offers to you. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer and for explaining the product's value. I'm very interested, but $950,000 is a bit high for my budget right now. Would you consider $725,000?"", ""product_price"": 725000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming low:** Starting with a significantly lower offer (around 75% of Alice's initial offer) leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Staying realistic:**  While I want to save money, I'm  keeping my offer within a potentially acceptable range for Alice, considering her product's worth to her is $800,000.
* **Polite and professional:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your current budget constraints. In light of this, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $875,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our initial offer and your proposed counteroffer, aiming to provide value while accommodating your financial considerations. I appreciate your patience and flexibility in this matter.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is moving closer to her minimum acceptable price, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'll continue to counter-offer strategically in hopes of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and to the point:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly Alice's known value for the product. This is a strong negotiating tactic, as it signals that I'm well-informed and serious about closing the deal at a specific price point.
* **Sense of fairness:** By framing it as a ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm appealing to a sense of compromise and mutual benefit, which can encourage Alice to accept.
* **Calculated risk:** There's a chance Alice might reject this offer, hoping to squeeze out a bit more. However, the risk is relatively low, considering I'm already close to my maximum budget and significantly below John's offer."
