,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less.  How about $8,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. How about $8,750?  That's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $8,750 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a little bit more. Let's split the difference and go with $8,875.  I think that's a fair compromise that will allow us to both walk away happy.",8875.0,Alice,5,
