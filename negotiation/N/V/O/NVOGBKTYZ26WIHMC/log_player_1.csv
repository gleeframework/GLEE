Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less.  How about $8,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. How about $8,750?  That's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,750 is getting closer to my goal, I'm still not quite there. I'll counter with a price that's still slightly higher than his offer, but a bit lower than my previous counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $8,750 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a little bit more. Let's split the difference and go with $8,875.  I think that's a fair compromise that will allow us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8875}
