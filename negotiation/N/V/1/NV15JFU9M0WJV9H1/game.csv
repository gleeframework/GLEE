"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you'll be getting a quality product for a fair price, and I'll be able to move it quickly. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This price is fair for both of us, allowing you to sell it quickly and me to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price and offer you the product for $950,000.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  I'm confident you'll find a buyer at this price, and it's still a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $900,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer you the product for $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's finalize this agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
