{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you'll be getting a quality product for a fair price, and I'll be able to move it quickly. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** The message emphasizes the ""win-win"" aspect of the deal.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to discussing the price further.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob accepts:** I've successfully sold the product.
* **Bob rejects:** I will analyze his counteroffer and consider whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This price is fair for both of us, allowing you to sell it quickly and me to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's an improvement from his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, so I can afford to be firm with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,200,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price and offer you the product for $950,000.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above his initial price. 
* **Maintaining a strong position:** I'm still firm in my desire to get a price closer to my minimum.
* **Focusing on the deal's benefit:**  I emphasize the value of the product and how the offer is beneficial for both of us.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  I'm confident you'll find a buyer at this price, and it's still a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's getting closer, $900,000 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of losing John:**  I don't want to risk losing John by getting too close to Bob's offer. 
* **Room for improvement:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price and get closer to my desired target.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send Bob another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  I'll try to convince him that it's still a good deal, highlighting the value of the product and the potential benefits of this agreement."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $900,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer you the product for $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (again):** This counteroffer is a further compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's latest one. 
* **Balancing firmness and compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but I'm still holding firm to a price above Bob's last offer.
* **Emphasizing the deal's benefits:** I reiterate that this is a good deal for Bob, stressing the value of the product and the chance to finalize the agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob accepts:** Great! I've successfully sold the product.
* **Bob rejects:**  I'll need to carefully consider whether to continue negotiating with Bob or to sell the product to John.  If I continue with Bob, I'll need to think about a potential final offer that's still acceptable to me."
