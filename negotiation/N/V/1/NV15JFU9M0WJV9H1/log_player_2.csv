**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $925,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.
* You have already made multiple counteroffers and Alice is not budging significantly.
* It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a price lower than $925,000.
* To save money and avoid further negotiations, it's best to buy from John for $800,000."
