"Bob, I have a very unique product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  It's a one-time opportunity, so let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective.  $1200000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price considering the unique value of this product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1350000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $1275000? I'm confident that's a fair price for this product.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1275000 is still a bit low for me.  To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to go down to $1300000.  This is a good compromise that will allow us both to walk away happy.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1275000, but I'd like to throw in a condition: I'd like a 5% discount if I decide to buy the product. So, the total price would be $1225000. Can you consider that?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your need for a discount, but $1225000 is simply not enough for me. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we agree on $1250000. That's a fair compromise considering the unique value of this product. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
