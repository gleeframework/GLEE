"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, there's still room for negotiation.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a great starting point. I'm interested, but I'd need to see it closer to $900,000 to make it work for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into acquiring it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but I still believe I can get a better price.  Rejecting again allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my target of $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $910,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 910000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $910,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $915,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $915,000, which is very close to my target of $900,000.  At this point, it's a good deal for me, saving me $85,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might get me closer to my goal, but it could also risk losing the deal altogether.  It's time to accept and secure the product."
