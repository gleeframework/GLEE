"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is better than $1,200,000, it's still above Bob's maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range that might be acceptable. This establishes a clear starting point for negotiation and shows Bob's intent to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still above Bob's ideal price but is close enough to John's offer that it makes sense to accept.  There's a good chance that continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will walk away, and Bob will be forced to buy from John at $1,000,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the deal with Alice, even with a slightly higher price."
