"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset.  My starting price is $1,150,000.  Let's discuss how this can be a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better price. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1050000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, it's still above the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  I have 8 rounds remaining, which gives me room to negotiate a better price with Bob.  There's a good chance I can get him to pay closer to my initial price or even higher with further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Your offer is a starting point, but I need to stay closer to my original value proposition.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This gives you a significant discount and still allows me to realize the value of this product.  Let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1100000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a more substantial discount. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000? This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product at a good price while ensuring you still get a reasonable return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I've only had four rounds, and I have six more chances to negotiate. I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value of this product.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,087,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product at a good price while ensuring I still get a reasonable return.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1087500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1070000.  This reflects a significant discount for me while still allowing you to secure a good price. Let's make this final offer and close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are at round 6, and Bob's offer of $1,070,000 is only $70,000 less than my initial offer.  Given that we've been going back and forth, and I've only got 4 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly likely that I'll need to accept John's offer if I continue rejecting Bob.  I've secured a higher price than John's offer, so accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision at this point."
