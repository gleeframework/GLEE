""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $22,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you start with a strong position. Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Gauging interest:**  This offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you've secured a great deal. If he negotiates, you can determine how serious he is.
* **Room for negotiation:** The price is negotiable.  You can always come down, but you can't go up from your initial offer.  

**Important:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially lower the price if he seems hesitant. Remember, any price above $15,000 is a win for you!"
