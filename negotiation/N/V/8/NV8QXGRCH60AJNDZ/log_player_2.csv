"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is cheaper than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get the price lower by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you want to save as much as possible, offering $130 is a good starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's offer, showing you're serious about negotiating, but it's still within the range of what's likely acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $145, which is only $5 more than your counteroffer of $140. It's still within your budget and only slightly higher than your initial target. Continuing to negotiate might save a few more dollars, but the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away, forcing you to buy from John at $150, is too high. Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
