# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you that I believe will be of great value. I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true market value, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is below your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller offering a better deal."
