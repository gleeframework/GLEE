"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $95 is above your maximum budget of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation, as Alice is willing to sell for $80, and you're willing to pay up to $150. 
* **John is a backup:** John provides a safety net, but it's not ideal due to the higher price. 

By rejecting the initial offer, you open the possibility of securing a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  A counteroffer of $85 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $95, demonstrating your serious interest in the product but also setting a lower price point.
* **Fair compromise:** $85 is still higher than Alice's minimum of $80, suggesting a willingness to negotiate, but closer to your preferred price range.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for potential back and forth without immediately resorting to the backup option of John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** $100 is still above your desired price range, even though it's a slight decrease from the first offer.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. 
* **John is still a backup:** You can still buy from John, but it's still your least preferred option.

Rejecting the offer allows you to continue trying to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer is halfway between your previous offer of $85 and Alice's current offer of $100.
* **Showing commitment:**  It demonstrates your willingness to compromise and move closer to Alice's price.
* **Still within budget:**  $90 is still within your maximum budget of $150.

This counteroffer is a reasonable step towards finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $105 is more than your ideal price range, and the negotiations seem to be going up instead of down.
* **John is still a backup:** While you prefer to buy from Alice, John's offer is becoming more attractive.
* **Potential for stalemate:** The negotiations seem to be stuck, with Alice unwilling to lower her price much further.

Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer, potentially bringing the price down, or to consider buying from John as a more appealing alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her offer of $105 and your previous offer of $90.
* **Close to your limit:** While still above your ideal price, $95 is closer to your maximum budget and might be acceptable.
* **Final negotiation:** This is likely your last chance to negotiate with Alice before potentially buying from John.

This counteroffer shows your commitment to finding a deal while also pushing for a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $110 is significantly over your desired price range and your maximum budget of $150.
* **Negotiations stalled:** Alice's counteroffers have been increasing, indicating she is not willing to negotiate further.
* **John is the better option:**  John's offer of $150 is a safer choice at this point, guaranteeing you the product without risking further negotiation with Alice.

Buying from John ensures a purchase while minimizing potential losses."
