"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
