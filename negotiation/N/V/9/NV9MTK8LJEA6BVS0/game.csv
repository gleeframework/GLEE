"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not sure I'm willing to pay that high of a price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd need to get to $950,000 to feel good about the deal. Can we discuss further?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to get at least $1,000,000 for this product. This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
