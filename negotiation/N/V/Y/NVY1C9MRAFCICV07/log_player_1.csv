Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is substantial. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,100,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal.

Bob is firmly rooted at $1,100,000 and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
