Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $900000 is still above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $750000. This reflects the value I see in the product, but also allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
