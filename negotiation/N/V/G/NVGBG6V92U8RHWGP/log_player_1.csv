Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, I'm hoping for a better deal. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? That's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,000. That's fair for both of us, and it gets us both to our goals. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, this is a fair deal and it gets me to my goal of at least $10,000.  It's better than selling to John for the same amount, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob altogether."
