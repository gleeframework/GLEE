I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product. This gives me some room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer, while also ensuring I don't immediately lose the deal. I'm also being positive and friendly in my message to encourage a smooth negotiation."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
