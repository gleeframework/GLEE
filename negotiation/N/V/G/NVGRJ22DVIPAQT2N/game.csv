"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering $900000 for the product. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so my counteroffer is $1050000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway from your initial offer, but I still think it's a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's my maximum. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your maximum offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous counteroffer, so my new offer is $1025000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $975000, but that's my final offer. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider that?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1050000. I'm starting to think that we might be too far apart on the price. However, I'm still interested in selling the product to you, so I'm willing to make one more concession. My final offer is $1025000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so my final counteroffer is $987500. That's the best I can do. Can you consider that?",987500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet on price. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My final counteroffer is $1050000 is too low, so I'm going to go back to my initial offer and add a small buffer. My new offer is $1100000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",1100000.0,Alice,9,
