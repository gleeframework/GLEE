"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way outside my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for a product like this. Would you be willing to come down significantly?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I could potentially go up to $10,000 if that works for you?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the offer, but I need to get a bit more for it to make sense for me.  How about $14,000 and we have a deal?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair offer, considering your initial asking price and my budget.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $15,000.  I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need to get as close to that number as possible. How about $13,000, and we close this deal out?",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another offer, but $13,000 is still pushing it for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",11500.0,Bob,8,
