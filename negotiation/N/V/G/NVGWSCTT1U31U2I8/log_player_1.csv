Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way outside my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for a product like this. Would you be willing to come down significantly?

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair offer, considering your initial asking price and my budget.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have another offer, but $13,000 is still pushing it for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

Bob is unlikely to move much higher and we're getting too far from John's offer. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed $15,000."
