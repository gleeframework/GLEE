"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on a unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $100. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $115, which is as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. My final offer is $105. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to move on to other options.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your final offer is $105, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $105, which would be $110. It's my last offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $110 is still above my budget. My final offer stands at $105. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",105.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your final offer, but I'm not willing to accept it. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one last offer: $112.50. It's the lowest I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",112.5,Alice,9,
