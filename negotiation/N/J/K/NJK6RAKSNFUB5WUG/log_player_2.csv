"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($10,000).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $12,000? It's still a good price for you, and I'd be happy to take it off your hands."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would still give you a good deal, and I'd be happy to get this product into your hands. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $13,000**. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he's willing to pay up to $15,000.
* **Rejecting and making another counteroffer might risk Alice walking away.**  While a lower price is ideal, there's no guarantee she'll accept. 
* **Buying from John for $15,000 is a worse deal.**

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $13,000 saves Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John, making it the best option in this situation."
