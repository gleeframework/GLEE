Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is more than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $14,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000), making it a potentially appealing offer for him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You have room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price.

This strategy allows you to:

* **Maximize your profit:**  You're aiming for the highest possible price while still remaining attractive to Bob.
* **Maintain flexibility:** You can adjust your price if needed based on Bob's response. 
* **Have a backup option:** You can always sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $12,000? It's still a good price for you, and I'd be happy to take it off your hands. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer. It's worth pushing for a higher price, as Bob clearly values the product.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can send a counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would still give you a good deal, and I'd be happy to get this product into your hands."", ""product_price"": 13000}
