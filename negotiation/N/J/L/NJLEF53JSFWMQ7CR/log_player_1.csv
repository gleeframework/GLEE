Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a good compromise:** It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows that I'm confident in the value of my product.
* **It gives Bob room to counteroffer:** This keeps the negotiation open and avoids a quick ""no"" from him. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and my options (negotiating further, or selling to John for $8,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer him with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still confident the product is worth more. How about $10,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$9,000 is a good compromise and is close to my desired price.  I'm not sure if I can get more from Bob, and selling to John for $8,000 would be a less profitable outcome."
