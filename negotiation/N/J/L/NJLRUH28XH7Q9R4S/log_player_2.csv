"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its immense value to you, we believe it's only fair to offer it at a price that reflects its true worth and significance to you. We propose to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This offer is exclusive to you and represents a significant saving compared to the market value of $1,500,000. We are confident this price will not only ensure a mutually beneficial transaction but also allow us to maximize the value of our product for you. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. We look forward to the possibility of working together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice is trying to maximize her profit. Her flowery language about ""value to you"" and ""mutually beneficial transaction"" is designed to make you feel good about paying a high price.
* **Your Alternatives:** You have a fallback option with John at $1,500,000. This means Alice's offer, while lower, isn't your only choice.
* **Negotiation Power:** By rejecting Alice's first offer, you signal that you're a serious buyer but not willing to overpay. There's a good chance she'll come back with a lower price to avoid losing the sale entirely.

**Strategy:**  Rejecting this offer opens the door for further negotiation. You can aim to get the price closer to, or even below, $1,000,000."
