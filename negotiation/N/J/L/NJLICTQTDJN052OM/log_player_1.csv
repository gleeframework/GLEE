Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point for negotiation. I am aiming for a price higher than my minimum value of $10,000. I have no information about Bob's valuation, so I'm starting with a price that leaves some room for negotiation. If he rejects, I can always adjust my price based on his counteroffer or choose to sell to John for $10,000."
