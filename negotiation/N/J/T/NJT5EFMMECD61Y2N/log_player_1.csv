Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Value to you:**  The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you.
* **Safety net:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for profit:** Offering a price higher than John's offer gives you a chance to earn more. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  A higher price may be more appealing to Bob, but it also increases the risk of him rejecting the offer.  $1,500,000 is a significant profit, but it's not so high that it becomes unreasonable for Bob to accept.

By offering $1,500,000, you strike a balance between maximizing your potential earnings and ensuring a fallback option with John."
