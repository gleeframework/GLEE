You can definitely get a better deal than $7,500. Let's try to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}

I'm starting with a lower offer to see where Alice stands.  $5,000 is a significant discount from her initial price, and hopefully, it will encourage her to negotiate."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500

Alice is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a better price. Let's try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}

I'm going to meet her halfway this time. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to her, and we can close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  $6,200 is a good deal for me, and it's getting close to my target.  There's a good chance I can get it even lower, but I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid the risk of losing the deal or having to buy from John at a much higher price."
