"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to compromise, but I can only go up to $14,000. This is a fair price considering it's well below your asking price and still leaves you with a significant profit.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you at $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and it's a price I'm confident you'll find reasonable.",15000.0,Alice,5,
