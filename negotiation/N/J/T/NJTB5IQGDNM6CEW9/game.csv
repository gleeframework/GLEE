"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, I'm confident the product's value to you warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but I can't go lower than that. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
