Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already said I'd go up to $115, and I'm not willing to go any higher. However, I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as high as I'll go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower. Accepting $110 is a decent compromise, saving $40 from John's price.  Continuing to negotiate might backfire and lead to losing the deal altogether."
