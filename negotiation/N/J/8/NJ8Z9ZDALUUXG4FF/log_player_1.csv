I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value.  This is to leave room for negotiation, but it's still a price that I'm comfortable with.  I know Bob values the product at $8,000, so I'm hoping to get a price somewhere in between."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but it's still lower than I'd like. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a price we both agree on."

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering a price of $10,500. This is still above my minimum, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for Bob to accept, while also getting me closer to the value I'm looking for."

Bob's latest offer is getting too close to my minimum.  It's not worth risking further negotiation at this point, and I'm confident I can get my desired price from John."
