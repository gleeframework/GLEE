# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I will reject Alice's offer because it's too high. I can get the product from John for $1,200,000, which is a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a significant discount from her initial offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,000,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's new offer of $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to meet her halfway between her last offer and my initial counteroffer. I'll offer $1,150,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm still not quite there at $1,150,000.  Considering the product's value to you,  how about we settle at $1,200,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us both to walk away satisfied.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I think I've already made it clear that I'm not willing to pay more than $1,200,000. Since Alice's offer is at the same price as John's offer, I'll just confirm that I'm willing to buy the product from John for $1,200,000 and there's no need to negotiate further with Alice.
