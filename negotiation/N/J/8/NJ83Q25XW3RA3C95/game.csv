"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,000,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I'm still not quite there at $1,150,000.  Considering the product's value to you,  how about we settle at $1,200,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to pay more than $1,200,000. I'll be buying the product from John at this price, so I'm ending the negotiation with you.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
