"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we settle at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but I think I can do better than that. How about $8,750?",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $8,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to do $8,250.  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",8250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $8,250, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment. How about we do $8,375? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a bit of a concession to get the deal done.",8375.0,Alice,7,
