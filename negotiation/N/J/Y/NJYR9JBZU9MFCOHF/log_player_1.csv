"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $80 is far below my minimum price, and I'm confident I can get a better offer from him or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $120?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a fair price."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I could go up to $95, how does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's better than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum price.  I believe I can get closer to my goal with further negotiation or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $95 is still too low. I'm willing to go down to $110. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $100 is the absolute highest I can go. How about we make it a deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $100 is not my ideal price, it's the best offer I've received from Bob so far. It's also important to note that we only have 4 rounds left, and selling to John will only net me $50 more.  I'd rather lock in a sale now than risk losing out on a deal altogether."
