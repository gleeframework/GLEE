"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $120?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a fair price.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I could go up to $95, how does that sound?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $95 is still too low. I'm willing to go down to $110. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $100 is the absolute highest I can go. How about we make it a deal at that price?",100.0,Bob,6,
