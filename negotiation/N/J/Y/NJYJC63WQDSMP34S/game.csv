"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to compromise further.
