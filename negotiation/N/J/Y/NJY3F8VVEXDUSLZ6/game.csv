"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, how about $1,250,000?  Let's find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1,162,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make.",1162500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we need to find a compromise. Your last offer is a bit too high for me. I can do $1,143,750. This keeps us close to the middle ground and feels like a fair deal.",1143750.0,Bob,6,
