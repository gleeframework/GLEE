Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account the information given:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have leverage to start high.  A price of $1,200,000 aims for a significant profit margin.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and emphasizing the ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price, even though you know Bob values it at $800,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can always come down in price, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $800,000.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is very price-sensitive or dislikes aggressive negotiation tactics, you might start with a slightly lower offer.
* **Market Information:** While not provided in the prompt, real-world scenarios often involve understanding market trends. If similar products regularly sell above $800,000, you have even more leverage."
