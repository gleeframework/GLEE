"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Can you meet me in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it a great value.",95.0,Alice,3,
