# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price just for you. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $12,000 and higher than the product's worth to Alice of $8,000. This indicates a potential deal where both parties benefit. Accepting the offer allows you to save $2,000 compared to buying from John."
