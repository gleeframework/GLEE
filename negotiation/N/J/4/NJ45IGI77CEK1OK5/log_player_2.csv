"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a significant amount to me, and I know it holds great value for you as well.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  There are 9 rounds left, so there is time to explore a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price.  While $900,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's try to find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price, but still higher than what he's willing to pay. There are still 7 rounds left, and Bob has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product for me, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
