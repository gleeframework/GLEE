{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for 1100000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my target, it's still above what I'm willing to pay right now.  I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a price closer to my goal of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as 1050000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for 1080000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I could continue to try and negotiate further, it's likely she won't budge much more.  Accepting her offer at $1,080,000 saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John, and it's worth the potential risk of not getting a slightly lower price."
