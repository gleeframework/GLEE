Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 10000} 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but still gives me a profit. I believe this is a fair starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm countering with $9,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I believe this shows good faith and increases the chances of a deal being reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,200. While it's still below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum value and the negotiations have been going back and forth. It's likely that further negotiation would only lead to a longer process, and I'm comfortable with this deal."
