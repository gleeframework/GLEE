**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** Even though you could save an additional $1,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John, it's still a better deal to accept Alice's offer and pay $14,000. 
* **Your goal is to save money.** While you could potentially get a better deal by waiting, there's no guarantee that a better offer will come along. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price."
