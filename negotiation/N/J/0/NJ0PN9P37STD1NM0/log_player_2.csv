"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. Given your expertise in [mention Bob's relevant expertise], I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a price that reflects the true worth of the product, and I'm certain it will be a valuable asset for your endeavors. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly stating the product's maximum value to you ($1,000,000) and her desire to get that full price. You have nothing to lose by rejecting her offer.  You can always buy from John at the same price, but there's a chance Alice might come down on her price if you reject her initial offer."
