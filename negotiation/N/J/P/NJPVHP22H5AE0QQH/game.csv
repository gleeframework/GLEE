"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get it a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $11,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",11250.0,Alice,5,
