"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,200,000 is significantly below the value I see in my product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a figure closer to $1,700,000 to make this work. This price still leaves room for you to profit and reflects the true worth of the product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering our respective positions.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
