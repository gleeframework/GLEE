"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Would you like to make an offer to purchase it for $1800000?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to stay within my budget of $800000 as a maximum.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to negotiate further. However, I'm afraid $1200000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. Would you be willing to consider $1600000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $1600000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my target of $800000. How about $1200000 is too low, what about $1400000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1500000?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1500000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'd like to propose $1000000. I'm willing to walk away if this isn't acceptable to you.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
