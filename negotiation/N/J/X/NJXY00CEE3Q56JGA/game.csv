"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a price of $950,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its true value to you is $1,000,000.  I'm confident you'll find this offer compelling, but if you decline, I've already secured a buyer willing to pay $800,000. Let me know your decision at your earliest convenience.",950000.0,Alice,1,
