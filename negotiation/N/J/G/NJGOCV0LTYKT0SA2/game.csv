"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'll sell the product to you for $1,400,000. This is my final offer for now.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need $1,300,000 to make it worth my while. This is my last offer, and I'm not budging from here.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
