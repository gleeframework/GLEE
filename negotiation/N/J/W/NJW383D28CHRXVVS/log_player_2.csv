{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and Alice's initial offer is above his maximum price point of $120.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and proceeding to a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible, so he starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  $100 is a good starting point as it's well below his maximum price of $120, but still leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price point.  He's offering a price that's still below what he'd pay John, but higher than his previous offer. This shows Alice he's serious about buying but still wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $120, but it's very close. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  It's a gamble, as he's running out of rounds, but a slightly lower counteroffer could still be successful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is Bob's final attempt to get the product for his maximum price. He's offering his absolute limit, knowing he can always go to John if Alice doesn't accept. It's a high-stakes move, but potentially worth the risk as he only has a few rounds left."
