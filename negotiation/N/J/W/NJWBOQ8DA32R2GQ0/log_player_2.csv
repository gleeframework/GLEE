You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can potentially get a better price than $800,000 from her."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer given the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.

It's still worth trying to negotiate further. You can likely get a price closer to your $800,000 target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate you getting closer to my price.  $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $925,000, but this is my final offer.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $925,000 is closer to your budget, it's still a bit higher than the $800,000 you can get from John. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a higher price. Buying from John ensures you get the product within your budget."
