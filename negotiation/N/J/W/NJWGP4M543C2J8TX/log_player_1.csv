Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $115. I think you'll find it's a great deal for a product of this quality."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) but above my minimum ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason for the price (even if vague about ""quality"") can make it feel more justified to Bob.
* **Alternative:** I'm keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer (John) at $100. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'm ready to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is above my minimum, I think there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer wasn't drastically lower, suggesting he's still interested. I'll try to meet him halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I can see you're serious about this. How about we meet in the middle at $110? "", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that often feels fair to both parties. 
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $110 is still a $10 profit for me, which is a good outcome. 
* **Pressure:** By not going lower immediately, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell at any price."
