You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better deal than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $10,000.  Offering $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to profit. This counteroffer is a starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price range, it's still higher than the $10,500 counteroffer that Bob made in the previous round.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4

{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a good deal. Offering $10,750 is a compromise between the previous offer and Alice's last offer, showing flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement."
