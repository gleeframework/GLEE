# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is an exceptional value considering its worth to you is $15,000. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I would like to propose a price of $11,000. This allows some room for both of us to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price, and still above Alice's minimum value. Accepting this offer secures the product at a favorable price."
