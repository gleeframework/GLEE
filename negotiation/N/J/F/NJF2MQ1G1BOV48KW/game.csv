"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable and mutually beneficial price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between our valuations is still quite significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and its potential for future growth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
