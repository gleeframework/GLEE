Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant return you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and offering it for slightly less than its value to me ($1,200,000) still yields a significant profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Since Bob values the product at $800,000, offering it at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying above his perceived value.
* **John as Backup:** Having a guaranteed buyer in John ensures I won't be forced to go below my minimum acceptable price.

**This strategy aims to:**

1. **Secure a deal with Bob:** By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, I increase the chances of Bob countering with a price that's still highly profitable for me.
2. **Maintain a strong position:** By emphasizing the product's value and my firm stance on price, I demonstrate its worth and encourage Bob to meet my offer."
