{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's closer to the $1,000,000 I'd pay John than to my ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000, reflecting a compromise on both our sides. This price still leaves significant value for you, and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Please consider this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While she has lowered her price, it's still closer to John's price than my desired price. I'm still willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still too steep for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $875,000 for the product. This price is fair to both of us, and allows us to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 still falls short of my minimum acceptable price.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway and offer the product for $887,500.  This price reflects a significant compromise on my end, and allows for a fair and mutually beneficial deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is getting closer to my ideal price, and it's significantly lower than John's price.  It's a good compromise, and I'm confident I can't get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's time to secure the product."
