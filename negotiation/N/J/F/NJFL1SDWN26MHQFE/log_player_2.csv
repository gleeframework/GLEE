"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product, but I need to make a profit, so I'm asking $140. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $140. You can get the same product from John for $100, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
