# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer.**  You would pay $1,350,000 to Alice, which is less than the $1,500,000 you would pay to John.
* **You are trying to save money.** Accepting Alice's offer means you save $150,000."
