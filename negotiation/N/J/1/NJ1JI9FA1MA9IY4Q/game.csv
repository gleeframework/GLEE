"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit steep at $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for countering. While $900,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is far greater, especially for someone with your vision.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the product's potential and provides a fair outcome for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective on the price. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,100,000? This recognizes the value of the product while acknowledging your offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to accepting, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
