{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with its potential.  I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I think this represents a fair deal given its potential worth to you. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price ($1,450,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob. It's a price that allows you to potentially earn more while still exceeding your minimum acceptable amount. 
* **Open Communication:** The message aims to start a conversation and invites Bob to negotiate, leaving room for a potentially even higher sale price."
