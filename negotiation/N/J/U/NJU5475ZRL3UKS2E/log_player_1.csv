Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that you are serious about selling the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than the value the product holds for him and leaves you with less profit.  It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from your initial offer. It still leaves room for further negotiation but shows you're willing to work towards a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price and significantly higher than John's offer.  It's a reasonable compromise to ensure a sale and avoid further negotiation."
