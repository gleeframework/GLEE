"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us and allows for a successful transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's settle on $1,275,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
