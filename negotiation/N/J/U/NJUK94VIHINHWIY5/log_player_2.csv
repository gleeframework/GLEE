"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price, potentially saving more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us and allows for a successful transaction."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's settle on $1,275,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, and $1,275,000 is a price that is within Bob's budget and still represents a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,500,000.  It's a reasonable compromise that allows Bob to secure the product without overspending."
