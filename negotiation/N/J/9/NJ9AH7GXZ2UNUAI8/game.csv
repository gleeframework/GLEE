"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to negotiate a better price. Can you meet me halfway?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $800,000? That way, we both get a fair deal. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,3,
