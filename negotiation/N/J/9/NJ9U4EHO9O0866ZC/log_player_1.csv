Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to come down to $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Since Bob's offer of $8,000 is equal to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option 1.
