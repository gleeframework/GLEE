"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to make another adjustment. How about we meet at $107.50? It's still a bit above your initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",107.5,Alice,5,
