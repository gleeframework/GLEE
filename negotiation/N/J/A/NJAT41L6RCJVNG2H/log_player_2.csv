# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,600,000. I know it's a valuable asset to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still being fair. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested party willing to pay $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for a lower price."
