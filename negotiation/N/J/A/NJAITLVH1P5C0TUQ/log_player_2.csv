"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice's initial offer of $180 is too high.  It's best to reject the offer and see if you can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above my personal value of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully find a price we can both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $160 is only $10 more than my personal value of $150. While I'd prefer to pay less, accepting this offer is a good compromise.  I'm not sure I can get a better price in the remaining rounds, and I'm also risking losing the deal to John."
