"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the extra $2,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell it for $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. If you can come down to that price, I'll take it off your hands.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $10,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $10,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll be happy to make the deal. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
