"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** Buying from Alice for $12,000 is cheaper than buying from John for $15,000.
* **Alice still makes a profit:**  Alice values the product at $8,000, so selling it for $12,000 is a good deal for her. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice for Bob to save money."
