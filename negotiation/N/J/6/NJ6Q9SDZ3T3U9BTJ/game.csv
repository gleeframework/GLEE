"Alice, your initial offer is much higher than what I'm willing to pay. Given my budget constraints and the product's value to me, I'm offering $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price, reflecting both our interests.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product and the potential return on investment it offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,950,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  Let's continue to work towards a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably spend. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000.  This price represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I respect your position, but we need to find a price point that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a substantial compromise on my end while still reflecting the true value of this product.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort, but $1,550,000 remains out of my budget. To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm offering $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll accept it.  We both know the product is valuable, and I believe this price reflects a fair balance between our respective needs.",1350000.0,Bob,8,
