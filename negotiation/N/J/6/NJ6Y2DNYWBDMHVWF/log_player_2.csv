It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price, especially when you have a clear alternative.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer of $500,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it shows that I'm serious about getting a good deal. It's likely that Alice will counter with a price higher than this, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

$600,000 is still a bit high. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial counteroffer."

I'm going to increase my offer to $550,000. This is a compromise, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate while staying within my budget."

I'm still aiming for a lower price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate."

Round 6

I'm going to meet Alice halfway at $600,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while staying within a reasonable price range."

$700,000 is still above my target, but it's getting closer. It's worth another round of counteroffers."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Alice's counteroffers are getting closer to her initial offer.  It's likely that she is not willing to go lower.  Given that we have only one round left and I have a guaranteed alternative with John,  I'm going to buy the product from John."
