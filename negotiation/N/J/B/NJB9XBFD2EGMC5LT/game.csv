"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product highly valuable. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,000, which would be $9,500. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm confident you won't regret this purchase.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
