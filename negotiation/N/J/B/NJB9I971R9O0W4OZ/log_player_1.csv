Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I believe it offers excellent value and would be a great purchase for you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below our minimum ($150). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes ""special price"" and ""excellent value"" to make the offer more appealing. 

If Bob rejects this offer, we can always sell to John for our minimum acceptable price."
