Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high initial offer, but it allows for room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer based on his response.  I also have the security of John's offer, so I'm not under pressure to accept anything less than $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a decent price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,250,000. This shows flexibility while still demonstrating that the product is worth more than Bob's initial offer.  It's a compromise that hopefully encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low.  I'll make another counteroffer.  While it's getting close to John's offer, I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob before settling for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

This is my final counteroffer. It's a significant drop from my initial asking price, but still above John's offer. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this final offer. If he doesn't, I'll have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I've already made several concessions. I'm not willing to go lower, so it's time to accept John's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  securing $1,000,000 is a solid outcome."
