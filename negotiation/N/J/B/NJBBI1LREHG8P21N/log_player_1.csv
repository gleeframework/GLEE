Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, but we're still too far apart. I'll hold firm on my price point for one more round and see if he's willing to budge closer to my last offer."

While not ideal, Bob has steadily increased his offer and we are now at $1,090,000. He's unlikely to go much higher and we are running out of rounds.  Accepting now secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
