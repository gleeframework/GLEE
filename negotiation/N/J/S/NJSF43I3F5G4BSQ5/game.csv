"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $8,000. Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $10,500. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $10,500 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we settle at $9,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit higher than you'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,5,
