Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward while still staying above John's offer.
* **Confident but Fair:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and presenting the offer as mutually beneficial. 

By starting at $925,000, Alice leaves space for Bob to counter-offer while ensuring a significant profit margin. Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, Alice is still likely to get a better price than John's $800,000 backup offer."
