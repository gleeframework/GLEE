"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000? It's a fair price considering the value of this product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I really think $1,250,000 is still too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go to $1,150,000. Can you consider that?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $1,150,000 is still too low. I understand you want a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $1,200,000? This is a fair compromise that leaves us both satisfied.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle anytime soon. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but that's my final offer. I'm not willing to pay more than that. Can you accept that?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
