"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,000 is too high:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. $9,000 is significantly higher than Alice's value of $8,000, meaning there's room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffer potential:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* **John's price is a backup:**  Knowing John is selling for $12,000 gives Bob a ceiling for his negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $9,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point, offering a price slightly lower than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $8,500 is still higher than Alice's value, but it gives Alice some room to negotiate without feeling pressured. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a friendly and professional tone, encouraging a continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** Alice's offer of $8,750 is a reasonable compromise and a significant decrease from her initial offer.
* **Close to Bob's target:** While slightly higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $8,500, $8,750 is still a good price for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $12,000.
* **Avoiding potential risk:**  Rejecting Alice's offer risks losing the deal. Even though a lower price is possible, there's no guarantee Alice will continue to negotiate, and Bob might end up paying John's higher price.

Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure a good deal within his budget and avoid the risk of a longer negotiation."
