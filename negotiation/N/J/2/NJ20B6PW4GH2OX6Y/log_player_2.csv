"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still too high. You can save a significant amount of money by negotiating further.
* You have 9 rounds left, giving you ample opportunity to reach a better price. 
* Buying from John immediately would be a waste of potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice.  $900,000 is a bit steep for me, but I'm interested.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still above your target price.  While it's closer, you can likely still get a better deal.
* You have 7 rounds left to continue negotiating. There's no need to rush into accepting an offer that's still too high.
* Buying from John now would mean losing a significant amount of potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $850,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $800,000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. This is already a compromise on my part, considering the product's worth to me is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. 
* You have already made a counteroffer of $800,000, and Alice has met you halfway with $825,000.
* While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or you may not be able to reach a better price. 
* Accepting this offer saves you $375,000 compared to buying from John. 
* With 5 rounds remaining, you still have time to explore other options if needed."
