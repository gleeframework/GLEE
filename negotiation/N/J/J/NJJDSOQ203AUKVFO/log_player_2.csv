"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that's significantly below its true worth.  While I value it at over $1,200,000, I'm willing to let it go for $1,000,000. This is a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to quickly move this product without impacting my bottom line.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I would like to {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}.

I think Alice's offer is still too high for me, and I can get the same product for $200,000 less from John."
