"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. I think it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer of $115. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $122.50. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",122.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $122.50 is still outside of my budget.  Let's split the difference at $118.75.  This would give us both a good deal.",118.75,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence too! I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $119.75. It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",119.75,Alice,7,
