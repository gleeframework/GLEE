Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a safety net. Offering the product to Bob at a higher price allows you to potentially gain an additional profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price of $15,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  It also positions the product as potentially more valuable in Bob's mind.
* **Clear and Direct Communication:**  The message is straightforward and emphasizes the value of the product without revealing your minimum acceptable price."
