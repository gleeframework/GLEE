"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I believe it's worth a significant investment. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum value. How about $1100000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we settle on $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is my absolute maximum.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that we've already negotiated for several rounds. Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've been thinking, Bob, and I'm willing to make one final concession. Considering we're very close to the maximum I'm willing to go, I'll meet you at $1050000, but only if you're willing to throw in a 5% bonus for me. This would bring the total to $1102500. Is this a deal you're willing to accept?",1102500.0,Alice,7,
