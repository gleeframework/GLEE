Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?"",

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I think $90 is a bit low. I can do $105, which is a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'll try to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $98?"",

This offer is a fair compromise and still allows me to save some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I think $98 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I can do $110, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

It seems Alice is unwilling to budge much further. Buying from John at $120 is more desirable than continuing to haggle for a potentially insignificant discount."
