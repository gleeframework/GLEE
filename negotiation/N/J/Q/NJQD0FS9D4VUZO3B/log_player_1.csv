Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $18,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he flat out rejects it, you can significantly lower the price. If he counters, you know he's serious and can negotiate from there.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale with John at $12,000, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially lower your price to reach a mutually agreeable deal."
