"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects the true value and potential it holds."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your target price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a deal significantly above your minimum. 
* **Anchoring:** A high initial price acts as an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even though he knows his valuation is lower, it can subtly influence his perception of what's a ""reasonable"" counteroffer.
* **Gauging Bob's Position:** This initial offer will likely be rejected, but it allows you to see how aggressively Bob counters. If he comes back close to your asking price, it might indicate he values it more than he's letting on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,300,000 is far too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is expectedly low, matching his stated valuation. Accepting this would be a significant loss. We have room to negotiate and should aim to get closer to our minimum selling price. Selling to John right now would be cutting negotiations short – there's potential to get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true market value. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** We're making a $300,000 decrease from our initial price. This shows Bob we're willing to negotiate while still reinforcing the product's value.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** We're still well above our $1,500,000 minimum and aiming to draw Bob closer to our range.
* **Positive Language:** We're maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $2,000,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's still within my budget. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, but $1,200,000 is still below our $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** We're not in a rush and still have negotiating rounds left. Rejecting this offer signals that we're serious about getting closer to our desired price range.
* **John as a Back-Up:** We can always fall back on selling to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob stall significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price.  To be candid, $1,200,000 is below what I can consider. Let's settle this right now – I'm prepared to make a significant move to $1,700,000. I believe this reflects the product's value while acknowledging your position. "",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a substantial $300,000 drop to show Bob we're serious about closing the deal. 
* **Above Minimum, But Room to Negotiate:** The $1,700,000 price point gives us some cushioning above our $1,500,000 floor, allowing for potential further negotiation if needed.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The language ""settle this right now""  aims to accelerate the negotiation and signal that we're nearing our final offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. It's a significant increase from my last offer and shows my good faith in wanting to reach a deal. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 exceeds our absolute minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Strong Counter:** This is a significant jump from his previous offer, indicating he's serious about closing the deal.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're past the halfway point in negotiations. While we could potentially push for more, the risk of Bob walking away increases. 
* **Solid Profit:**  A $1,400,000 sale price still represents a considerable profit, and it's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it entirely."
