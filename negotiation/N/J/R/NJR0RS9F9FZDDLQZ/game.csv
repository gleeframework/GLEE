,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $122.50 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $123.50, which is a fair compromise. This deal is beneficial for both of us, so let's close it.",123.5,Alice,5,
