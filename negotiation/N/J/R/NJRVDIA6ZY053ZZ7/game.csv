"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to let it go for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. This is my maximum offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is your maximum offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16000. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $14000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's try to find a compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $14000, but I'm willing to meet you at $15500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
