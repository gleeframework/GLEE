Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **The Sweet Spot:**  There's a potential profit margin between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 where both you and Bob could benefit.

**Offer Strategy**

You want to start high but leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. Aiming slightly below your guaranteed price with John is a good strategy.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is positive, highlighting the product's value.
* **Price:** The $1,450,000 price gives you a significant profit over your minimum while still being attractive to Bob if he values the product's unique qualities.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher to allow room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While John provides a safety net, exploring other potential buyers could increase your leverage.
