"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, it's still worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  I think that would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8500 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $9250?  This would still give you a good deal and allow me to get closer to my target price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, and $9,250 is a reasonable compromise.  It's still a good deal compared to buying from John for $12,000.  There's a chance Alice could come down further, but there's also a risk of her rejecting future offers and potentially leading to a stalemate. Accepting this offer secures a decent price within your budget."
