Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500?  I think that would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
