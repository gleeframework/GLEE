"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $8,000, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John for $12,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $9000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement quickly. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and we're already on round 4. There's a risk that if I reject his offer, he might walk away, or his next counteroffer might be even lower.  Accepting his offer now allows me to secure a deal that is significantly higher than his initial offer and still profitable for me. While selling to John for $12,000 would be ideal, the potential for a longer negotiation and the risk of losing Bob as a buyer make accepting his offer the best option at this point."
