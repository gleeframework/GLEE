"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,700,000. This reflects the product's quality and the substantial return on investment you can expect.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While the product is good, $1,700,000 is still too high for me. I could go up to $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a fair price.  However, to be transparent, I have other offers, and I can't sell this product for less than $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal given the value this product brings.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
