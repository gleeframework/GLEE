Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a fair price.  However, to be transparent, I have other offers, and I can't sell this product for less than $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal given the value this product brings.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $1,500,000.  While the product might be worth a slight premium, it's not worth going over your $1,200,000 limit when you have a guaranteed option with John."
