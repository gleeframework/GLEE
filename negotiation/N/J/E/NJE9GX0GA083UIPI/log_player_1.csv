"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my absolute minimum price, as I can always sell to John for this amount. This puts the pressure on Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$900,000 is far too low for me. I'm not going to settle for that, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  I'll counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway. I'm dropping my price slightly, but still keeping it significantly higher than his offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to negotiate further without pushing him to walk away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to what I'd like, it's still below my minimum. I'll continue to try and negotiate with Bob, hoping he'll come up higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm willing to drop my price again, but only to $1,050,000.  This is still a decent profit for me and hopefully enough to get Bob to seriously consider the deal.  I'm also running out of rounds, so I need to make progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, even though it's getting closer.  I'm going to continue negotiating, as I still have a few rounds left and I can always fall back on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm making one final concession to Bob, offering $1,025,000. This is still a good profit for me, but if he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached the point where Bob's offers are still too low for me, and I only have two rounds left. If I reject his offer, he might counter with something even lower, and I risk losing out on a better price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for my minimum price."
