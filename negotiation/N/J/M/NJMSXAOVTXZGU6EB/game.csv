"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $800000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $850000. This price reflects the unique value and potential of this product.  While I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment, I'm also open to discussing a slightly lower price if you're interested.  Let me know your thoughts!",850000.0,Alice,1,
