"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He's offering a price that's $1,500 lower than Alice's offer, which is still a good deal for both of them. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation but also demonstrates Bob's willingness to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be very valuable. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a good compromise.  While Bob would ideally like a lower price, $12,500 is still within his budget and a significant savings compared to buying from John. Accepting this offer secures the product for him at a favorable price."
