"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,125,000?  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise. Let's make this happen.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that. How about $1,075,000? I'm trying to stay within my budget and make this deal work.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1,075,000 is tempting, I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for its value.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,100,000.  This price allows you to secure a valuable asset while also being within my acceptable range.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I think I can do better. How about $1,050,000? I'm trying to get as close to my budget as possible while still making this deal work for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
