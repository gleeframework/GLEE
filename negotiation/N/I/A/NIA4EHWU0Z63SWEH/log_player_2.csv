Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $18,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.

I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go a bit lower. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower than $16,000.  At this point, cutting your losses and buying from John at $10,000 makes the most sense."
