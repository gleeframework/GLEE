Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Appealing to value:** I'm highlighting that the price is a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value he'll be getting.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not going in with an aggressive ""take it or leave it"" approach, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **John as a safety net:**  The knowledge that I can sell to John for $8,000 gives me a clear point at which I'll stop negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I don't want to break the bank. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not enough.**  While $9,000 is better than my minimum, it's still far from the $12,000 I initially aimed for.
* **Room for a counteroffer:** I believe I can push for a higher price with a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.** I have the option of going to John for $8,000 if the negotiation fails. 

**Next move:** I'll make a counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to find a middle ground closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go as low as $9,000. How about $10,500? That's a significant discount from my original offer and still a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the discount from my original offer and the great value Bob would still be getting.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum selling price of $8,000, so I'm not losing out on a lot of money if Bob rejects this offer.
* **Setting the stage for a potential deal:** I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but also leave room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. How about we meet at $9,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I don't want to overspend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is only $500 away from my minimum selling price of $8,000. This is a relatively small difference, especially considering the potential for further negotiations to get even closer to my desired price.
* **Risk of further negotiations:** Continuing to reject offers and counter with my own might lead to a stalemate, ultimately pushing Bob away and forcing me to sell to John for the lower price.
* **Time and effort:**  Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the time and effort spent on negotiations, allowing me to secure a sale relatively quickly.

While $9,500 is less than my initial target, the risk of getting a lower price from John or a prolonged negotiation with Bob makes accepting Bob's offer the most logical choice at this point."
