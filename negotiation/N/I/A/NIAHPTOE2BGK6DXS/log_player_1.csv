**Reasoning:**

Bob seems firm on his $10,500 offer and is even hinting at walking away.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's a real risk he'll walk and we'll be left with nothing. John offers a guaranteed $15,000 which is a significant profit over Bob's latest offer.  It makes more business sense to take the guaranteed profit at this point."
