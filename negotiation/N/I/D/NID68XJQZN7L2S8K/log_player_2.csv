"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $10,500 is closer to his budget than previous offers, he can still get the product for $10,000 from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice in hopes of getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still just at $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit more?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to get the best deal. I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer you the product for $10,750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,750 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice and not getting a deal within the remaining rounds outweighs the potential savings. It's better to secure the product at a guaranteed price from John."
