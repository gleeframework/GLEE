{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique nature and your specific needs, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob:
    * **Significant Value:** Bob gains the product for $550,000 less than its value to him ($1,000,000).
    * **Urgency:** The price is significantly lower than my guaranteed sale, encouraging him to act quickly. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price."
