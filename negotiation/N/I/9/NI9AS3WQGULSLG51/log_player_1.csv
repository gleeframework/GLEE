Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in your product, $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000, which is still a fair price considering my valuation and the value I believe I can bring to the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $800,000 is too low for me to consider. Let's split the difference.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1150000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm going to continue negotiating with him, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1025000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again and offer $950000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and is the highest I'm willing to go.  I believe this price is fair, and I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold, and we're running out of time. I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than John's offer. It's time to move on and secure a guaranteed sale."
