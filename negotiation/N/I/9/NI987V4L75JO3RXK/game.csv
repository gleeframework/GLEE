"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  Thanks for your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $140? This would still give you a great deal on a valuable product. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $80. If that's not acceptable, I'll unfortunately have to look elsewhere.",80.0,Bob,4,
