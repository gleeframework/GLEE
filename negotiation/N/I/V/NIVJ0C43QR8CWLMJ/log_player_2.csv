Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $16,000 is better than $18,000, it's still above his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice is getting closer to Bob's price, it's still more than he's willing to pay. John's offer is the best deal for Bob at this point."
