"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair and competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $700,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $700,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $650,000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",650000.0,Alice,5,
