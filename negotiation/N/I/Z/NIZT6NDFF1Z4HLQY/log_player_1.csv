Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I've carefully considered its worth and am proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal given its potential value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible while ensuring a sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,350,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially reaching a price around $1,250,000-$1,300,000.  
* **Avoiding a Rejection:** Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 might make Bob hesitant and increase the chance of him rejecting the offer outright. 
* **Backup Option:** The safety net of John's $1,000,000 offer means Alice can afford to aim higher with Bob."
