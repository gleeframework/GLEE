"I'm interested in your product, but I think $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  While $950000 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to drop the price to $975000. This is my final offer, as I'm happy to sell to John for $1200000 if we can't reach an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $975000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $925000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering buying from John if we can't reach an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,
