"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1100000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. I'm open to discussing a potential counteroffer, but I'm confident this is a great starting point.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1050000. This still provides a solid opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to propose a price of $980000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market price I've seen elsewhere.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $980000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1020000 as a final offer.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. If you're not interested, I'll need to move on to other options. ",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm not willing to go above $980000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $990000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",990000.0,Bob,6,
