Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product, but I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000. I hope this offer is closer to what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. We're moving in the right direction, but we're still significantly above John's offer. It's worth pushing a bit further to maximize profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,280,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1280000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to apply a bit more pressure. By stating this is my final offer, I signal that I'm getting closer to accepting John's offer. This might incentivize Bob to make a more substantial move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still working within a specific budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,270,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,270,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,270,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has made a reasonable jump, and we're now at a price that's significantly higher than John's offer. While there might be room for a bit more negotiation, the risk of pushing Bob away and losing the deal outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price. It's time to accept and secure a good profit."
