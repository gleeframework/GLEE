"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to me, I need to make a slightly higher offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's worth to you and my own valuation. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to secure a price that aligns better with my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.  I know you're motivated to sell, and this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to me, I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's worth to you and my own valuation.
