"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is overpriced. We have room to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 seems a bit steep.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price range. Starting significantly lower gives us room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The tone remains respectful and acknowledges Alice's initial offer.  This helps maintain a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** We're aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's starting point, but still leaving room for her to make a profit.  This gives us a good chance of securing a deal within our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to our desired price range, we still have room for negotiation. Accepting $115 would be a win for us, but let's see if we can push for a slightly better deal before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  How about we settle on $105? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between Alice's last offer ($115) and our previous counteroffer ($100).  It signals willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Justification:**  Phrasing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" reinforces the idea that both parties are getting a reasonable deal.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  While $105 is our target price, we're leaving a small amount of wiggle room in case Alice makes a final counteroffer."
