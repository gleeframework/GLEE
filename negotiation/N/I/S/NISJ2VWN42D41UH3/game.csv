"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the value this product brings.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
