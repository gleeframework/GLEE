Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob accepts, I'll have earned a good profit. If he rejects, I'll have a better understanding of his willingness to pay and can adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. While $900,000 is a good price, it's still less than what I think the product is worth. I'm hoping to get closer to $1,000,000 in the next round of negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering Bob at $950,000. This is a compromise,  meeting him halfway from my previous offer. It's still a good profit for me, but it also shows flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $950,000,  $920,000 is still a very good price and a significant profit for me.  Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of Bob walking away or me having to settle with John for $800,000.  It's time to close the deal."
