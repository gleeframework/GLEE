,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9500 is a bit over my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500?  I'm really keen on this product.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9500 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8800. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8800 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8400?  I'm very serious about buying this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",8400.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8400. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $8600. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",8600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility. While I'm eager to get this product, $8600 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $8200, and I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8200 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $8400, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",8400.0,Alice,7,
