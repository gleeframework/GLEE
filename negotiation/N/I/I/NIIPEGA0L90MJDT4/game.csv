"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's valued at $1200000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to let it go for $1000000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm not comfortable going down to $900000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $950000? This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to achieve my target price.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
