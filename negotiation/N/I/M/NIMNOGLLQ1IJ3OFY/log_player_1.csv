Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. She knows Bob values the product at $8,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at $12,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting Alice closer to her maximum potential profit. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By phrasing the offer as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" Alice might incentivize Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer before considering other options. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale at a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value while still leaving room for Alice to achieve her desired profit margin."
