{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a fair deal that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000):**  This gives you room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000):** This gives Bob an incentive to accept.
* **It's a round number:**  This makes the offer easy for Bob to understand and digest.

By offering a price close to your desired outcome, you increase the likelihood of a quick and successful negotiation. However, you're also prepared to negotiate if Bob isn't satisfied with the initial offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than what I'd like to get. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by countering his offer.  I'll proceed to the next round and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."

While Bob's offer is close to what I'm willing to accept, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm going to counter his offer and see if we can reach an agreement.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to save, but $1,325,000 is simply too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000 for the product, but I'm willing to throw in an additional $5,000 for the product's accessories. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiations have stalled, and Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum but not quite there. While the extra $5,000 for accessories is tempting, it's still not enough to justify the loss of potential profit. At this point, it's better to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000. It's not ideal, but it's the safest option in this situation."
