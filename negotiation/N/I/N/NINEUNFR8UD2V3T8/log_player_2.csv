# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our exclusive product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its value and importance, I am offering it to you for $11,000. This price reflects not only the product's worth but also the opportunity for you to secure such an asset at a competitive rate. Should you decide to accept this offer, please let me know, and we can proceed with the transaction promptly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the option open for potential negotiation with Alice or finding another seller with a lower price."
