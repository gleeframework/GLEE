"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,300,000.  This price still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value of this product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still below my minimum. I can offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
