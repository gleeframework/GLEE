"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation. This gives us space to find a price that works for both of us.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $1,050,000, I'm aiming for a final price somewhere between my initial offer and Alice's asking price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I can always go with John's offer of $1,200,000 if negotiations with Alice don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,300,000.  This price still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice is moving closer to my acceptable range, which is a good sign. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a $100,000 difference between her offer and John's price, giving us space to negotiate further. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'll aim to meet in the middle in the next round to try and secure a deal that's beneficial for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,175,000?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer shows Alice I'm serious about making a deal and willing to compromise.  Splitting the difference is often seen as a fair approach in negotiations.
* **Strategic Advantage:** This price point is still below my maximum budget and significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Time Constraint:**  While I haven't explicitly stated it, each round implies a sense of urgency. I want to secure a good deal quickly before Alice loses patience or another buyer emerges."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still below my minimum. I can offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is holding firm at $1,250,000, which is only $50,000 less than her previous offer. It seems unlikely she'll come down significantly further.
* **Better Alternative:** John's offer of $1,200,000 is now more appealing.  While I might be able to squeeze a few more thousand out of Alice, it's not worth the risk of her walking away or further delays.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time and effort. Accepting John's offer provides a sure deal at a reasonable price, allowing me to move on to other priorities."
