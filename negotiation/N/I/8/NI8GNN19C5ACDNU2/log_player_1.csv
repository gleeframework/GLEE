{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum threshold. It allows room for negotiation while still being profitable for you.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a budget of $120 for this product. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $150. I'm not willing to sell it for that price, but I'm also not ready to give up on the deal yet. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $135? I'm flexible, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, still above Bob's desired price but below my minimum threshold. It signals a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can still find a middle ground. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $130? I think this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $150, but it's close enough that it's worth accepting.  I'm willing to take the $130 to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether.  It's also a decent profit considering the product is worth $120 to Bob."
