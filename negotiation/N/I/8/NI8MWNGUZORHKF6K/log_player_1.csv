"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110.  If you're not willing to go lower than $125, I'll have to take my business elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $110 is a reasonable outcome. It's more than my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away and me having to settle for John's offer."
