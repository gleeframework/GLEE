"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is better than John's offer of $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, I'm only able to offer $1,050,000 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,250,000 is a better price than John's, it's still not the best deal Bob can hope for. He's willing to continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My next offer is $1,225,000, which is $25,000 above your last offer. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway once again.  I'm offering $1,150,000, a significant step closer to your last offer, but still within my budget. Let's close this deal and avoid further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to meet me halfway again. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next offer is $1,300,000, which is $150,000 above your last offer. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been steadily negotiating down, but Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is getting too close to his maximum budget.  He's only got 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely he'll be able to get the price lower without risking losing the deal completely.  Since John is offering the product for a price that's still within Bob's budget, it's better to buy from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
