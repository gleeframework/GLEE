"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000.

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000. Would that be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close as possible to your target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,
