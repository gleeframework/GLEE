It's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can get a better price.  You're willing to pay up to $8,000, so you have room to negotiate."

While $8,750 is closer to your limit, you're still aiming to save as much as possible.  You can try to counteroffer again to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
