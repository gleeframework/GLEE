"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic deal for both of us, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $1,400,000. Alice's minimum is $1,200,000, and you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. I'm offering you the product for $1,350,000. Let's find a middle ground and seal this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000. This is within your budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer of $1,400,000. Accepting her offer is the best move as it saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John. There is not much room for further negotiation, and you risk losing the product if you reject and she decides to walk away."
