Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is my absolute limit. I'm not willing to go higher. Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has made it clear that $100 is his absolute limit.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a better offer. Since we have a guaranteed offer of $120 from John, it makes more sense to cut our losses with Bob and sell to John."
