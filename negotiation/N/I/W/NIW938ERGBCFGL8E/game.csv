"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand $12,000 was a bit high, but $10,500 is unfortunately still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Let's meet in the middle at $11,000.  If that works for you, I'm ready to finalize the purchase.",11000.0,Bob,4,
