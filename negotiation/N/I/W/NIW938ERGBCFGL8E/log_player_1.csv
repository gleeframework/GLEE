Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Framing it positively:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts and potentially negotiating further.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still keeping the negotiation open and allowing for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to take the deal, I'm confident I can get a better price.  

I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I still have the option of selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand $12,000 was a bit high, but $10,500 is unfortunately still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price to $11,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintaining a price above his initial offer.
* **Reinforce value:** I subtly remind Bob of the product's value by mentioning it's a fair compromise.
* **Open to discussion:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage further negotiation and keep the conversation going. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Let's meet in the middle at $11,000.  If that works for you, I'm ready to finalize the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's also likely that further negotiation will take more time and might not result in a significantly better price.  

Therefore, I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $11,000. This ensures a sale and allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to no deal with Bob.  I'm confident that I can make up for the difference by selling to John at a later point."
