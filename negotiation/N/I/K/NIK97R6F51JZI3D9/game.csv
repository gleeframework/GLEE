"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $1,300,000. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm happy to offer you $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm confident this will be a beneficial deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
