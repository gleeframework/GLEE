Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is within your budget and represents a good deal for you.  It's lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and allows you to save money.  While you could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice could walk away from the deal entirely.  Accepting her offer secures the product at a favorable price."
