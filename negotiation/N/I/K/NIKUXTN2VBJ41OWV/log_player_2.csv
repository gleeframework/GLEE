"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $125. This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $125. This is more than Bob is willing to pay. Since Bob can buy the product from John for $100, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
