"I understand your perspective, Bob. However, the value of this product goes beyond the market average.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $13,000 is a good price for the product. I'm willing to pay $11,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the market value.",11000.0,Bob,4,
