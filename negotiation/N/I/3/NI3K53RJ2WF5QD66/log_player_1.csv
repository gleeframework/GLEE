"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $11,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $11,000 is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By stating I'm ""open to negotiation"", I avoid coming across as inflexible.
* **Positive language:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential for Bob, creating a positive atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's interested. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to reach an agreement.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $12,000 is tempting, there's a chance I can get closer to that amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a great price for a product of this quality, and it gives us both room to make a deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a margin above my minimum price. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Positive language:** I'm using phrases like ""great price"" and ""make a deal"" to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500.  Would that be workable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer, $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I'm still optimistic about reaching a mutually beneficial agreement, and there's a chance I can convince Bob to go higher. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $12,000 is tempting, but there's a chance I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. It's worth exploring those options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,000 for the product? It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By offering $10,000, I'm showing willingness to compromise and meeting Bob halfway. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm framing the price as fair to both of us, making it less likely Bob will feel pressured to negotiate further.
* **Reinforcing product value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth, justifying the price point."
