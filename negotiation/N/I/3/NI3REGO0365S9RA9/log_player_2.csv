Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $12,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a smooth transaction for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,250 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $13,000.  Buying from John at $12,000 ensures the best price and avoids further negotiation."
