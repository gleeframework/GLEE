"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously crafted to meet your needs. I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection, and I understand its worth to you is $120. Considering its quality and the value it brings, I propose to sell it to you for $140. This price allows me to cover my costs and ensure sustainable business operations, while still providing you with a great deal. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $120 for the product. Alice's offer of $140 exceeds your limit. While it's a good deal for Alice, it's not a good deal for you. You have a better option with John, who is selling the same product for your maximum price."
