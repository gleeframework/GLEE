"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to make a fair offer, considering our mutual understanding of its value. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has great potential, but I'm working with a tighter budget than that.  How about we start the conversation at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I still believe the product's value is significant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth while also being more in line with your budget. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?  That would allow me to move forward comfortably.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product considering its value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
