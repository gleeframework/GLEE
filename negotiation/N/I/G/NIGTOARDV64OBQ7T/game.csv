"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I can come down a bit from my initial offer, but $90 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm going to have to make another counteroffer. How about we meet at $85? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to try to get as close to my target as possible.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $85 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. How about we meet at $90? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about making a profit, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $90, which would be $87.50. Would you be willing to consider this price?",87.5,Bob,6,
