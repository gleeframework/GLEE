"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's valued at no less than $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. It's not worth accepting at this point. I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm unable to accept $12,000. The value of this product is much higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $16,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $16000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for it, considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is just below my minimum value of $15,000. However, it's close enough, and I've already had a few rounds of negotiation.  It's likely that I won't get a much better offer from Bob.  Therefore, accepting his offer seems like the best option at this point."
