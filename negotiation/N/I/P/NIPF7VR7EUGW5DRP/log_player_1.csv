Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to Bob, the message hints at its value, making the higher price seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By asking ""What do you think?"",  you invite Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, you might want to start with a slightly lower offer. However, starting high allows you to gauge his interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Market Demand:** While you have a guaranteed buyer, a quick sale to Bob might be more desirable than waiting for John."
