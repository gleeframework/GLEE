"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This offer reflects the value this product brings.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position on the product's value.  While I agree it's a quality item, $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle at $800,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your persistence in this negotiation.  I value your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, I need to be realistic about the product's worth.  I can't go lower than $900,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties.",900000.0,Alice,5,
