"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,000. How about $8,900? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750 again, but I think that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,6,
