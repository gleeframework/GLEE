Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** He has incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still increase the price if Bob is willing to pay more.

However, be prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects this initial offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can still potentially get a better price. You have room to negotiate further, and there's no guarantee that John will be waiting for you if you sell to him now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great deal for the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $110 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you do $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is only $2 away from your minimum acceptable price, and it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a small increase in price. It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale, especially since John is always a backup option if you need him."
