Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love it!"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to sell to him for $100, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price point.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $115? I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $100 is low, Alice. How about meeting halfway between your offer and my previous one? Would $107 be agreeable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $107 is a decent compromise, and I'm concerned that we may not reach a better agreement in the remaining rounds.  It's also more than I'd get from John."
