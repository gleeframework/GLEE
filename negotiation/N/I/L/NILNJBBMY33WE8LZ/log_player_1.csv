Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Strong Starting Point:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant profit above Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the ""opportunity"" and uses phrases like ""fair offer"" to encourage Bob to consider the deal favorably. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters, but don't go below your minimum acceptable price (which is likely close to $1,200,000 since you have John as a backup)."
