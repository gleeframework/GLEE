"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, hoping to get a quick deal. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I'm not willing to go below $100, as John is a guaranteed sale at that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, I can still potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above John's offer. I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to close the deal without having to go through too many more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $92 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  We're getting closer, but I believe I can still get a better price with another counteroffer.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm hopeful that Bob will come around."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter with $100. This is my floor price, as John is willing to buy the product for this amount. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John and be guaranteed to get my minimum desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With Bob's offer of $95, we're getting closer to my minimum, but I've already gone through a lot of rounds and we're running out of time. Given that I can sell to John for $100, I'm going to go ahead and close the deal with him."
