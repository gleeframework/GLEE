"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1350000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000, which is closer to what I need to get for this product.  It's a fair price considering its unique qualities. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
