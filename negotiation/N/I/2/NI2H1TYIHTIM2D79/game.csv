"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell it for $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92.50. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $92.50 is still a little out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $90.  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $92, which is my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,5,
