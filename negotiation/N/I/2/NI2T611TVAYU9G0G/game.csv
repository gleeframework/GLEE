"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
