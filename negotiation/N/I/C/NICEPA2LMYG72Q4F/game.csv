I appreciate your time and consideration. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.,900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe the product's value is worth every penny, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product is worth a lot, but I'm not willing to go up to $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $950000 is enough to reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1050000 for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to see a serious commitment from you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still not convinced about the price, but I'm not willing to go up to $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $980000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $990000 for the product. I'm making a serious offer, and I hope you'll take it seriously. Let's make a deal!",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer $960000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",960000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $980000, Bob. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. I'm willing to make one final offer, and if you're not interested, I'll be forced to explore other opportunities.",980000.0,Alice,9,
