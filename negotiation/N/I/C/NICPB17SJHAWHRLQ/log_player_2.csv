It's better to reject Alice's offer and counteroffer.  $15,000 is over your budget, and you can get the product for less from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, hoping to gauge her willingness to negotiate.  It's a bold move, but I'm confident I can get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is still asking for more than my budget. While $13,000 is closer, I'm going to reject and counteroffer again."

I'm increasing my offer to $9,000. This is closer to my budget, but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still going to reject it.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $10,500. This is closer to Alice's last offer, and just slightly over my maximum budget. I'm hoping she will be willing to compromise and meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut my losses. Alice is unwilling to come down to my budget, and I'm starting to get worried about the negotiation going on too long.  It's best to buy from John at this point, as it's guaranteed to be within my budget."
