"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is better than $150 from John, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $100. There's room for a deal that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** We're offering $120, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $140.
* **Fairness:** This price is still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $100, suggesting a potential win-win scenario.
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer opens the door for further negotiation, allowing us to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $130 is within my acceptable range of $150. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject my counteroffer and I'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Time:** Accepting Alice's offer saves time and effort compared to continued negotiation.

The $130 price provides a good balance between getting a lower price than John and avoiding the uncertainty of further negotiation."
