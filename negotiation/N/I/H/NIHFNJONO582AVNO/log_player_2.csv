"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $9,500 is less than your maximum price ($12,000), it's still a significant amount of money, and there's room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for better deal:** By rejecting, you can try to get a lower price from Alice, potentially saving a lot of money. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:** You can always buy from John if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($8,000). This shows you're serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate.
* **Room for compromise:**  This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to your target, potentially ending the negotiation quickly.
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  While you can always buy from John, this counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and potentially save money compared to his price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  Alice has increased her price from the previous round, making her offer even less favorable. This suggests she may be willing to negotiate further. 
* **Seeking a better compromise:** By rejecting again, you can try to reach a price closer to your target by continuing the negotiation.
* **John remains a safety net:**  You can always buy from John if the negotiations with Alice fail, but you're hoping to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  It shows you are serious about finding a deal.
* **Testing Alice's willingness:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but this counteroffer tests if she is truly willing to compromise to reach an agreement. 
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  It's still significantly cheaper than John's offer, making it more attractive than simply buying from him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is moving in the wrong direction:** Alice has increased her price again, making her offer less attractive. This suggests she may be unwilling to compromise. 
* **Risk of running out of time:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, the negotiation could become more difficult. However, the potential savings by continuing the negotiation outweigh the risk of running out of time.
* **John's offer is a fallback:** John's offer is still a viable option if the negotiations with Alice break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:**  This counteroffer is slightly higher than your previous offer, but it's still a considerable discount from Alice's latest price. It shows you're making a final attempt at compromise, acknowledging the possibility of buying from John.
* **Testing Alice's flexibility:** With fewer rounds left, this counteroffer tests if Alice is truly willing to negotiate down to a price that's acceptable to you. 
* **Avoiding John's offer:** This offer is still significantly cheaper than John's offer, making it a more attractive option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is unacceptable:** Alice has again increased her price, making her offer less attractive than John's. This indicates she may be unwilling to compromise.
* **Time is running out:** With only 3 rounds remaining, the chances of reaching an agreement with Alice are slim.  
* **John's offer provides certainty:**  While John's offer is not the ideal price, it guarantees a purchase within the budget and avoids the risk of the negotiation falling apart.  

At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice outweighs the potential for a better deal. Buying from John ensures a purchase within budget, providing a more predictable outcome."
