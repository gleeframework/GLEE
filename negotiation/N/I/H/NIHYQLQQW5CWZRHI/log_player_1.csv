Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $200.  I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to bargain down if needed. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's valuation is significantly lower than yours, so this initial high price helps gauge his level of interest. If he accepts, fantastic! If he counters, you know he's serious but you have work to do.
* **John as Backup:** You have the security of John's offer ($150).  This allows you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is interested:** While Bob's offer is below your minimum, the fact he made a counteroffer shows he's interested.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's a significant gap between Bob's offer ($100) and both your minimum ($150) and your initial asking price ($200). This provides space to negotiate further.
* **John as a safety net:** You can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest.  While I can't go that low, I could meet you halfway at $150.  It's a fantastic product and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 150}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate and aims for a price directly in between your initial offer and Bob's counter.
* **Firm but fair:** You're standing firm at your minimum acceptable price ($150) while still proposing a compromise. 
* **Positive language:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and aims for a positive tone to encourage Bob's agreement."
