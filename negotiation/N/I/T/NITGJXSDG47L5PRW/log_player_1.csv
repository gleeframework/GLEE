Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  You're still making a profit.
* **Lower than Bob's value:**  This gives Bob a chance to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I can likely do better than that.  I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit to $135. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer."
