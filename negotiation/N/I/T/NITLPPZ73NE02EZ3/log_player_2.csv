"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can definitely get a better price than $140! Let's start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We're starting with a low counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This leaves us plenty of room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $150 limit and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $125, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I love.  Let's counter again and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and say $112.50?"",
""product_price"": 112.50
}
```

We're proposing a price exactly between our last offer and her last counteroffer. This shows we're willing to negotiate but also holds firm on getting a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your creative suggestion, Bob, but I'm not quite comfortable with the split. I can do $130, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice went up instead of down, interesting!  It seems like she might be getting stubborn. We're still doing better than John's offer, so we'll push a little further but be ready to concede soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying my best to be reasonable here, but $130 is still a bit more than I hoped to spend. If you're really unable to do the split, could you meet me halfway at $118?"",
""product_price"": 118
}
```

We're nudging slightly closer to Alice's price to show willingness to compromise, but still holding firm below $120 and emphasizing our desire for a fair deal.  This also gives her a chance to ""win"" by potentially countering at $119 and feeling like she got a slight edge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you halfway. I can do $127, but that's as close as I can get. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly very attached to that $120 mark, and we've gotten her down to $127.  It's not worth risking missing out on the deal entirely for a few extra dollars, especially since we're still comfortably below John's offer.  Let's accept and call it a win!"
