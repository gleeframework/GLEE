"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $14,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. My revised offer is $16,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $16,000 is closer, I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're close to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my revised offer is $16,250 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",16250.0,Alice,5,
