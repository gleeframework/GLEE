Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but not so high that it would be immediately rejected by Bob. 

I'll analyze Bob's response to this offer to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I could sell to John for $100, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counter-offering at $120. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's lower offer, but still significantly higher than his price. I hope this will encourage him to move towards a more acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $90 isn't ideal, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $100 and closer to my initial goal.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and the risk of ending up with nothing if Bob continues to refuse my offers.  I can always try to make up for the lower price by selling more products in the future."
