"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $11,500. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $13,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $12,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",12500.0,Bob,4,
