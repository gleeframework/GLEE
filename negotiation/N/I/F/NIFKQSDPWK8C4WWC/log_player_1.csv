Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $150. It's a great deal for something so valuable. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's exact willingness to pay above $120 is unknown. Offering a price of $150 helps gauge how interested he is and how much he values the product.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $120 provides a safety net. This allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation."
