"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price. Since he values the product at $100, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his $100 value.  A counteroffer of $75 is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit since her value is $120. This is a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While $90 is still slightly above Bob's maximum, it's a good deal considering he can buy it from John for $100. It's likely that Alice won't go any lower, so accepting the offer is the most reasonable option in this round."
