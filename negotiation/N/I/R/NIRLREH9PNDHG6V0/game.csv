"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've suggested.

"I understand you're still looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $795000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any lower, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give up any more. I'm sticking to my original price of $800000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid we'll have to part ways. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,9,
