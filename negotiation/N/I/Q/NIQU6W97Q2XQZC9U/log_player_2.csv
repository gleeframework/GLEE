"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $170. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is too high. You're willing to pay a maximum of $120, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $120.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $145 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your maximum willingness to pay. Rejecting and sending a counteroffer gives you a chance to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $145 is still a little too high for me. I'm really interested in the product and would be willing to pay $130.  Would you consider that?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $145 was still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer the product for $138. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $138 is tempting, you are still within your budget and the negotiation is moving in the right direction. Rejecting and sending a counteroffer gives you a chance to potentially get closer to your desired price of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for offering $138. I'm getting closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $135?  It's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to meeting you halfway, Bob! I'm willing to come down to $140. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $140 is closer to your budget than previous offers, you've already reached round 7 out of 10.  It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate Alice down to your desired $120 in the remaining rounds.  Since John is offering the product for your target price, it's time to switch and ""BuyFromJhon""."
