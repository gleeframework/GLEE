Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding that you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at a price that represents the product's minimum value to you. This means you can leverage Bob's potential interest to negotiate a higher price.  

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have significant interest from other parties."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:** Directly addressing Bob adds a personal touch. 
* **Highlighting Value:** Phrases like ""unique value"" and ""significant interest"" subtly create a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **High but Reasonable Price:**  The $1,000,000  price is a significant markup from your minimum, but not outrageously high considering Bob also values it at $800,000. 
* **Time Pressure:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds urgency and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to negotiate but hold firm to a price that's significantly above your $800,000 minimum. 
* **John as Leverage (Subtly):** You can subtly hint at other interested buyers without revealing John's guaranteed offer.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving you the security of a guaranteed sale."
