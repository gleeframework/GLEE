{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,500,000, but I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This initial offer leaves room for negotiation and keeps the possibility of a deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still far below what I need to get for the product.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal of $1,500,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still far below what I need to get for the product. I'm not willing to compromise my bottom line at this point. I'll counter with a higher offer, but if he doesn't budge, I'm willing to sell to John for a much better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. $950,000 is simply not enough for me to consider.

Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet us halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd like to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to sacrifice my financial goals.  John is offering a much better price, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
