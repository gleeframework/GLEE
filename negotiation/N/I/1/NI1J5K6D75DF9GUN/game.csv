"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a fair deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. $950,000 is simply not enough for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers and come down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do at this point. Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to meet us halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done.",975000.0,Bob,6,
