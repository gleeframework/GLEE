"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  How about $11500? Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by showing appreciation for Alice's willingness to negotiate. He then makes a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than Alice's perceived value of the product. This shows Bob is serious about buying, but is also trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can likely still negotiate a better deal.  He's already shown willingness to compromise, but he also knows he has a backup option with John. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and might lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try meeting in the middle. How about $10,750?  I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's offer, but still a bit lower. This shows he's trying to find common ground and reach a compromise. The counteroffer is also a round number which might make it more appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $10900. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,900, which is only $400 above Bob's most recent counteroffer. This is a good deal for Bob considering he has the option to buy from John for $12,000. There's a high chance Alice won't come down much further, and Bob is running out of rounds. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
