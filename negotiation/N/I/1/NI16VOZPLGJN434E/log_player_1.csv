Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $11500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10500.  Let me know if you're open to that.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can meet in the middle."
