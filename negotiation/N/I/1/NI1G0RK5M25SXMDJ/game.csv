"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm prepared to come down to $850,000, which still reflects the product's true value. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $850,000 is still too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, and I'm thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,4,
