"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a good start, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the consideration. While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is a good compromise.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll end up paying the full $1,500,000 to John.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John."
