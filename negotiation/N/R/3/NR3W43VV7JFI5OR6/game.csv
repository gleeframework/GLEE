"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering the product but $13,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $8,500.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, however $8,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise given my budget. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
