Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more so than to others.  I've considered its worth extensively and believe a price of $925,000 reflects its true value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while staying above your own minimum of $800,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price still significantly above your alternative.
* **Justify the Price:**  By mentioning you've ""considered its worth extensively,"" you add a sense of value and reason to your offer. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  Negotiation is a dynamic process, and you might adjust your approach based on Bob's response."
