"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than $100, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $90 is a bit steep for me. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $92.50 is still higher than Bob's target price of $85. Bob can still try to negotiate further to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $87.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $87.50, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle again at $90, but I'll throw in a small discount for you - I'll sell it to you for $89.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $89.50, which is very close to Bob's target price of $85.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal, and it's likely that Alice will not budge further. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price, avoiding the risk of a longer negotiation that might result in a higher price or even a stalemate."
