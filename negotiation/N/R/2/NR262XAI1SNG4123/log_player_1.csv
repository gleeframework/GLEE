"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  I'm confident that I can do better than $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counteroffering with $100. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 less than John's offer.  It's better to secure the sale now than risk losing both deals by continuing to negotiate."
