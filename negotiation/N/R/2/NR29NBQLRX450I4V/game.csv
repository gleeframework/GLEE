"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a chance to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $975,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've both invested in this negotiation.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close to a deal, Alice, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I've been very flexible throughout this negotiation, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've both invested.  If you're serious about acquiring the product, this is our last chance to reach an agreement.  Otherwise, I'll be moving on to another buyer.",950000.0,Alice,7,
