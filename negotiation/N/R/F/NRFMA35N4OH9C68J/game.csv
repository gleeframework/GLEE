"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,250 is still a bit outside of my budget. Let's split the difference and go with $13,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
