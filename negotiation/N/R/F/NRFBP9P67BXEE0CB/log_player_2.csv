"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its exceptional value and unique features, it's worth noting that the product holds a significant significance to us at $1,200,000. However, considering your potential appreciation and the alignment of our interests, I am proposing to offer you this remarkable item at a special price of $950,000. This offer represents a substantial saving for you while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is lower than John's price of $1,200,000, you know the product is worth significantly less to Alice ($800,000). This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This might prompt Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her actual valuation, to avoid losing the sale."
