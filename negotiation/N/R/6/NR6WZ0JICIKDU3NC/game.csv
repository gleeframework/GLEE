"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I understand its value is higher, but this is my maximum budget. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000? That would give you a great deal, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to work this out, as I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
