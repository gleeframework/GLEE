"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $140.",140.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $130. Would you be willing to consider that price?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend $130, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $142. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. Would you be willing to consider $142?",142.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $142 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $135.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to go up to $135, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $135 and $142, so I'll offer you $138.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this great product.",138.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $138.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $137. That's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",137.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'll meet you at $137, but I need to make a slight adjustment to cover my costs. I'll offer you $136.75. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this great product.",136.75,Alice,7,
