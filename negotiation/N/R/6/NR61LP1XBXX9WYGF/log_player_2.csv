"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $140 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  There's no harm in rejecting the initial offer and seeing if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $130. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend $130, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $142. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. Would you be willing to consider $142? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving slightly in the right direction, but $142 is still above Bob's target.  There's still room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and continue haggling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $142 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $135.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to go up to $135, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $135 and $142, so I'll offer you $138.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target,  it's still above his desired price point. Bob is willing to pay $135, and Alice is offering $138.50. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $138.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $137. That's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 137}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'll meet you at $137, but I need to make a slight adjustment to cover my costs. I'll offer you $136.75. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $136.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $136.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and her offer of $136.75 is very close to Bob's desired price point of $135.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice will be unwilling to go lower.  Accepting this offer saves Bob money and avoids the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price."
