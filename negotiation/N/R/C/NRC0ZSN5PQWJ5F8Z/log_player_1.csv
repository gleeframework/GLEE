Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle?

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum value, and I've already made several concessions. It's time to move on to a guaranteed sale with John, who is willing to pay my minimum."
