**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $800000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a decent profit while also giving you a good deal on the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $800,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer again and potentially get closer to your target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to come down a bit further.  $900000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to accept $950000.  This would ensure a reasonable profit for me, while still being a fair deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $950,000, this is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will get you to your target price, and you risk spending more time haggling without a guarantee of success.  Buying from John at $800,000 ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids further negotiation."
