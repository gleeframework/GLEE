"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in buying it for $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. That gives you a good deal, and it's still fair for me.  What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $90, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. $90 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about $92.50? It's a small step for me, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be fair here, but $92.50 is still a bit too high. Let's split the difference and go with $91.  It's a good compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",91.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate you coming up on your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one, but I can't go lower than $91.50.  That's a small difference, and it allows us to close this deal without anyone having to compromise too much.  What do you think?",91.5,Alice,7,
