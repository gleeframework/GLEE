Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $7500 is too low for me.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $8500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $8,250 is close enough to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
