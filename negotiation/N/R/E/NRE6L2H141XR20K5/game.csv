"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you say?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a little too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is the absolute most I can pay. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $95 is your limit, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $105. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $105, but that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. If you aren't able to do that, I'll need to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already gone down to $105 and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $105, which would be $102.50. That's the best I can do. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,7,
