You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price before going with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $875,000? This price acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is still within my budget and closer to my desired price point. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might reject my counteroffer and I could end up buying from John at $800,000.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
