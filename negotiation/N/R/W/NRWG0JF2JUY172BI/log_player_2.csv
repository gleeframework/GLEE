Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is my best price for now.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower.  It's better to buy from John for $10,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
