"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counterpropose a price of $850,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise given the value you place on it.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000,  which reflects a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect your valuation of the product, I am unable to agree to $875,000. I propose we settle at $860,000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",860000.0,Bob,4,
