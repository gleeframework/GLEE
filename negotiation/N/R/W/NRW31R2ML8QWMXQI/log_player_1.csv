Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer allows for some room to negotiate while still leaving a considerable profit margin for myself. It's also a starting point that shows I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not willing to give it away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counterpropose a price of $850,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise given the value you place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price.  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000,  which reflects a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I respect your valuation of the product, I am unable to agree to $875,000. I propose we settle at $860,000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob is getting closer to my minimum, and  I'm willing to accept a slightly lower price to avoid any further negotiations.  The risk of continuing to negotiate and having Bob walk away is too high, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better price in the next round. $860,000 is a good deal for me and ensures a sale."
