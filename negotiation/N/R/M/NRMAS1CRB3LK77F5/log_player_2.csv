Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still not comfortable with $7,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
