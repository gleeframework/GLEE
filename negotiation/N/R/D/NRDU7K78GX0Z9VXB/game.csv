,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not convinced that it's a fair price for the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer to you is $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that the product's value will be evident to you if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1200000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise further. My counteroffer is $1050000, and I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to make a decision soon, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1200000. However, I'm willing to offer you a slight discount to try to close the deal. My counteroffer to you is $1180000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go below $1200000, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to considering John's offer, Bob, but I'm confident that the product's value will become clear to you if you're willing to meet me at a price that's closer to its true worth. My counteroffer to you is $1150000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1150000. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1080000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider John's offer. I hope we can come to an agreement soon.",1080000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1150000. However, I'm willing to give you a slight concession. My final counteroffer to you is $1120000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident that it's still a fair price for the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider John's offer.",1120000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Alice, but I've gone as low as I can. I'm not willing to pay $1120000 for the product. I think it's overpriced, and I'm going to have to consider John's offer. I appreciate the negotiation, but I think it's time to move on.",1000000.0,Bob,10,
