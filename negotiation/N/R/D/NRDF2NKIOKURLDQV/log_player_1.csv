I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but I believe it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. 

I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, it's at my minimum acceptable price. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's lowball offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. I'm going to accept John's offer of $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but it guarantees I don't lose out."
