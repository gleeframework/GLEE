"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119.  I believe you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

You can get the product for $120 from John, and Alice's offer is only $1 less than that. It's better to reject Alice's offer and go with John."
