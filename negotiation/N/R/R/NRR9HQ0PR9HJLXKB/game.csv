"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the special package, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, given your value and my budget. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. While the warranty and support are appealing, $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm confident that $8,750 is a fair price,  reflecting the product's value and my budget constraints. This offer is a good compromise, allowing both of us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
