"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a unique chance to acquire it before I explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,400,000**, which is higher than Alice's own valuation of $1,200,000. This suggests there might be room for negotiation. 
* **You have a better alternative:** You can buy the product from John for $1,500,000. 
* **By rejecting Alice's offer**, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John.  This gives you more control and leverage."
