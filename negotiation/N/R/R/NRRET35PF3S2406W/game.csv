,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To find common ground, I would like to suggest a price of $115 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair transaction while considering your budget constraints. Please let me know if this proposal suits you.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $110, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise as well. In order to reach an agreement that benefits both parties, I would like to propose a price of $107 for the product. This is a reasonable increase from my previous offer and a slight decrease from your latest proposal. I hope this suggestion is acceptable and we can move forward with the transaction.",107.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $107 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $102.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",102.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your position and I am willing to meet you halfway. Considering the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate, I would like to propose a final price of $104 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. Please let me know if this is agreeable and we can finalize the transaction.",104.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $104 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to finalize this deal for $101.  This is a small compromise for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.",101.0,Bob,8,
