Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a starting point for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get at least my minimum price of $800,000.  

I know that Bob values the product at $800,000, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation.  If he rejects my offer, I can always lower it slightly to try and find a price we both agree on. 

It's important to remember I have a backup offer from John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. This gives me some leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation,  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $800,000. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm confident I can get a better price, even if I have to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a price of $850,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between his offer and my initial offer.  

This price is still higher than Bob's valuation of $800,000, but it's closer to his offer, indicating my willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, this shows good faith and encourages him to accept.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to go below $800,000, so I'm pushing for a deal closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is closer to my minimum price of $800,000, it's still not enough.  I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer.  I'm determined to get closer to my desired price, and I believe that further negotiation can lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a price of $825,000. This is a further compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering my minimum of $800,000 and Bob's value of $800,000.  

This price is only $25,000 above Bob's last offer, showing my commitment to reaching a deal. It's also closer to my minimum, which strengthens my position.  I believe this counteroffer will encourage Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting frustrating. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm also starting to run out of time and energy for this negotiation.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $800,000 from John.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's the most logical decision given the situation."
