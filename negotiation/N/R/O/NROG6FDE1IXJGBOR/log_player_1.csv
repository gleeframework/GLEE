Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $9,500 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to offer $8,750.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and hopefully allow us to close this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750.
