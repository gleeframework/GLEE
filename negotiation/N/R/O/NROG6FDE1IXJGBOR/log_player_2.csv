"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $10,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down closer to Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $9,500 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to quickly get Alice closer to his desired price. He's offering a price that's still higher than his ideal but low enough to make it worth Alice's time to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $8,000.  While $9,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his maximum budget. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to offer $8,750.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and hopefully allow us to close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's offering a price that's closer to his budget but still higher than his ideal price of $8,000. This is a strong counteroffer that shows he's serious about buying the product while still trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice has come down significantly, Bob is now just $875 away from his ideal price. However, with only 5 rounds left, it's unlikely he'll be able to get Alice down to $8,000. It's more advantageous for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John at $8,000 rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
