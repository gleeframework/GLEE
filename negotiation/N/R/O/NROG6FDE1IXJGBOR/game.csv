"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $9,500 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to offer $8,750.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and hopefully allow us to close this transaction.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. Let me know what you think.",8875.0,Alice,5,
