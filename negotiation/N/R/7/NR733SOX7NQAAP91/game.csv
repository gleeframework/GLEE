"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,900,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $1,300,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, however,  $1,900,000 represents a significant discount on the true value of this product.  To move forward, I could consider $1,750,000. This reflects the product's worth and allows for a fair deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product and my own budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
