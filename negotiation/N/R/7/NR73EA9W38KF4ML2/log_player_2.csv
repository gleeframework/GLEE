Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above my ideal price, but we're getting closer.  Considering the limited number of rounds remaining and the risk of John's offer expiring, it's strategically advantageous to accept this offer and secure the product.  It's a reasonable compromise that allows me to acquire the product at a price that's within my budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's price."
