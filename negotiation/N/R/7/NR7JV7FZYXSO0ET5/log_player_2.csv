"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I've done some research and I think it's worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and my initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $850,000 is the minimum I can accept.

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $850,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** The price has come down from Alice's initial offer of $900,000.
* **Risk of Rejecting:** If Bob rejects this offer, Alice might not budge further, and Bob might have to buy from John at a higher price of $1,200,000. 

Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $350,000 compared to buying from John, making it a worthwhile deal despite not getting the absolute lowest price."
