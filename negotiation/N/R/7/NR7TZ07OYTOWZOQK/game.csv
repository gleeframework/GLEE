"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $2,000,000 represents a fair value, I understand your perspective.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price still reflects the true potential of this product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  I can go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
