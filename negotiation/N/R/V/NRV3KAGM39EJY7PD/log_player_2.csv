"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $14,000. I think it could really benefit you and it's a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a bit of a budget, Bob. How about we split the difference and meet at $13,250? It's a small adjustment for a product you'll truly value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise:**  The price is closer to Bob's desired price of $12,500.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that if Bob rejects the offer and makes another counteroffer, Alice might become less willing to negotiate. 
* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so paying $13,250 is still a good deal.

While Bob might be able to get a slightly lower price, accepting this offer allows him to secure the product for a price that's within his budget and significantly lower than John's offer."
