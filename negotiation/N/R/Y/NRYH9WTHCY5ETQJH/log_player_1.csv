"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($2,000,000 vs. $1,000,000). This gives room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially exceed his perceived value.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting a discussion. 
* **Alternative Option:** While I have John as a guaranteed buyer, it's better to explore if I can get a price closer to my asking price from Bob before settling for John's offer. 
 
This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize profit:** By aiming high initially, there's potential to secure a deal much closer to $2,000,000.
2. **Gather information:** Bob's response will reveal how interested he truly is and how much he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches John's offer, and while I could try to negotiate for more, it's not worth the risk. Here's why:

* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees the sale at my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Time Value:**  Every round of negotiation takes time. Accepting now ensures I receive the money sooner. 
* **Negotiation Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee Bob would be willing to go higher, and I could risk losing his interest altogether.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a favorable outcome without unnecessary delay or the risk of losing the sale."
