Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning a ""limited time"" or ""special price,"" you create a sense of urgency and give the impression that the price might not be this low again. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""value it provides"" subtly shifts the focus from pure price to the benefits Bob will receive.

If Bob rejects this initial offer, there's still room to negotiate down towards $150 before resorting to selling to John."
