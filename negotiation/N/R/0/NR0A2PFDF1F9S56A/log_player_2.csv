"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe will be of great value to you. Considering its worth to both of us, I propose a price of $140 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is within your budget, it's still above the product's worth to Alice.  You have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value. However, $140 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $130, which still represents a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. To continue our negotiation, I would like to propose a price of $135 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise that respects both the value of the product to you and the price point you're comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  $135 is within your $150 limit.
* **It's a fair compromise:**  Alice has moved closer to your initial counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Time is a factor:**  You're already three rounds in, and continuing to reject offers could lead to either a stalemate or Alice deciding to sell to someone else."
