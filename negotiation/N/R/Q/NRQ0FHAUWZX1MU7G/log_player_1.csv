Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my potential earnings.  This will give me room to negotiate downward if Bob counters, while still securing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still lower than my starting price, but it's close. I want to see if I can get him to go higher.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm reducing my price again, but still maintaining a significant profit margin. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept. If he doesn't, I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the better option."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still stuck at $1,200,000. We're getting close to the end of negotiations, and I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get him higher. If he doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a stalemate. Bob is unwilling to go higher than $1,200,000, and I'm not willing to drop any further.  It's time to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm happy with securing a good profit."
