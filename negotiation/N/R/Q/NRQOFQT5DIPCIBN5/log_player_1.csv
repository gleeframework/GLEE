Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me. To get things started, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I think this is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I see the value in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I believe the value of this product is closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  This reflects the significant potential it holds for you."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I need it to be a little lower to make sense for me. Would you consider $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offers, indicating a strong interest in the product. We still have room to negotiate above John's offer, so it makes sense to counter again and try to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to make this work for both of us. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it accurately reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:** By round 5, it's strategic to signal some firmness in the negotiation.  Bob is consistently moving upwards, so setting a ""final offer"" at this stage creates a sense of urgency while still leaving room for a significant profit above John's offer."
