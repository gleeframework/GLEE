"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds to make a deal and can always buy from John for $10,000 if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in buying but would need to see a price closer to $9,000.  Let's work together to find a fair price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $11,000 is still above your budget. It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and get closer to your target of $9,000. You have several rounds remaining, and there's a good chance you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $10,000, which is a fair price given the product's value.  Let's close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell at $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your price, but $10,500 is still above your budget. You have more rounds to negotiate, and you can still get the product from John for $10,000. It's worth pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're almost there.  I'm ready to pay $10,250 for the product. That's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell at $10,250. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is still above your budget of $10,000. While you could continue to negotiate, you've already reached a point where you're likely not going to get the product for your target price.  It's better to stop the negotiations and buy the product from John for $10,000 to ensure you get the product within your budget."
