"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in buying but would need to see a price closer to $9,000.  Let's work together to find a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $10,000, which is a fair price given the product's value.  Let's close this deal at this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
