"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for the product. Can we discuss a price in that range?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Alice,5,
