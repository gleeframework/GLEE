{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I believe it's worth a lot to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, potentially increasing his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than you think. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This product is truly valuable, and I believe it's worth that to you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $7,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially get a lower price. John is offering me a fair price, so I'm going to sell to him."
