Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $8,000. This means anything above that is a loss for him.
* **Value to Alice:** Alice values the product at $15,000, but has a backup buyer (John) at that price. 
* **Negotiation:**  Offering $12,000 allows for a decent profit ($3,000) while still being attractive to Bob (as it's a $4,000 gain for him). 

**Important Considerations:**

* This assumes no additional information about Bob's financial situation, bargaining skills, or urgency. 
* If Alice believes Bob is a very strong negotiator, she might offer a slightly lower price. 
* If time is a factor for Alice, she might be willing to accept a lower price to ensure a quick sale."
