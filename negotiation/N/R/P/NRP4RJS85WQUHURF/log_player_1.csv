{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a valuable asset that could be a great addition to your business.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate if he counter-offers, and also keeps the possibility of selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, $900,000 is a bit high for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle, say around $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation,  $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter-offer and see if we can find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $850,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a little steeper than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to offer $800,000, which I believe is a fair and competitive price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $1,000,000, accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations or selling to John at a lower profit."
