"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value for the product but still potentially attractive to Bob.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum value, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  I'll try to negotiate further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,500. This is a compromise, showing flexibility, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John. Bob has shown he's not willing to budge on his offer, and I've already lowered my price twice.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate, as I'm likely to lose more time and potentially even end up with a lower price than John's offer."
