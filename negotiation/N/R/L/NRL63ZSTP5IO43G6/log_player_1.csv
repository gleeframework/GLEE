Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He's getting a good deal in his eyes.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still making a profit, and you have room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob the opportunity to feel involved. 

Remember, if Bob rejects, you can always counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, selling to John for $12,000 guarantees a higher profit.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** By coming down from my initial offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Stay above my minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum of $12,000.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  There's still a gap between our offers, which allows for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation.  While $10,250 is still below my ideal price, it's only $750 away from my minimum.  Considering the potential for more rounds of negotiation and the chance that Bob might walk away, it's probably best to accept his offer and secure the sale.  This is a good compromise that allows me to earn a decent profit."
