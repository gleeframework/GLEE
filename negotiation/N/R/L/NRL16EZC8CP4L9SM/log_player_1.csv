Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in a negotiation. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth without being too pushy. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone remains conversational (""What do you think?"") suggesting I'm open to hearing Bob's perspective and potentially negotiating.

Even if Bob rejects the $10,000 offer, there's a chance he might counter-offer with a price higher than $8,000, which is still a win for me. If not, I have the safety net of selling to John at my minimum acceptable price."
