I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
 
While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that right away.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm offering $9,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my absolute minimum. I'm hoping this will be agreeable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is very close to my minimum.  I'm happy to accept this offer, as it's significantly better than selling to John for $8,000."
