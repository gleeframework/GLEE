Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you get significantly more than John's offer.
* **Balance Risk and Reward:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, but the potential reward of getting $140 is high enough to justify it."
