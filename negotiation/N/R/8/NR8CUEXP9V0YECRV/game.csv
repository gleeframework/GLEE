"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $19,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $19,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could go up to $12,000, but that's my absolute limit.",12000.0,Bob,4,
