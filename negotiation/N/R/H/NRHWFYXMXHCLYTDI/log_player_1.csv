{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe holds significant value. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.  This price reflects the potential of this product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our discussion. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $750,000 is too low for me, especially considering the potential value of the product. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. This shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is a fair compromise considering the potential value of the product. Let's aim for a quick resolution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum threshold. Accepting this offer ensures I don't risk getting a lower price from Bob or having to sell to John."
