"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, but $97.50 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference at $101.25. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $101.25 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $99. Can you consider that?",99.0,Bob,6,
