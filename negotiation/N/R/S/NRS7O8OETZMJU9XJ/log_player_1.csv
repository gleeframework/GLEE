{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $80 is too low, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you coming down, but I'm still stuck at $80.  Is there any way you can meet me there? I'm ready to buy if we can find a way to agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm open to negotiation, $80 is still far below my minimum price.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $105? It's a significant compromise from my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping to get this for $80.  It's my absolute maximum, and I'm ready to close the deal if we can find a way to make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  I've made several compromises with Bob, but he's unwilling to budge from his $80 offer.  It's not worth risking further rounds of negotiation when I can get a guaranteed $100 from John."
