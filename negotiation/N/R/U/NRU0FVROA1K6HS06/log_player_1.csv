Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice, but $18,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $16,000 offer.  It's better to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk getting even less from Bob in further rounds."
