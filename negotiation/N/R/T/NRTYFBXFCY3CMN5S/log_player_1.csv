Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  $12,000 is well above your minimum of $8,000, giving you a good profit margin.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Offering $12,000 leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a price you're both happy with. 
* **It demonstrates your understanding of Bob's value:** By mentioning the $15,000 value, you show that you're aware of his perspective, which can make him more likely to engage in negotiations.

Remember, the goal is to find a price that maximizes your profit while still getting Bob to accept. You can adjust the offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is still better than selling to John, it's a far cry from the $12,000 you initially offered.  This is a good opportunity to push for a higher price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer offers a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** You're not accepting his $9,000 offer, demonstrating you're not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** You're showing a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **It's still profitable for you:** $10,500 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000.

This strategy allows you to potentially secure a better deal without risking losing Bob completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can meet you at $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still trying to keep the cost as low as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While it's tempting to continue negotiating, $10,000 is a solid price for the product. You're making a significant profit compared to selling to John, and the negotiations seem to be getting more difficult.  Accepting Bob's offer will ensure a quick sale and a comfortable profit."
