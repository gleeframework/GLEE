Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, close to my ideal price but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making him consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* This offer is a good starting point. It's high enough to secure a good profit but still leaves room to potentially reach a higher price through negotiation.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer. 
* I'll be prepared to counter his offer with a slightly lower price, but I won't go below $1,200,000.
*  I will always have the option to stop negotiations and sell to John for $1,000,000 as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really want to get the best deal possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my ideal price and even below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better deal than $1,200,000. 
* **Not a Significant Loss:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a backup option, I'm not willing to accept a significant loss by selling to Bob at his current offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer, likely around $1,300,000, trying to meet Bob halfway while still securing a good price.
* I'll be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response to my counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to him.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  I'm ending with a question to keep the negotiation open and encourage Bob to respond.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* I'm confident I can still secure a profitable price, but I'm also showing flexibility to reach an agreement.
* This offer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
*  If Bob rejects this offer, I will consider lowering my offer slightly but won't go below $1,200,000. 
* I will always have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,250,000. This is the best I can do, but I really want to make a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a Deal:**  It's likely that I won't be able to get a significantly higher price from Bob. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I would ideally get closer to my target price, accepting this offer minimizes the risk of further negotiation and ensures a sale. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* While I could try to negotiate further, the chance of success is low.
* Selling to John for $1,000,000 would result in a lower profit.
* Accepting Bob's offer secures a reasonable profit while also ensuring a sale."
