"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below my minimum.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that works for both of us.  I'm also highlighting the value to Bob, hoping to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is a decent amount, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my value, but still offering some room for negotiation.  I have more rounds and can still sell to John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product will bring you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a little high for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000? That's a significant investment for me but I'm confident the value is there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is tempting, I'm still far from my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to keep trying to get a better offer from Bob, but I'm keeping a close eye on the clock and the option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 is still too far below my minimum. How about we meet at $800,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while ensuring you get a great deal on this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 800000}
