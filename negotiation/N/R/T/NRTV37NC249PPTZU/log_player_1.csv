Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $13,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $11,500 is unfortunately below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,250?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12250}

Round 4

# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12,250 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
