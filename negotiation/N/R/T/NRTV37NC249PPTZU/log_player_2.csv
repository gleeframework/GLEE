"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is starting too high.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $13,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $11,500 is unfortunately below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,250?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his maximum, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. There's no need to rush into accepting a price above his ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,250 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and what I'm willing to pay."", ""product_price"": 12000}
