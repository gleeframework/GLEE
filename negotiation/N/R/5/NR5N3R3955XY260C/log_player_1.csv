Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a chance to acquire something truly unique."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product's value is $1,200,000 to both you and Bob, starting with a higher price ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message highlights the product's ""exclusive"" nature and ""unique"" qualities to justify the higher price, appealing to Bob's potential emotional investment.
* **Safety Net:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 if Bob rejects the offer, so there's little risk in aiming high initially."
