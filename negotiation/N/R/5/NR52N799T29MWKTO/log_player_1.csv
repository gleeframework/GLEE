Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify paying that much. To start, I'd like to offer $800,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and the maximum I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a substantial undervaluation of the product's worth and potential impact on your business.  I'm willing to negotiate, but we're quite far apart.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it reflects the potential value we've discussed.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, and $1,100,000 is certainly a more reasonable starting point. However, to be candid, the product's value to you far exceeds even my previous offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This is a substantial investment on your part, but one that promises a significant return. What are your thoughts?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:

To demonstrate my commitment, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value we've discussed.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Round 8
Bob's offer:

To demonstrate my genuine interest and commitment, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and it's the absolute maximum I can offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise given the potential value we've discussed.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

While tempting to try for a slightly higher price from Bob, John's guaranteed $1,500,000 offer provides certainty and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in the final rounds."
