Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a good starting point because it's a bit above my minimum value ($8,000) and leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that I am serious about selling the product. 

I'm confident that Bob will find this price attractive as he values the product at $10,000. However, if he rejects my offer, I'm prepared to negotiate further. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, but it's still above my minimum value. However, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price by making a counteroffer.  

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit.  If his next offer doesn't meet my needs, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still protects my interests. It's also closer to my initial offer of $9,500, which hopefully will encourage Bob to come up a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is only slightly better than what John is offering. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I think it's time to accept. Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a better price, but it also risks losing both buyers and ending up with nothing.  

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that's above my minimum value and minimizes the risk of ending up with no deal."
