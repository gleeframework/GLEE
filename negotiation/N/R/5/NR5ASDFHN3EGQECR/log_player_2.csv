Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $10,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's intent to negotiate seriously. This also leaves room for potential compromises in the following rounds."
