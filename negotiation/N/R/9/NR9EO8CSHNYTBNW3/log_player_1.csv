Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* This offer allows for potential profit for Alice while also giving Bob a reason to consider the deal. 
* The message is friendly and encouraging to open the negotiation. 
* By keeping the door open to counteroffers, Alice avoids potentially losing a sale to John prematurely."
