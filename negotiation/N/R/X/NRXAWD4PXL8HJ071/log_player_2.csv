"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer.  Alice's starting price is quite high compared to our ideal budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $6,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to give ourselves room for negotiation. It's important to convey our interest while also standing firm on our budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice has met our ideal price! It's unlikely we'll get a better deal than this, so it's best to accept and avoid potentially losing the product."
