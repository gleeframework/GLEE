"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum desired value. This will give me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good return. I've also included a message to encourage Bob to consider the offer and potentially start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a middle ground. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired value, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer in the next round.  I have room to negotiate and could potentially get closer to my $1,000,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering $1,050,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be enticing enough for him to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $1,000,000 as a compromise. I believe this reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly the same as what I could get from John.  Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation rounds where I might not get a better price."
