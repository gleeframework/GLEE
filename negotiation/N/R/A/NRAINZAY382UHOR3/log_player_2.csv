"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. I think this is a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is better than buying from John for $15,000.  While you could potentially try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee she'd go lower and you risk losing the deal altogether."
