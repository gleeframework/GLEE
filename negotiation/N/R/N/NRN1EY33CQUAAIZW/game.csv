"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $8,000.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering it to you for $9,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,5,
