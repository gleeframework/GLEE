"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product, what do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $13,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what similar products are selling for on the market. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me though. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm prepared to pay $12,500 for it. This is my final offer.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $13,250. This is my final offer, but I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering the product's value.",13250.0,Alice,5,
