"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm hoping to get a better price. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not willing to go quite that high just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,175,000. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,175,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,200,000? This price would be fair for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate the willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1,225,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
