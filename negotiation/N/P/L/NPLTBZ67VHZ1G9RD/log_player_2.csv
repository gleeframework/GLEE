"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also leaves room for potential negotiation. I can likely secure a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm hoping to get a better price. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not willing to go quite that high just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,175,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still within my budget and can potentially negotiate further.  I believe there's still room to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,175,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,200,000? This price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate the willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1,225,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is within my budget and is getting closer to my desired price. Accepting this offer would save me a significant amount compared to buying from John.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to budge or that the negotiation will drag on too long.  It's a good deal, so I'll accept it."
