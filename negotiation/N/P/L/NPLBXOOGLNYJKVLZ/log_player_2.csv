{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your position, but $18,000 is closer to my asking price.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $14,000 is still outside your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle on $12,500?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that she's firm on her price.  It's better to take advantage of the guaranteed $10,000 price from John to ensure you get the product within your budget."
