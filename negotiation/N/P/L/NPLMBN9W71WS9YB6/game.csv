"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, so this is a fair price, but I'm open to negotiation.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,200.  This price still allows me a reasonable profit, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product to you.  What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,3,
