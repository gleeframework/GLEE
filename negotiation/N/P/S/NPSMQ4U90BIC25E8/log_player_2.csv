"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you on this amazing product! Would you like to make a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is less than your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for further negotiation or you can buy from John for $100."
