"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $75 for it. I believe this is a fair offer that allows both of us to benefit."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I recognize the product's value, $75 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to come down to $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further.
