"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product represents is considerably higher than your current offer reflects. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,525,000.",1525000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,525,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
