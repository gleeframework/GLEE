"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $100. I believe it's a great deal, let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It's worth negotiating for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often benefit from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is respectful and provides a reason for the counteroffer. 
* **Target Price in Mind:**  My goal is to pay significantly less than $80. By starting at $65, I aim for a price well below my maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $65. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, $85 is still more expensive than buying from John. There's room for further negotiation to reach a price that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. How about $75? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):**  While I want to be closer to $70, I recognize that Alice is unlikely to drop to that price immediately. $75 represents a compromise, moving significantly closer to her $85 while still keeping me below John's price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By suggesting this is a ""fair compromise,"" I'm hinting that I'm getting closer to my limit, subtly encouraging her to agree. 
* **Still Below John:**  Importantly, my offer is still $5 less than buying from John, preserving my negotiating position."
