Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential profit beyond my minimum threshold of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I'm happy to sell for $80, I'm not convinced this is the best deal I can get. I'll try to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 
I'm offering $90 as a compromise. It's still a bit above Bob's offer but shows I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $85 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure if I can get a higher offer from him or if I'll have time to negotiate further.  It's better to accept and make a small profit rather than risk getting nothing."
