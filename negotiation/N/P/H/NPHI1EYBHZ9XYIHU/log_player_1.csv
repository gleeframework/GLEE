Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? This would give us both a fair deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $6,800? I think that would be a fair compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, $7,200 is very fair. To be completely transparent, I did find someone else selling at a slightly lower price.  However, I prefer to work with you and find an agreement we're both happy with. Would you be willing to settle at $7,000 even? That would seal the deal for me.
