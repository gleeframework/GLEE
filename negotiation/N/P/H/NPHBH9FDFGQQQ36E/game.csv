"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm looking to sell it to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $12,000 for the product. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.",10500.0,Bob,6,
