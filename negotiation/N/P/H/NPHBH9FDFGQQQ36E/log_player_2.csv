"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm looking to sell it to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within your budget, will test her willingness to negotiate. This will likely lead to a back-and-forth process, giving you more opportunities to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $12,000 for the product. Let me know if this is more to your liking.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant increase from your previous offer, showing Alice that you are willing to negotiate. It's also closer to your maximum budget, leaving less room for further negotiation if needed.
