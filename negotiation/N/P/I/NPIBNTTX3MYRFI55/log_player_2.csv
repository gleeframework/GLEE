"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, but it's still a good starting point for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point, but I'm aiming to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000 for the product? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I have to consider my minimum requirements. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1100000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still within my budget and represents a significant discount from her initial offer.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and eventually forcing me to buy from John at a higher price is too high. Accepting the offer secures the product within my budget and saves time."
