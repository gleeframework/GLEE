Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth much more.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable value. This allows for negotiation and gives me a chance to potentially secure a higher price. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value.  However, I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  I will counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a good offer, it's still a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'd need $9,500 to make this work.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000. This is a fair price considering my budget and your need to sell the product. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000, but it's getting closer.  Considering that selling to John will net me $12,000, accepting Bob's offer would mean sacrificing $3,000.  However, it's important to remember that selling to Bob now might be more convenient, and the process of negotiating with John might take additional time and effort. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good decision. It's a compromise that allows me to secure a decent profit while also potentially saving time and resources compared to selling to John."
