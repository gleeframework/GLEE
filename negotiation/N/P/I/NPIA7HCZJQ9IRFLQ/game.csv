"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price, considering your value for the product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 isn't quite meeting my needs.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still firm on a price of $950,000. This price reflects the product's value and offers a good opportunity for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a good compromise, and it allows us both to make a reasonable deal.  Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
