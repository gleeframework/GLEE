"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $500000 at this time. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $500000 is far too low.  Considering the potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward. Let's find a solution that works for both sides.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1750000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750000,  which reflects a fair compromise given the value I see in your product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, but $750000 simply isn't enough. I'm willing to lower my price to $1600000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll seriously consider it.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down, $1600000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $750000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,6,
