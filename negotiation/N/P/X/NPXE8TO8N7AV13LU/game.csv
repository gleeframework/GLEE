I'm still a bit hesitant at $90. Can you go down to $87.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.,87.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $87.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $88.50. Let me know if that works for you.",88.5,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I still think $88.50 is a bit high. Can you go down to $88.00? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",88.0,Bob,6,
