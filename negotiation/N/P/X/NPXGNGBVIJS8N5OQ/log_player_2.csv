"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price, closer to Alice's perceived value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Be polite and show continued interest.** We don't want to offend Alice and risk losing a good deal.
* **Anchor the negotiation lower.**  Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer gives us room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a price well below $9,500.
* **Test Alice's flexibility.**  This counter-offer will help gauge how willing Alice is to move on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $7,000 is significantly below its value. Could you do $8,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice moved from her initial offer, $8,750 is still a significant markup from her own valuation.  There's room for further negotiation.  We'll continue to counter-offer in hopes of reaching a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that the product holds value, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,800?"",
""product_price"": 7800
}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Show willingness to compromise:** By suggesting a middle ground, we signal that we are serious about the purchase and willing to move closer to Alice's price.
* **Gradual increase:** Increasing our offer to $7,800 demonstrates movement from our previous offer while still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's starting point.
* **Maintain a buffer:**  We are staying well below John's $10,000 offer, leaving room for potential further negotiation if Alice rejects this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to go down to $8,200. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably, and her ""final offer"" statement suggests this is likely her best price.  While we might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, $8,200 is a good deal compared to John's $10,000 offer. It's time to accept and secure the product."
