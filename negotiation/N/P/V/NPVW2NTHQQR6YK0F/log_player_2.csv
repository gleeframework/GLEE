"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its value, I believe it's worth $85 for you. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $85 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation.  I'll aim lower and see how Alice responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That product looks great, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Would $60 work for you?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer ($60) allows room for negotiation. It signals that I'm interested but looking for a better deal. Alice might be willing to meet in the middle, getting me closer to my goal of spending less than $85."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your budget, I am willing to offer the product for $70. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to my desired price range, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer keeps the door open for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $65? That would work really well for me."",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  By suggesting $65, I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer ($60) and her counteroffer ($70). This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're considering my product, Bob. After some internal discussions, I've decided to offer the product for $70. This is the best I can do given the costs involved. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice seems firm on $70, and while it's not the $65 I hoped for, it's a reasonable price and significantly less than John's $100. Further haggling might risk losing the deal."
