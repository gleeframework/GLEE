"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be happy to pay $16,000 for it. What do you think?",16000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite willing to go that low. I can offer you a compromise at $18,500. It's a great price for a product like this, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $16,000.  If you're open to that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I may have to look elsewhere.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're firm on your previous offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you halfway at $17,250. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you!",17250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $17,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $16,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to come down to that, I'll have to explore other options.",16500.0,Bob,6,
