Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me. This creates room for negotiation, but also emphasizes its value. I'm hoping Bob will counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to him, I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll counter with a price closer to my valuation and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still reflects the product's value to me. I'm hoping Bob will see the potential for a fair deal and agree to this price."
