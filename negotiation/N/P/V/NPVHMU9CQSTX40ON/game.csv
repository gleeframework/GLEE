"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you see in this product, but  $12000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11500 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10500.  It's fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your guns, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make a slightly more aggressive counteroffer. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $10750.  This is a fair price that allows us to both walk away happy.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10900. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can meet at this price.",10900.0,Alice,7,
