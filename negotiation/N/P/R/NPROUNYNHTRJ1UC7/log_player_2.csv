"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $600,000 to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're serious about purchasing the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for your target price."
