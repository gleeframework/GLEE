"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, however, your asking price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for a price closer to $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $600,000 to you. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the value you place on the product, while also ensuring I get a fair price for it.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on your price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a substantial offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're serious about purchasing the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
