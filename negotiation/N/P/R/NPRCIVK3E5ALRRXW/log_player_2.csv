Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $850,000 undervalues the product significantly based on its potential and my own investment.  I could consider a price of $1,150,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a fair agreement.

Alice's offer is still too high. While she's coming down, I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my budget."
