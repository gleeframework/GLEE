"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $850,000 undervalues the product significantly based on its potential and my own investment.  I could consider a price of $1,150,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a fair agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still above what I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I place on the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
