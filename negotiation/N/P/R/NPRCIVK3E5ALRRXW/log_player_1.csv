Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still above what I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I place on the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear further negotiation is unlikely to yield a result significantly better than John's offer. Accepting $1,000,000 from John is the most profitable decision at this point."
