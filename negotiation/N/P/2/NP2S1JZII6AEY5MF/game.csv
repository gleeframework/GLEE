"Alice, thank you for the offer.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm placing on the product.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $700,000 to you. Considering your initial offer of $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
