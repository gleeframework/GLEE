"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I'm offering for sale. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I've included a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's at my minimum price and I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer Bob.  $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about $85? That's a fair compromise, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still below my initial asking price, it's a fair compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $80."
