"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to stay under $9,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay under $9,000, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can see the value in this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $12,000 and within Bob's budget of $12,000.  There's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price further, and it's possible she'll just stop negotiating entirely.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without taking the risk of further negotiation."
