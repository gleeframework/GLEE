Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell it for at least $12,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to accept and still gives you a significant profit above your minimum. 

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to strike a balance between:

* **Securing a Deal:** The price is attractive enough for Bob to likely accept.
* **Maximizing Your Gain:** It's significantly higher than your backup offer from John. 

While a higher price might be tempting, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer, forcing you to settle for the lower price from John."
