"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a price closer to my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $12,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to give you a discount from my original offer.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. To be honest, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do something closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $9,500? This is still a good price for the product, considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to give you a discount from my original offer.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to make a deal, but I need to be at $8,000 even.  That's the absolute best I can do. If you're agreeable, I'm ready to finalize everything right now.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to meet at $8,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $10,000? This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",10000.0,Alice,7,
