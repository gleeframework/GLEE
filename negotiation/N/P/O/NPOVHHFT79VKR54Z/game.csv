"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,225,000? This acknowledges the value you see while reflecting the true worth of this unique asset.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice's perspective, but I still feel that $1,000,000 is a fair price given my budget constraints. I would like to stick with this figure for now. Here's my counteroffer: $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I also have to consider the true value of what I'm offering.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,180,000, but that's my absolute best offer. I think it's important for you to know that I have other interested parties, but I believe this deal makes sense for both of us.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
