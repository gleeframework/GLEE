We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob's clearly interested. Time to apply a bit more pressure."

Bob is now moving in larger increments, and we're getting close to that sweet spot. While we might be able to squeeze a bit more, accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or us pushing him away entirely.  $1,100,000 is a strong profit."
