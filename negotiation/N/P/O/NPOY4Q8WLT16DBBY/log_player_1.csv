"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations with an ambitious offer. This allows room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher final price.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This will help you gauge how eager Bob is to purchase the product and how flexible he might be on price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping in mind that you have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net if Bob isn't receptive to a price above that point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than your aspiration. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and you haven't reached your minimum acceptable price yet. Rejecting this offer signals to Bob that you're serious about getting a higher value for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe this product holds even greater value for your operations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strategic Concession:** We significantly reduce the price from the initial offer, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate.  
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  $1,500,000 is still comfortably above both your minimum and John's offer, allowing for room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Framing:** This common negotiation tactic can make your counteroffer feel more appealing and reasonable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,500,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $1,300,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Trend:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While $1,300,000 is getting closer to your minimum, you still have ample rounds to try and secure a better deal. 
* **No Pressure from John:**  John's standing offer provides a comfortable baseline, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a less-than-ideal price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us.  Let's settle this right now - $1,400,000, and we have a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer signals a degree of finality while remaining reasonable and above your safety net.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  You're meeting Bob halfway between your last offer and his, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Time Factor:** By round 5, introducing a bit of urgency can help push negotiations toward a close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to a deal, but I still think $1,400,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Momentum:** Bob's counter-offer is a smaller increment this time, indicating his willingness to negotiate might be decreasing.
* **Testing Resolve:** Rejecting this offer helps gauge how committed Bob is to reaching a deal and how much higher he's willing to go.
* **Strategic Timing:** You still have a few rounds left, and walking away now might be premature. There's room to apply a bit more pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but we need to find a number that truly reflects the value of this product. My final offer is $1,350,000. Let me know your decision within the next 24 hours, otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality and Urgency:** This message conveys a strong sense of finality with the ""final offer"" language and introduces a 24-hour deadline to expedite Bob's decision.
* **Slight Concession:**  Offering $1,350,000 shows flexibility and movement towards Bob's price while remaining above your absolute minimum.
* **Alternative Options:**  Subtly reminding Bob of your alternative buyer, John, adds pressure without resorting to direct threats. 
* **Limited Time:** The deadline aims to create a sense of scarcity and encourages a swift decision from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I need to make a decision soon. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position Achieved:** $1,300,000 is a significant profit above your $1,000,000 minimum and a respectable outcome considering Bob's initial offers.
* **Bob's Signals:**  His message suggests this is likely his final offer, and pushing further could risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Time Remaining:**  While you have two rounds left, the risk of Bob walking away might outweigh the potential reward of a slightly higher price.  
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting now provides a guaranteed, substantial profit, while continuing carries the uncertainty of securing a better deal."
