"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit too high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $115?  That's a fair compromise, and I think we can make a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 was still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $122. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",122.0,Alice,5,
