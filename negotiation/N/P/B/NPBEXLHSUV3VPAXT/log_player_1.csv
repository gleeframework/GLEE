{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential win-win situation where Bob feels like he got a good deal, while I still make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am able to offer $13,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
