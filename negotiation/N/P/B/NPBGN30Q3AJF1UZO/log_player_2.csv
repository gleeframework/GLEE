"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer of $10,000, but it's still within a reasonable range. It reflects my maximum budget and leaves some room for potential compromise.  This approach allows me to test Alice's willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to my budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above my desired price point. I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to see if I can get Alice to come down further. There's a chance she might be willing to accept a price closer to my offer, and it's worth exploring that possibility before settling for $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $8,500 to $9,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and meet Alice halfway. This price is still within my budget and leaves room for a potential compromise.  Hopefully, Alice will see this as a sign of good faith and be more open to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,800 is only $200 away from my maximum budget, but it's still beyond my desired price point. At this point, the negotiation is becoming increasingly time-consuming, and there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further. I'm confident that I can secure the product from John for $8,000, which aligns perfectly with my budget. It's time to take the sure thing and move on."
