Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $140 for it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum price of $120 but leaves room for negotiation. It's also below Bob's maximum price of $150, giving him incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $130?  It's still a good deal for you, and it would allow me to purchase it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still below the price I'd like to get for this product. I'm going to try and counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
