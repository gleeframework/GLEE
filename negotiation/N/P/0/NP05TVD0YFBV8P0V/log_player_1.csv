"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation, while still leaving room for compromise. It's also a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable offer of $800,000, ensuring I still get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal value."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm running out of time, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  $925,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I think I can still get a better deal if I push a bit harder."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer, but it's also the price Bob offered in the previous round. I'm hoping that showing I'm willing to meet him in the middle will lead to a final agreement."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. Even though we're nearing my minimum price, I'm hoping I can convince Bob to come up just a little more. If this round fails, I'm going to have to seriously consider selling to John, since I'm quickly running out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 935000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $935,000. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it shows I'm still trying to get a better deal. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to finally agree. If not, I'm seriously considering selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time and the negotiation isn't progressing as I hoped.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price,  Bob is not showing any signs of budging significantly higher.  It's time to secure the deal and sell to John for $800,000.  This is a guaranteed sale that ensures I don't risk losing the opportunity entirely."
