"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to consider a price of $900,000 to start. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique at a significant discount. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $750,000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to my minimum price to make this work.  Would you consider $850,000? This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and allows me to move forward with this deal.  Let's find a way to make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $775,000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $775,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's try $825,000. This is a significant investment for you, but it also ensures you get something truly unique and valuable. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that the product is valuable, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer: $800,000 is the absolute maximum I can pay. I'm hoping you'll consider this price and we can finalize the deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
