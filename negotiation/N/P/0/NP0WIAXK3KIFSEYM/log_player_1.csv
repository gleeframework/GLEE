{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to consider a price of $900,000 to start. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique at a significant discount. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price that's still significantly below my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's worth to me emphasizes its potential value to Bob.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning John as a backup buyer creates a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Positive Tone:** Keeping the message positive and encouraging will help maintain a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm open to negotiation, $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price and even lower than what Bob values the product at. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I can still potentially get a higher price from Bob through further negotiation.  
* **Protecting my minimum:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, but I believe I can still do better with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $750,000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to my minimum price to make this work.  Would you consider $850,000? This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and allows me to move forward with this deal.  Let's find a way to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a middle ground between Bob's offer and my previous offer, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I again highlight the product's value to reiterate its worth.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone will keep Bob engaged in the negotiation.
* **Urgency (Implied):** The reminder that I could sell to John is implied by my tone and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $775,000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob has moved slightly closer, $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price, and I'm confident I can reach my minimum without losing out on the deal.
* **Opportunity to increase the offer:**  I can counter with a higher price and potentially secure a better outcome.
* **Protecting my interests:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower price if there's a chance to get closer to my minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $775,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's try $825,000.

I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** My counteroffer is a smaller increment than before, demonstrating my willingness to reach an agreement while still staying above my minimum.
* **Reaffirming value:** I reiterate the product's uniqueness and value to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a collaborative and optimistic tone helps keep the negotiation positive.
* **Addressing budget concerns:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints while emphasizing the long-term value of the product.

**Reasoning:**
