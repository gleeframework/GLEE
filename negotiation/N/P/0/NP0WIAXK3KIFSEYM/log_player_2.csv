# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to consider a price of $900,000 to start. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique at a significant discount. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $750,000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to my minimum price to make this work.  Would you consider $850,000? This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and allows me to move forward with this deal.  Let's find a way to make this happen.
