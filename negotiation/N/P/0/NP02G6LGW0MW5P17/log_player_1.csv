"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still allows you a good profit margin.  Let's work together and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but I am only able to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer, as it is still lower than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. While I don't want to lose Bob entirely, I need to ensure I get a good deal. I will counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  This still gives you a good profit margin, and it's closer to my minimum price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. I'm unable to go above $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal. I'm willing to take the risk of losing the deal with Bob and going another round. I will try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise that gives you a good profit margin, and it's closer to my minimum price."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've reviewed our previous discussions and am willing to increase my offer to $995,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $995,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000. I'm willing to take the risk of losing this deal with Bob and trying to get a better price in the next round.  However, if I don't get a better offer, I will likely move to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'm offering the product for $1,010,000.  This is a fair compromise that gives you a good profit margin and is just slightly above my minimum price.  I'm open to further discussion if needed, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this round."", ""product_price"": 1010000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've carefully considered your last offer. I'm willing to pay $985,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions and allows us to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, and Bob's offer still falling short of my minimum price, I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. While I would have liked to close a deal with Bob, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price."
