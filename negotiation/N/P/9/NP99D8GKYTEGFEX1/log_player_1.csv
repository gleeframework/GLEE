"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $7,500 is still a bit lower than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I believe this price reflects the value of the product and still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $8500 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider $7250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. While I'd love to get more, Bob seems unwilling to go much higher.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum, and I don't want to risk going through more rounds with Bob and potentially losing out on the deal altogether."
