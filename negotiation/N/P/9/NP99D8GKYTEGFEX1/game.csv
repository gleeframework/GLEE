"I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $7500 is still a bit lower than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? I believe this price reflects the value of the product and still leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $8500 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider $7250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
