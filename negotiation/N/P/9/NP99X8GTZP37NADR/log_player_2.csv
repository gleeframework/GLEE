(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,125,000, which is closer to your preferred price and within your budget. Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and it risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option, as you secure the product at a reasonable price without jeopardizing the negotiation."
