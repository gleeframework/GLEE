Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is quite high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for it. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the adjustment, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. I need to see this working within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Bob is still very far from a reasonable offer. We have time to negotiate further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, the gap between our valuations is still too large. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. Let me know if this works for you, otherwise we might need to explore other options.

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than John's guaranteed offer.  While there's a chance Bob might increase his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach close to $1,500,000 in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
