{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  It's in excellent condition and worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point: 

* **It's above your minimum:** You're ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Giving him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's not too low:** You're not giving away too much value right away. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product and I am willing to pay $13,500 for it. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below my desired profit margin, but it's still above my minimum.  Since I'm aiming to maximize my earnings, I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $14,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're finding common ground. I'd like to propose a price of $13,800 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value and condition. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is $13,800, which is only $200 less than my initial counteroffer of $14,000.  It's also above my minimum price of $12,000. Since I'm aiming for the best possible deal,  accepting this offer ensures a good profit. Further negotiation might lead to a slightly higher price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether."
