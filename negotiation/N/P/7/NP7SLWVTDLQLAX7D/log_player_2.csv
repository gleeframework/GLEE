"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is way above your budget. You should definitely try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Leave Room for Compromise:**  You don't want to start too close to your $10,000 maximum because it leaves little room for negotiation if Alice is firm. 
* **Express Interest:**  Even though the offer is low, it's important to convey that you are genuinely interested in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you the product for $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice moved considerably towards your price, which is a good sign. However, $12,500 is still above your $10,000 limit.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests she might be open to going even lower. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your target price. 
* **John is the Backup:**  Remember, you always have the option to buy from John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't pan out as you'd like."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Move but Within Budget:** This offer splits the difference between Alice's last offer ($12,500) and your previous counteroffer ($8,000). It's a significant jump from your side, but still keeps you under your $10,000 limit.
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:**  This counteroffer will show you how much Alice is truly willing to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option in Mind:** You're getting closer to John's price, so be prepared to walk away from the negotiation if Alice doesn't budge enough."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $11,000. It's a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not Quite:**  Alice is very close to your budget, but you're even closer to John's price. It's worth one more try to see if Alice will meet your limit.
* **Limited Rounds:** You have five rounds remaining. It's getting late in the negotiation to assume Alice will drop a significant amount. 
* **John's Price is Firm:** Remember, John's $10,000 offer isn't going anywhere.  You can always fall back on that if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $10,000 is the absolute most I can justify spending. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is your maximum budget, and it's important to communicate that firmly to Alice.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating you're ready to close the deal ""today,"" you add a bit of pressure without being overly aggressive. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  Be mentally prepared to buy from John if Alice rejects this offer. You've negotiated well, and you have a solid backup plan."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm trying to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a significant compromise.  This is a final offer from me, and I hope we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated that $12,000 is her final offer.  
* **Over Budget:** This price is still above your $10,000 limit.
* **John's Offer:**  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000.

Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay. It's time to exercise your backup plan and buy from John."
