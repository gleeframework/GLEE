"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $16,000 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It makes no sense to accept it.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is being upfront about his budget while showing interest in the product.  He's starting with his maximum price point, giving Alice room to counter if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $16,000 is already a very competitive price for what this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident you'll see its true value then. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth exploring if a further negotiation can get the price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you consider $9,500?  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price if we keep talking."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a willingness to compromise while staying within his budget range. Offering $9,500 allows for some room for negotiation and avoids the risk of losing the deal by going too low. This also shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product and wants to find a solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't go as low as $9,500. How about $11,000? That's a very fair offer considering the value this product will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to Bob's price range, $11,000 is still above Bob's comfort zone and maximum budget.  It's worth trying to push for a lower price.  Bob has several rounds left, and he should aim to get as close to his $8,000 goal as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to show flexibility while pushing for a lower price. Offering $10,000 is a significant compromise, but it keeps some room for further negotiation if needed.  It also shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a deal done and is willing to meet her halfway."
