"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $16,000 is already a very competitive price for what this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident you'll see its true value then."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you consider $9,500?  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price if we keep talking. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't go as low as $9,500. How about $11,000? That's a very fair offer considering the value this product will bring you."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he will reach a price close enough to your $12,000 baseline in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
