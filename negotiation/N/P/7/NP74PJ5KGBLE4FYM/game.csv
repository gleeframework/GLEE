"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price is still fair considering the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's try to make this work.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're holding firm at $750,000, but I'm still a little higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. $825,000 is closer to my target, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is my final offer.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
