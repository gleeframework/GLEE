"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds. I'll try to counter with a higher offer that's still appealing to Bob, while keeping my minimum price in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with a price of $9,000.  This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I believe it's a reasonable price that could be attractive to Bob, while still being above my minimum acceptable price.  I'll see how Bob responds to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm rejecting his offer and will try to counter with a price that's closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping to get closer to a deal in the next few rounds, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if this negotiation doesn't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm countering with $8,500. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good compromise and be willing to accept.  We're nearing the middle ground, and I think this is a fair price that could be appealing to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject it.  I'm hoping to get a slightly higher price, and I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, and I'll also keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,000. This is right at my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure if Bob will accept it.  I'm hoping that he's willing to meet me halfway at this point. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm running out of time and rounds."
