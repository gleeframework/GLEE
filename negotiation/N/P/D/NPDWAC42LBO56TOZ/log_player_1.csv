"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this valuable product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong anchor price significantly above our minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a high potential selling point.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition,"" subtly suggesting reasons for the high price without revealing our own valuation.
* **Openness:**  The tone remains friendly and collaborative, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $2,000,000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is already above his perceived value of $1,200,000. This indicates he's willing to stretch, giving us room to negotiate further. 
* **Below John's Offer:**  We have a standing offer from John for $1,500,000. Accepting $1,300,000 would be leaving money on the table.
* **Early Stage:**  It's still early in the negotiation. Rejecting now signals that we're aiming higher while giving us the opportunity to gauge his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value the product higher than your offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what you're getting."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a significant concession of $200,000 from our initial price to show flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Holding Firm:** However, we're still significantly above both Bob's offer and his perceived value. This keeps the door open for a deal closer to our target.
* **Value Emphasis:** We reiterate the product's value, aiming to subtly shift Bob's perception and justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $1,400,000. Let's split the difference and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob increased his offer by $100,000, showing he's serious but also revealing more of his negotiation range. 
* **Still Beating Bob's Value:**  At $1,400,000, we'd still be securing a price well above Bob's perceived $1,200,000 value.
* **John as Leverage:** We have the security of John's offer at $1,500,000. This allows us to push Bob a little further, aiming for a price closer to John's offer or a point where Bob's counteroffer becomes less appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  We are moving closer to a potential agreement by making a smaller concession of $200,000.  This signals we're willing to find a solution while still aiming for a strong price.
* **""Fair Deal"" Framing:**  By positioning this price as a ""fair deal,"" we aim to appeal to Bob's sense of reciprocity and suggest this is a win-win scenario. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is now only $100,000 below John's offer, increasing the pressure on Bob to either accept or potentially lose the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, let's make it happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John's Offer:** Bob's offer now matches what John is willing to pay. There is no further financial incentive to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob has signaled that this is his final offer, implying he may walk away if we reject it.  
* **Time Value:** While we have rounds remaining, closing the deal now avoids potential delays and the risk of Bob changing his mind."
