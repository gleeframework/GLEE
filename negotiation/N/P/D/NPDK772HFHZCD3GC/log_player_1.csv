Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."
