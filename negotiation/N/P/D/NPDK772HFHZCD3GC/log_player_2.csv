"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your asking price.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $13,500 is less than Bob's maximum price of $15,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** Bob already made a counteroffer and Alice lowered her price.  Pushing further could risk losing the deal. 
* **Opportunity cost:** Continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price.

Accepting the offer secures a good price for Bob without risking a longer negotiation process."
