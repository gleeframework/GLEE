"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as high as $7,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm afraid $8,500 is still outside my budget. My final offer is $7,800.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",7800.0,Bob,6,
