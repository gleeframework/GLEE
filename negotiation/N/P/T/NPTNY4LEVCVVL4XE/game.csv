"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, $9000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8750. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8750 is still slightly out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8625. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",8625.0,Bob,4,
