I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully maximize my profit. I've also added a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage with the offer."

Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
