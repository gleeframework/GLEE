"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing that we're both trying to find a price that works. How about we split the difference this time and go with $8,100? I think this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.",8100.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,900? I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay within my budget.",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,900 just isn't quite enough for me.  How about we settle on $8,000?  This is my absolute bottom line, and it would still be a great deal for you. ",8000.0,Alice,7,
