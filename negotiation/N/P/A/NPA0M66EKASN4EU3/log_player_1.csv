"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential value to him.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $140 is still within my acceptable range, leaving room for Bob to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I was hoping to keep the price closer to $120. Would you be willing to consider $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  While $130 is closer to my minimum of $150, I still believe I can do better.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Time Factor:**  I have plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
