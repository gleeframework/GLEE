Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit significantly above your minimum acceptable price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is likely to counter, and you have room to bargain.
* **It shows you're serious:**  A high initial offer demonstrates your confidence in the product's value. 

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he's hesitant, you might consider lowering your price a bit. But always be prepared to walk away and sell to John if you feel the negotiation isn't going in your favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is still a good profit, it's lower than the initial offer, and Bob has indicated he's not willing to go much higher. It's worth seeing if you can push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your position. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You've lowered your price, indicating a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintains a decent profit:** You're still earning significantly more than your minimum.
* **Sets a clear boundary:** You've stated this is your final offer, putting pressure on Bob to decide.

This strategy aims to push Bob towards a deal, but you're still prepared to walk away if necessary. Keep in mind that John is always a viable option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **The price is fair:** You're still getting a profit significantly higher than your minimum, and you've already made some concessions.
* **Bob's negotiation tactics suggest he's unlikely to go higher.** He's offered ""halfway"" and stated he hopes for an agreement, indicating he may not be willing to budge further.
* **There's a risk in continuing:** If you reject Bob's offer, you risk him walking away, leaving you with only John's lower offer.

While you might hope for a slightly higher price, securing a deal with Bob at $1,250,000 is a good outcome given the circumstances."
