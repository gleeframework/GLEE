"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $10,000 to me and I know you value it at $8,000.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. If I accept her offer, I'll end up paying $9,500, which is more than the $8,000 I'm willing to pay. I'll wait and see if John's offer is better.
