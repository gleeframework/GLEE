"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. I'll accept $950,000 for the product.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $875,000 is closer, I'm still not at a point where I can accept.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll accept $912,500 for the product. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",912500.0,Alice,5,
