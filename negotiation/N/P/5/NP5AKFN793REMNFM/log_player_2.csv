"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is lower than her product's value to her ($150), you know you can get a better deal from John at $120. By rejecting this offer, you can maximize your savings."
