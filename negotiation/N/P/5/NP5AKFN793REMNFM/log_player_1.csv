Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** We start with a price closer to your minimum ($150) than Bob's valuation ($120). This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Limited-time offer:**  Creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to decide quicker.
* **Value proposition:**  Instead of focusing solely on price, highlighting the ""value"" aims to shift Bob's focus from the cost to potential benefits, making the offer more appealing. 

**Outcome possibilities:**

* **Bob accepts:** Great! You get more than your minimum and a quicker sale.
* **Bob negotiates:** You have room to lower the price slightly while staying above your $150 minimum.
* **Bob rejects:** You move on to John, securing your minimum acceptable price."
