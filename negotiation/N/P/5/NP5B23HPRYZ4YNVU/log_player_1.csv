"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insight, and it could be a game-changer for you. I'm initially offering it at $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, we anchor the negotiation high. This leaves room for potential concessions while maximizing potential profit.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer serves as a gauge of Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** We have the safety net of John's offer ($1,000,000), so we can afford to be slightly bolder in our opening."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is substantial, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  There's a decent chance we can negotiate a higher price. We're aiming to capture as much of the $500,000 difference between his valuation and our minimum as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budgetary considerations. However, the value of this product is truly unique and I believe my initial offer reflects its potential. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** By suggesting $1,300,000, we're splitting the difference between Bob's offer and our previous price. This signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price above our minimum.
* **Maintain Value Emphasis:**  We're reiterating the product's unique value, reminding Bob why exceeding his initial budget might be worthwhile. 
* **Continued Negotiation:**  We're showing commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement by making a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the gesture, I still feel that the product should be within my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,250,000. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  $1,250,000 is a strong offer. It's significantly above our minimum ($1,000,000) and represents a 25% profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating serious interest. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or reaching an impasse.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation could push Bob away or create unnecessary complexity.  Accepting a good offer now ensures a timely and profitable deal."
