Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This would still be a good deal for you, as you value it at $10,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.
