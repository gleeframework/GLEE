"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? Let's make this deal happen!",110.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $108? That's the best I can do.,108.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet halfway at $110. That would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
