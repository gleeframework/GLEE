"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I understand its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My initial price is $1,300,000. I'm open to discussion, but I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair starting point given the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you understanding the product's value to me. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your offer, it falls short of the product's true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,225,000. This price is fair and allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
