"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you understanding the product's value to me. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
