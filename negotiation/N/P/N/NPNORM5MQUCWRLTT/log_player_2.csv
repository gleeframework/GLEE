"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I understand its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My initial price is $1,300,000. I'm open to discussion, but I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair starting point given the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

It's not a good idea to accept Alice's offer right away.  You want to try to negotiate a lower price.  Going to John is also a bad idea, as his price is the same as the maximum you are willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you understanding the product's value to me. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your offer, it falls short of the product's true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,225,000. This price is fair and allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

Alice's offer is close to your maximum price, and you can still make a good profit.  Buying from John would cost you more."
