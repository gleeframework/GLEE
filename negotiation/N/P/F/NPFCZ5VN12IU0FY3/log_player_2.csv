"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Knowing it's worth a significant amount to you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a win-win situation, allowing you to gain considerable value while still providing me a fair return. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I will reject Alice's offer because I can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is more than Alice's offer. I want to save as much money as I can.
