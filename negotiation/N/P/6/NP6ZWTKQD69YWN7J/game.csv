"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to me.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a great product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16,000. It's still a great deal, considering its value to me, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $16,000 is still a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $14,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value it holds for me. I think it's still a great deal, and I hope you'll consider it.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle - I'm offering $13,250. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can both agree on it.",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $13,250. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,750. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",13750.0,Alice,7,
