You should reject Alice's offer.  You can do better than $1,000,000.  You have room to negotiate a lower price with Alice, or you can always buy from John for $800,000."

I'm offering Alice $850,000. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it's significantly lower than her initial offer but still within a reasonable range for both of us.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but it's still higher than you're willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and you should try to lower the price further."

I'm offering Alice $900,000. This is a compromise, closer to her last offer but still within your budget. You're showing flexibility while also demonstrating you're serious about getting a fair price."
