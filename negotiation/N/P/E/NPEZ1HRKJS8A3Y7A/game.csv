"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is my maximum price point. Let me know your thoughts.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $9000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is fair considering my budget and the value you've described. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $13000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.
