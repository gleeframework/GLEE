"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** Emphasizing my willingness to negotiate shows flexibility and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Reason for the Price:**  While I haven't given Bob details on the product yet, suggesting it's ""fantastic"" primes him to potentially see value in it. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get a good price, but also want to keep Bob engaged.  I'm starting high, but leaving room for negotiation to see what Bob's true value perception is. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While $100 is acceptable, I'm not desperate to sell at this point. I have the option to sell to John, and there are still 8 rounds to potentially get a better price from Bob.
* **Negotiation is key:** By rejecting, I can explore if Bob is willing to budge from his offer.  

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counter with a price slightly above $100.  This shows flexibility while trying to maximize my profit. I'll also consider how much time is left in the negotiation and the possibility of selling to John if I don't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  That's still a fair deal, considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but Significant Increase:**  I'm increasing the price by $20, which is a noticeable jump from Bob's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to potentially sway him towards accepting.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm keeping the communication open to see if Bob will meet me halfway.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to gradually raise the price while staying within a reasonable range for Bob. I'm willing to accept a slightly lower price than my initial asking price, but I want to see if Bob will compromise. I'll continue to assess his counteroffers and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm not willing to sell for that.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:**  John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not desperate to close with Bob at this point.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are still 6 rounds left, giving me time to explore if Bob is willing to go higher.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price than my previous offer, but still lower than John's offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise further. I'll also continue to assess how many rounds are left and how much potential there is to get a better price from Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is just too low for me. I'm prepared to drop the price to $110. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's a little lower than my previous offer but still higher than Bob's. This shows I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value again, hoping to persuade him to consider a higher price.
* **Direct and Clear:**  My message is concise and to the point, leaving no room for ambiguity.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground with Bob.  I've lowered my price, but I'm still trying to get as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible. I'll continue to monitor Bob's responses and adapt my strategy based on his willingness to negotiate. If he remains stubborn, I'll consider selling to John as the rounds are getting fewer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the price I'm comfortable with. How about $95? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic. If I accept, I'm essentially losing money compared to selling to John.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** There's still a chance Bob might be willing to go higher.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still above Bob's offer. My goal is to see if Bob will budge closer to $100 in the remaining rounds. If he doesn't, selling to John becomes increasingly attractive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product, and it leaves us both with something to gain. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closer to Minimum:**  I'm offering a price that's only $5 away from my minimum acceptable price, showing I'm getting closer to accepting.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  I'm highlighting that I'm already offering a compromise, putting pressure on Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Focus on Mutual Gain:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds left, I'm taking a more aggressive approach. I'm pushing Bob closer to my minimum price, hoping to secure a deal before I have to resort to selling to John. I'll continue to assess Bob's willingness to negotiate and adapt my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $105. I was thinking more along the lines of $98. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to the wire with only two rounds left.
* **Close to Minimum, But Not There:** $98 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Risk of Losing Value:**  There's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer further, and I might end up selling for less than John's offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While it's not the ideal price, it guarantees me a profit and eliminates the risk of getting a worse deal from Bob.  The time pressure and the likelihood of a lower price if I continue negotiating with Bob make selling to John the safest and most pragmatic option."
