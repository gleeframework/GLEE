"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  That's still a fair deal, considering the value of this product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is just too low for me. I'm prepared to drop the price to $110. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of this product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to the price I'm comfortable with. How about $95? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product, and it leaves us both with something to gain. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $105. I was thinking more along the lines of $98. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",98.0,Bob,8,
