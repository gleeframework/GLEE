"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This way, we both feel like we're getting a fair deal.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,875? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits us both.",9875.0,Bob,4,
