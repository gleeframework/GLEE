"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is less than Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still above Alice's valuation.  This allows room for further negotiation while keeping the deal within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This way, we both feel like we're getting a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $10,250 is a better offer than Alice's previous one, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There's still room to negotiate and find a deal that works better for Bob.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring potential compromises."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,875? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 9875}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground that's closer to his initial counteroffer while still acknowledging Alice's need for a higher price.  This offer is a slight increase from Bob's previous counteroffer, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming to save money."
