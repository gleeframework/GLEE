Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your willingness to pay $85 for the product. To ensure we're both satisfied, I propose a price of $90 for this transaction. This allows us to respect each other's valuation while ensuring I receive a fair return for the product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $90 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $85. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to pay $87.50 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway. It's a small increment from my previous offer, showing that I'm serious about getting a deal but still keeping the price within my budget.  This should encourage Alice to seriously consider accepting the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I've considered your latest offer and am willing to meet somewhere in the middle. I propose a price of $88.50 for the product. This acknowledges your valuation while also ensuring a fair return for me. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $88.5 is within my budget and very close to my ideal price point of $85.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to compromise.  Given that I have a limited number of rounds, accepting her offer is the best way to secure the product at a price that's still a good deal for me."
