Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that still provides Bob with a perceived ""deal,"" as it's significantly less than the product's value to him ($8,000). 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob immediately eliminates any potential delays or complications associated with waiting for John's purchase."
