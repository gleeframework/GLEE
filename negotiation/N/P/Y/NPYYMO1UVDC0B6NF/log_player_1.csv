I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This gives him some room to negotiate while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $85. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between his offer of $75 and my minimum acceptable price of $80."
