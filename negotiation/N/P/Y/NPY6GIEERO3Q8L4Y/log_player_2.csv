"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $9,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $7,500 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal happen.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down to $8,000 or a price closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $8,200.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 8200}
