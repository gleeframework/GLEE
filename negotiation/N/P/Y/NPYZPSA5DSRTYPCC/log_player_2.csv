Since you're looking for a product worth no more than $10,000 to you, and Alice's offer is $15,000, it's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice is still holding out for a price above your maximum budget. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $10,000.  You've already made a few counteroffers and you're unlikely to get Alice any lower."
