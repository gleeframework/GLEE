"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a favorable outcome.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value and potential"" subtly reinforces why the product is worth a significant sum.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone remains collaborative (""What are your thoughts?"") to encourage Bob's engagement and gauge his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is above our minimum, it's still a significant distance from our initial ask.  We have room to negotiate and can likely secure a better price. Selling to John right now would mean losing out on a potential profit.  It's worth seeing if we can meet somewhere in the middle with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $1,250,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  Would you be willing to meet halfway at $1,325,000?"",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Budget:** Recognizing Bob's budget shows understanding and builds rapport.
* **Highlight Value:** Re-emphasizing the product's ""true potential"" subtly pushes back on the undervaluation. 
* **Compromise:** By suggesting the exact midpoint, we demonstrate flexibility and a desire to reach a mutually agreeable price. This strategy might encourage Bob to make a similar move towards our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has signaled that his absolute limit is $1,200,000. Continuing to negotiate would likely be unproductive. We have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount. It's time to secure the sale and avoid the risk of Bob walking away, leaving us with a less favorable outcome."
