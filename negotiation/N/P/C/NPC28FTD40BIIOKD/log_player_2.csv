"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a one-time deal for you. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm excited to consider Alice's offer. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to her, I'm not sure if she's willing to go any lower. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still a significant amount above my budget of $800,000.

I'll reject Alice's offer and consider buying the product from John for $800,000, which fits within my budget.
