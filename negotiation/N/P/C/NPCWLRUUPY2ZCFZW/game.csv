"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm firm on $9,000. This price still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to think this isn't going to work out. I'm really close to selling to John for $10,000.  To make this happen, I need to know if you're serious about buying. I'm willing to go down to $8,800, but that's my absolute final offer. Let me know if you're in.",8800.0,Alice,7,
