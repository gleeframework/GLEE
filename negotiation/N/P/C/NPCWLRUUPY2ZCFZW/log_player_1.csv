Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm firm on $9,000.

Round 5

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While $8,600 is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I've been negotiating for a while now, and I'm tired of going back and forth. I'm going to sell to John for $10,000 and save myself the hassle."
