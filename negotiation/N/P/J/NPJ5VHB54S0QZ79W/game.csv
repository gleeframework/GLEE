"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $700000 for this product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $700000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns and still reflects the product's true value.",800000.0,Alice,3,
