"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay $12,000.  By rejecting, he can try to negotiate a better price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you have other options, $8,500 is far below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair compromise.  It's a great price for a product of this quality.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still get the product from John for $8,000, which is a better price than Alice's offer of $10,000.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice, potentially offering a slightly higher price, but not exceeding $8,000."

This is a fair price, considering I can get the same product elsewhere for $8,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
