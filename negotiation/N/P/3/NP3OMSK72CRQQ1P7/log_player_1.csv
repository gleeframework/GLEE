Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above Bob's perceived value:** $12,000 is higher than Bob's $8,000 valuation, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **Is significantly below your minimum:**  $12,000 is still $3,000 below your minimum of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation and potentially a good profit for you. 
* **Is open-ended:**  The message invites Bob to discuss the offer and potentially counter, keeping the negotiation open. 

This strategy aims to quickly find out if Bob is genuinely interested in the product at a price close to your minimum. If he rejects, you can use John as leverage to push Bob closer to your target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, I'm not comfortable with $12,000.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  This is my best offer, as I can purchase the product elsewhere for that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum value of $15,000.  While it's tempting to take the $8,500, it's better to try to negotiate further. Here's why:

* **John as leverage:**  You have a guaranteed buyer in John for $15,000.  Knowing this gives you a strong position to negotiate with Bob.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still room for Bob to come up in price.  By rejecting his offer, you're demonstrating that you're not desperate and willing to wait for a better deal.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can send a counteroffer that is closer to your target price, hopefully prompting Bob to meet you somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you have other options, $8,500 is far below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair compromise.  It's a great price for a product of this quality.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show flexibility:** While you're not accepting Bob's low offer, you're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by reducing your price.
* **Maintain a strong position:**  $10,000 is still closer to your minimum price than Bob's offer.  It shows that you're not willing to settle for a low price, keeping the pressure on Bob.
* **Set a clear expectation:** By offering a specific price, you're avoiding a drawn-out negotiation process. 
* **Highlight the value:**  The message reminds Bob of the product's quality and potential value, encouraging him to reconsider his offer. 

This strategy is aimed at finding a middle ground while ensuring you still achieve a decent profit from the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering I can get the same product elsewhere for $8,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to your minimum of $15,000, it's still not a profitable deal for you.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John for $15,000, and it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob.

Here's why:

* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures you get your minimum desired price, guaranteeing a significant profit.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take time, potentially delaying the sale and ultimately resulting in a lower profit.
* **Limited upside:**  While Bob might increase his offer, the potential gain is limited, and the risk of further negotiation is not worth it.

Selling to John is the most secure and profitable decision, ensuring you get the best possible outcome."
