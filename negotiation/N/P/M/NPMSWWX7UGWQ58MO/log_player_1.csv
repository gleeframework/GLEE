Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $150, there's a chance to get a slightly higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it for $145 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value ($120) but leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it at my minimum acceptable price."
