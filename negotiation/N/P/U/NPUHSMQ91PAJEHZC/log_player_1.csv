{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. I'm asking for $1,199,999. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1199999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to aim for the highest possible price Bob might accept.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Starting just below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency for Bob and positions the offer as a potential bargain. 
* **Alternative Option:** Highlighting other interested parties subtly reminds Bob he might miss out if he hesitates.

This offer aims to secure the highest possible profit while still being enticing enough for Bob to accept."
