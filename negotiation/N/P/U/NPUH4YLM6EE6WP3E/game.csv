"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and what I've researched about the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective on the market value, but I have to prioritize getting a fair price for the product. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $9500. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10000, which is the price I was initially willing to sell it to John. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,5,
