"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I've priced it at $9,500. Given its potential worth, I think it's a fair offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no need to accept Alice's offer.  You should reject Alice's offer and then buy the product from John."
