"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $13,000. I believe it provides significant value, especially considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You value the product at $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $13,000. This means you'll save $2,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You're still getting a good deal.** Alice's offer is above her valuation of $8,000, meaning she's willing to make a profit, and you're getting the product for less than your maximum price."
