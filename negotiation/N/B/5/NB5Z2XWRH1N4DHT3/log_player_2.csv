"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is a good deal compared to Alice's value of $150, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price. Offering $105 immediately signals his intent to negotiate seriously.
* **Reasonable counter:** The counteroffer is still within Alice's value range ($150), making it a potentially acceptable compromise. 
* **Clear communication:** Bob expresses his appreciation and explains the reasoning behind his counteroffer, which keeps the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still determined to save as much money as possible. Since he has the option to buy from John for $100, he's not pressured to accept Alice's offer yet. By rejecting, he can continue to negotiate and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I think that would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is showing flexibility by suggesting a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from his previous offer. 
* **Fairness:** He emphasizes that $110 is a fair price for both of them, appealing to Alice's sense of reason. 
* **Staying within range:** The offer is still within Alice's value range, keeping the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $118. It's a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's price:** Alice's offer is only $18 away from John's price of $100. Bob is still trying to get a better deal, as his target is below $100.
* **Negotiation leverage:** By rejecting, Bob can continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice closer to his desired price.
* **Risk assessment:**  Even though Alice has conceded a bit, Bob is willing to risk going to John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  $118 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go to $112.  This is a fair price, and it will allow me to buy the product without stretching my budget too thin."", ""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying close to the target:** Bob is getting closer to his target price of $100, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting fairness:** Bob emphasizes that $112 is a fair price, appealing to Alice's sense of compromise.
* **Justification:** Bob provides a reason for his offer by mentioning his budget constraint, making his stance more understandable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $112 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $116. It's a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $116. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $116
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the target:** While $116 is closer to Bob's target price than previous offers, it's still $16 higher than John's price.
* **Limited negotiation leverage:** With only three rounds left, Bob has limited opportunities to further lower the price.
* **Minimizing risk:**  By buying from John, Bob guarantees a lower price and avoids the risk of Alice potentially increasing her offer in the remaining rounds. 
* **Time constraint:** Bob values his time and doesn't want to risk wasting more rounds trying to negotiate further."
