"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great price for the product, considering its value.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,875? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still being a good deal for you.  Let's try to close this deal,  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny.",8875.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,875 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",8750.0,Bob,6,
