"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $12,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could we agree on $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to be flexible, Bob, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for working with me on this.  I can tell this is important to you.  To be fair, let's split the difference.  Would you be willing to meet at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've got to be honest, I'm getting close to my limit.  I can do $8,500, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.  It's a fair offer.",8500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm getting close to my limit too. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Alice,9,
