Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) who is willing to pay your minimum price of $12,000, there's no reason to offer Bob a lower price. You maximize your earnings by offering him your minimum acceptable price.  If he rejects, you simply sell to John."
