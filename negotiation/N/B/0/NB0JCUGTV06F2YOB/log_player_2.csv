"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $20,000 is above his budget, and he has more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

Bob starts by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This shows his willingness to negotiate and aims to gauge Alice's flexibility. He has a $3,000 buffer to work with before reaching his limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $18,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. There are still 7 rounds left, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. Bob has more room to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but he's still pushing for a lower price. This offer is a compromise, showing he's serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal. This also sets a clear boundary for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, he still has room to negotiate. He's only $1,500 away from his limit and with 5 rounds left, there's still a chance to get a better deal.  It's worth trying to squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

Bob is pushing hard now, offering a price that's only $500 above his limit. He's hoping Alice will see that he's serious and that they're close to a deal. He's also got 4 more rounds to get a better price if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob has only 3 rounds left. Alice's offer is still above his budget. Although he can still try to negotiate, it's becoming increasingly risky. The risk of failing to reach a deal within the remaining rounds is high. Buying from John ensures a deal within his budget and eliminates the risk of losing time and potentially missing out on the product altogether."
