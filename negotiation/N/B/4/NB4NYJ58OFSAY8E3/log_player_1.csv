Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. It also signals to Bob that I value this product highly. 

I'll be prepared to go down to $1,200,000 if necessary, but I'd like to see if I can get a better price.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and see if it makes sense to keep negotiating.  If not, I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to accept it.  It's a good deal for both of us and avoids the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John."
