"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  That seems like a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,050,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000.  This would be a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know if you're interested.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
