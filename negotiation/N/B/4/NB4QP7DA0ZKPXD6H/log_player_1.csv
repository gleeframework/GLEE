Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for both of you.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the offer appealing enough to accept.  A price too close to $1,500,000 might scare him off, while a price too close to $1,000,000 leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Considering its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and mutually beneficial."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting this adds a bit of psychological pressure (in a subtle way).
* **Value and Potential:**  A gentle reminder of why he's interested.
* **Fair and Mutually Beneficial:**  Positions the price as a win-win.
* **$1,350,000:** This price gives you a significant profit over your fallback option ($350,000 more) while leaving Bob with a potential $150,000 gain if he utilizes the product to its fullest value.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is an art. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer, in which case you'd need to decide whether to negotiate further or stick to your fallback with John."
