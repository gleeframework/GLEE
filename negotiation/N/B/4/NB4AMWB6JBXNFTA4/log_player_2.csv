"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your ventures.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since John is willing to sell for exactly that amount, Bob should reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save $50,000."
