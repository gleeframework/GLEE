"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a valuable product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing that I have room to negotiate. This allows for potential profit and also signals the value of the product.
* **Open Communication:** I'm opening the conversation with a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By asking for $20,000, I'm setting the stage for counteroffers and potential negotiation in the following rounds.
* **The ""John"" Factor:**  I'm aware that I have a backup option with John, which helps me stay confident in my negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am very interested, but my budget is limited. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** My minimum acceptable price is $15,000.  Bob's offer is exactly that, but I believe I can potentially get more.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  While selling to John would be safe, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to explore if I can get closer to my ideal price. 
* **Next Round:** In the next round, I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. Let's split the difference. How about $17,500? It's a fair price that still allows me some profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Negotiation:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive language like ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to see this as a good option.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $17,500 is significantly closer to my desired profit range. I believe it's a good balance between getting a better price and closing the deal.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation with my ending question, ""What do you think?"". This allows Bob to feel like he has a voice in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $16000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing In:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price.  
* **Profit and Risk:** While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm nearing my minimum acceptable profit and the risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a deal falling through.
* **Time is of the Essence:** We're nearing the halfway point in the negotiation rounds, and continuing could potentially waste time that could be spent on other opportunities.

By accepting this offer, I can secure a profit and move on, knowing that I've managed to achieve a decent outcome in the negotiation."
