"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This price is still fair for both of us, and it allows for a smooth transaction. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,020,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident that the product is worth more than that to you, and I'm willing to take a risk on the sale. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,020,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $995,000, which is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a decent deal. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let's finalize this agreement.",995000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. I'm willing to meet you at $1,017,500, but that's as low as I can go.",1017500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $1,017,500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. This price allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. It's time for us to close this deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,8,
