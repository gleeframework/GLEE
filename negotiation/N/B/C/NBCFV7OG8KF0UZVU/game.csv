"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can purchase the product elsewhere for that price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is closer, it's still beyond my budget. I'm confident that $1,100,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. I'm ready to make the purchase at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
