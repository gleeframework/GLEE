Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, taking into account:

* **My minimum:** I want at least $10,000, so I'm not going lower than that.
* **Bob's value:**  He values the product at $12,000, so I can aim for a price closer to that.
* **Negotiation space:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer, but still ensuring I get a good price. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,500 is less than my desired $10,000, so accepting it would mean a loss for me. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I can try to negotiate with Bob further, aiming for a price closer to my ideal. I'm not desperate to sell and can use the threat of selling to John as leverage.

Let's see if I can counter Bob's offer and get a better price!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my previous offer.
* **Maintaining a margin:** $11,000 is still above my minimum and gives me a decent profit.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to strengthen my position. 

Let's see if this counteroffer convinces Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and my original offer of $10,500. Can you consider $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,750 is slightly above my minimum of $10,000.
* **Limited negotiation space:**  Further negotiation might not result in a significantly better price. I've already conceded a good amount.
* **Avoiding potential loss:** Rejecting Bob's offer risks losing him as a buyer entirely and being forced to sell to John for less.

This offer is a reasonable compromise, and accepting it secures a sale that's close to my desired price."
