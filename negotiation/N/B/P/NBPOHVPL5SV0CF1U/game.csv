"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to compromise, but $1,300,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This is still a great deal for you, as it's well below what the product is worth to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have costs to consider, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $1,300,000. I'd be willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,275,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. ",1275000.0,Alice,5,
