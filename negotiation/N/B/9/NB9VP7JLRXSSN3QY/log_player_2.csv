"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth no more than $120 to Bob. Alice's offer of $65 is significantly lower than Bob's maximum price.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Offering $50 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $65, but still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to compromise while also pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $60 is a better offer than Alice's initial $65, it's still not ideal for Bob. He's willing to pay up to $120, so there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to counter-offer gives Bob the opportunity to potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 55} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Alice's offer, but still pushing for a lower price.  $55 is a reasonable middle ground that could potentially lead to a deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $62. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $62
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $62 is approaching Bob's maximum price of $120.  While it would be ideal to get a lower price, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price, and avoids the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially losing out on the product altogether."
