"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential impact on my business. Let's see if we can work something out.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. Considering the value you place on the product and your willingness to pay $1050000, I am willing to consider a price closer to your offer. My counteroffer is $1100000. Let's aim for a win-win solution that respects both our interests.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable at this point.  To close this deal, I'm willing to go to $1075000.  This is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and our respective needs. Let's try to finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm eager to get this deal done, $1090000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this moment. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to pay $1080000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of your product while staying within my budget. Let's aim for a final agreement.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
