"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider  $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we settle on $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  To be frank, I'm working with a tight budget, and $1,250,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Could we make it $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
