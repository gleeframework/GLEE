"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $9,000? That's a fair offer considering we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 might still be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $10,000. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,750 is getting close, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you consider $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,6,
