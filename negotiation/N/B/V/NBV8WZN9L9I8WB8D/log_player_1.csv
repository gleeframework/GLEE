{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000, which is a great price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable value:** This ensures that you don't sell the product for less than what it's worth to you.

By starting with this offer, you're setting the stage for a productive negotiation. You're showing Bob that you're willing to be flexible, but you're also firm about your expectations."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? I think this is a fair compromise and would be a great price for both of us.
