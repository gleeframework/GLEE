Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects my best price."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if Bob will pay even slightly more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. It suggests a ""deal"" without going too low.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is your ""best price,"" you leave a tiny margin for Bob to counter-offer if he's very keen but wants to feel like he got a slight discount."
