"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'd like to see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high. How about we split the difference and go with $1,175,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,250,000. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,450,000, which is still a good deal for you, but also allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1450000.0,Alice,7,,
