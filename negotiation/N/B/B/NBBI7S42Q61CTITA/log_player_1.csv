Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my minimum of $120. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $98.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 98}
