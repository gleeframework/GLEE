"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. It's worth at least $100 to me, so it's a great deal for you if you're interested. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $150 for the product, and Alice is offering it for the same price, there's no advantage to buying from her. You can get the product for the same price from John. Therefore, it's better to reject Alice's offer."
