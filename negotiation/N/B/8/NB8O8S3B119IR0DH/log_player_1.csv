Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a decent profit margin while still leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $110.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial price. I'm hoping he'll recognize the value of the product and be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's not worth risking losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  Accepting his offer ensures I get my minimum profit."
