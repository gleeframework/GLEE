Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible without scaring him off. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit higher ($115) allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a fallback option with John at $100, ensuring you don't lose out completely if Bob declines. 

This strategy balances maximizing your profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
