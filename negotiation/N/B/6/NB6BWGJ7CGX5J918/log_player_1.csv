{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also reasonable considering the product is worth $12,000 to Bob.  We'll see how he reacts and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $8,900?  That's a significant step from my initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$8,900 is a good price, close to my desired range, and I don't want to risk losing Bob altogether. Accepting his offer is the best option at this point."
