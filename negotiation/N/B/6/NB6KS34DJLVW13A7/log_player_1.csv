Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice needs at least $1,500,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000.

**Alice's Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible from Bob, knowing she has John as a backup.  There's room for negotiation, but pushing too hard could make Bob walk away.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially setting the price at $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal, but I'm open to discussing further if needed."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  Alice starts high but leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Alice signals a willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""unique value"" subtly reminds Bob of the potential benefits.

**Important Note:** This is a single offer. In a real negotiation, there would be back-and-forth communication."
