Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial price is a bit high. I'm prepared to offer $650,000 for it.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap. I can appreciate your position on the product's value, so I'm willing to increase my offer to $725,000. This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the need for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

We're still far apart, but Bob is showing willingness to negotiate upwards. It's too early to settle for $725,000 when we have John as a backup."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. While I appreciate your revised offer, we're still a fair distance apart.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your willingness to compromise shows you're serious about getting this deal done.  To be completely transparent, my absolute ceiling on this is $800,000.  If you can meet that, we have an agreement today.  If not, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options, even though I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has just revealed his maximum price ($800,000).  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll go higher. Accepting his offer secures a reasonable profit, whereas continuing the negotiation risks losing him entirely."
