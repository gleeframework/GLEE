{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested in proceeding."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000).** This incentivizes him to accept the offer rather than risk losing the product entirely.

By starting with a relatively high price, I can potentially secure a better deal for myself while still keeping the negotiation open and appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is a bit too pricey for me at the moment. I'd be willing to offer $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to settle just yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for something closer to my initial proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still offers you a substantial profit, and it's a good starting point for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I also want to ensure I get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $925,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000 and is close enough to my desired price point that I'm happy to accept it.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
