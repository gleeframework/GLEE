Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $150 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
