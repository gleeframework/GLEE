"Alice, your initial offer is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential of this product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I appreciate you recognizing the potential of this product. While your offer is reasonable, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $1,900,000. This reflects the true value and the unique advantages it offers.  Are you open to exploring options around this figure?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I acknowledge the value you're placing on this product, $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. This price reflects the potential of the product while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
