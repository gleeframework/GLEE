Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, I'll see how he values the product based on his counteroffer.  I'm also keeping John in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't work out."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering a price of $1,450,000. This shows him I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a significant profit for me.  If he rejects again, I'll have to reconsider my options."

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000.  This is a compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair price.  If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."

Bob's offer is getting too low for me to continue negotiating.  I'd rather sell to John for $1,000,000 than risk getting a worse price from Bob."
