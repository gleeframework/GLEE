"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far below what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $700,000. Would that be feasible?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 is simply not enough for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to meet my needs while ensuring you get a valuable product at a competitive price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
