"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far below what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 is simply not enough for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to meet my needs while ensuring you get a valuable product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and you have a guaranteed option at $800,000. There's no point in risking a worse deal by continuing to negotiate."
