"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,000,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $925,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget. Let's work together to close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can get there together.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $950,000. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000, but I'll throw in some additional services or support to sweeten the deal?",975000.0,Alice,7,
