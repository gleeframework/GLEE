"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $140 is a bit out of my budget right now. Would you be willing to consider $125? I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $132?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think.",132.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $132 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
