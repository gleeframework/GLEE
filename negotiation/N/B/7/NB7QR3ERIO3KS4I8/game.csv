"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that you've shown interest in. My asking price is $14,000.  I'm confident it's a great value for you, considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This gives you a great deal, and I can still make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but  $11,500 just doesn't work for me. Let's try to get closer. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and we can close this deal. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
