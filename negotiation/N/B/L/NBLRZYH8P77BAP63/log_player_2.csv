"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135.  It's a great deal for a product worth much more. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product from John for $120, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $135.  You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $135 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  While $125 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  This still represents a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has lowered her price to $130, but you can still get the product from John for $120. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice as you're guaranteed a lower price with John."
