"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers you a significant return on investment.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,400,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I'm confident that this product's inherent value justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. I believe this strikes a balance that acknowledges its worth while still making it an attractive acquisition for you.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,650,000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I understand your position, and in the spirit of compromise, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,575,000. I truly believe this product will exceed your expectations and prove to be a worthwhile investment at this price.",1575000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,575,000 is the right price. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",1450000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I've been flexible throughout our negotiations, but I need to be frank. Your current offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to consider $1,525,000, but this is my final offer.  I believe it's a fair deal considering the potential benefits you'll reap.",1525000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're being firm on the price, but I'm still trying to be responsible with my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,475,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",1475000.0,Bob,8,
