Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** We're unlikely to get much higher than $1,475,000 from Bob.  He's consistently countered in a predictable pattern. 
* **Time Value:** We're running out of rounds.  Holding out for an extra $25,000-$50,000 isn't worth the risk of losing Bob altogether.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  $1,475,000 is a significant profit over our $1,000,000 minimum.

While we could push a bit further, it's a riskier move at this point. Accepting secures a very good deal."
