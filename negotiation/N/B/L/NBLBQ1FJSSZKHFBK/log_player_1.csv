Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 sets a strong floor. Alice wants to get as close to that as possible while still making the deal attractive to Bob.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 gives Bob a potential $50,000 gain while still netting Alice a significant profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the message is firm, it leaves some space open in case Bob wants to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while ensuring Alice doesn't miss out on a guaranteed sale to John."
