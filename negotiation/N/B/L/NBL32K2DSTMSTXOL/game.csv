"I've already given you a significant discount, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $155, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free accessory that's worth $20, so the total value you'll get is $175. I'll still sell it to you for $155.",155.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not going to budge on the price, Bob. I've already given you a great deal with the free accessory. I'll tell you what - I'll throw in another accessory, worth $10, on top of the first one. That's a total of $30 in extras. I'll still sell it to you for $155.",155.0,Alice,9,
