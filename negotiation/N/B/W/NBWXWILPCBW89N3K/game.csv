"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $17,000 for it. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate. $14,500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $16,250?  That's a good compromise, and still leaves some room for both of us to be happy.",16250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13,750? I'm trying to be fair, but I really need to stay within my budget.",13750.0,Bob,4,
