**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's a better price than her initial asking price, it's still above my maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting the sense we're not going to be able to come to an agreement. I'm willing to offer one final price of $975,000. This is my absolute limit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the other options available. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll need to move on to other opportunities."", ""product_price"": 975000}
