"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value and uniqueness of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1500000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while staying within my financial constraints.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1700000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet the price of $1700000. Could we perhaps aim for $1600000? This would be closer to what I am able to afford while still recognizing the value of the product.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm counteroffering at $1650000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget, Alice. However, I am still unable to reach the price of $1650000. I propose a final counteroffer of $1600000. This would be the highest I can reasonably offer while respecting the value of the product.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
