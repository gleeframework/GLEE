"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. My initial offer is $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get a better price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,000 for it. How about we discuss a price of $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to compromise further and offer $14,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not sure $14,000 is enough to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to consider a price of $16,500, which is closer to what I need to get. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $16,500 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $15,000.  This is a fair price considering we're both trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",15000.0,Bob,6,
