"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. I believe it's worth at least $120, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  It makes no sense to accept it."
