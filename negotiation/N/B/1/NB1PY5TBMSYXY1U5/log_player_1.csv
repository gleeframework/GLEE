Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. I believe it's worth at least $120, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 
 

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Starting High:** By starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value and your minimum, you leave room for negotiation. Even if he counters, you're likely to settle for a price higher than $120.
* **Justification:**  While not overly detailed, mentioning that you believe it's worth at least $120 provides a subtle anchor for Bob, making the $150 seem less arbitrary. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests you're open to discussion, increasing the likelihood of Bob engaging rather than just rejecting the offer outright.
 
Remember, the worst Bob can do is say no, at which point you have your backup buyer John."
