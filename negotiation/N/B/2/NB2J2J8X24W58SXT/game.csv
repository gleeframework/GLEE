"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $145? I believe this is a fair price that gives you a good value and allows me to make a profit. Let me know what you think!",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $145 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that.  However, $130 is just below my minimum.  To make this work for both of us, how about we settle on $135? This is a fair price that allows me to make a small profit while still offering you a great value. Let me know what you think!",135.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $132.50. Can you consider this price?",132.5,Bob,6,
