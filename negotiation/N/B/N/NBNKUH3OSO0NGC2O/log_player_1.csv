Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you are subtly reminding Bob that it's worth a significant amount, even if you don't explicitly state your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation process and potentially counter-offer.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still maintaining a professional and respectful tone with Bob."
