"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's lower than John's price, there's significant room for negotiation. It's in Bob's best interest to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $900,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value and my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still too high for Bob.  While it's a compromise, there's still room for negotiation to get closer to Bob's desired price. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $800,000. This price is fair to both of us, and would allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 800000}
