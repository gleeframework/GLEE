{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,350,000**.  This is more than Alice's value of $1,200,000, so she is making a profit.
* **Your maximum value is $1,500,000**. 
* **John's offer is $1,500,000**.
* **By rejecting Alice's offer, you can buy from John for $1,500,000, saving $150,000 compared to Alice's offer.**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and purchase from John."
