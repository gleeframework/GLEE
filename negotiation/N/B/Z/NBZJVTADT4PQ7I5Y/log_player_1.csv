Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and more likely to engage.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to negotiation to show flexibility and encourage Bob to counteroffer. 

**This approach allows me to:**

* Gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* Start the negotiation process. 
* Potentially secure a price higher than my minimum while keeping the option to sell to John for $8,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand that you're open to negotiation, and I'd like to propose a lower price of $9500. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is only slightly lower than my initial offer of $10,000.  Considering my minimum is $8,000, accepting his offer is a good deal. It allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid the potential risk of further negotiation."
