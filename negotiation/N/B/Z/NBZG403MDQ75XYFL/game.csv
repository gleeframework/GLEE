"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to compromise further and sell the product to you for $120, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,5,
