"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider it. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite low for what this product offers. Could you do $18,000? I'm willing to be flexible if we can find a middle ground.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $18,000 is better, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's make this happen - How about $16,000? This is my final offer. ",16000.0,Alice,5,
