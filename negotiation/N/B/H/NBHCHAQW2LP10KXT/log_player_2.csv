"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that, once you see it in action, you'll agree this is a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $2,300,000 is far more than his budget, and he can get the product from John for a much lower price. He should aim to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time. This is a fair price given my valuation of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the product truly offers unique advantages, and $1,200,000 significantly undervalues its capabilities. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,900,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than what he's willing to spend.  He should continue negotiating and try to get a lower price.  He can always go with John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,900,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering my valuation of the product and the fact that I have a backup option. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
