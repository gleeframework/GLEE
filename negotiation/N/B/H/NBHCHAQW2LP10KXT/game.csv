"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that, once you see it in action, you'll agree this is a very competitive price.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time. This is a fair price given my valuation of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the product truly offers unique advantages, and $1,200,000 significantly undervalues its capabilities. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,900,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering my valuation of the product and the fact that I have a backup option. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
