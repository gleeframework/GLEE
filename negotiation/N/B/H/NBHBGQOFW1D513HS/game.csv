"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  Would you be willing to consider $1,300,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While I recognize the product's value, $1,300,000 is still a bit much. Could we settle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
