Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  While I appreciate your offer,  $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we might be at an impasse. While I want to find a solution that works for both of us, $8,000 is simply too low. To be completely transparent, I have another offer on the table for $12,000. If you're able to meet that, the product is yours. Otherwise, I'll need to consider the other offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
