"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000, I'm open to negotiation. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $1,125,000?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but Bob's offer is still significantly below John's guaranteed price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to push closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1,250,000? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This offer is a strong strategic move. Here's why:

* **Splits the Difference:** It shows willingness to compromise while still remaining above John's offer.
* **Finality:**  By stating it's my final offer, I create a sense of urgency and put the decision squarely in Bob's court.
* **Above Guarantee:**  It ensures I still gain a profit above John's guaranteed purchase price, mitigating risk."
