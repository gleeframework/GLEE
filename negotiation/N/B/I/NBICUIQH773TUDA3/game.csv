"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $250 is a bit out of my budget. How about $120? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $250 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $200? I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still need to make a profit on this deal.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $200 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $175. I'm eager to make this deal work.",175.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $175. How about we meet at $185? I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done.",185.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $185.  How about we meet in the middle at $180? This would be a good deal for both of us.",180.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a bit more profit on this deal. How about we meet at $182? I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done.",182.0,Alice,7,
