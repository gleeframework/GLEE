Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible while still securing a profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Time Value:** While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even at a slightly lower price.

This strategy balances getting a good price from Bob with the security of John's offer."
