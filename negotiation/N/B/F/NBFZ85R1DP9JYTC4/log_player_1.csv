Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

Explanation: Bob has now hit his maximum valuation of the product.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with him as it's unlikely he'll go any higher. Selling to John guarantees you your minimum acceptable price."
