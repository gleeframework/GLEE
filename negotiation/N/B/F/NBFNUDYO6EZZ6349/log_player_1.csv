"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is a good starting point because it allows for potential negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I am happy with the price offered by Bob,  I think I can get a bit more.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and secure a sale that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. While I'm starting to get a little worried about time, I'm still going to reject his offer.  I think I can get a bit more.  It's time to see if I can  push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000.  This is still above my minimum price, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  If Bob accepts, I'll be happy with the deal.  However, if he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider my options and potentially move on to John.  The clock is ticking, and I'm starting to run out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for my liking.  I've already made several concessions, but his offers keep going down.  I'm not sure I can get him to budge much further, and I'm running out of time.  To ensure I get at least my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John. It's a guaranteed deal, and while I'd love to get more, this is the safest option at this point."
