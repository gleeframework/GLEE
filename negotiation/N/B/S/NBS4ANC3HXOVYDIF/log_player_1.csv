Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's more than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll have to consider lowering the price, but I can also use the threat of selling to John to incentivize him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's closer to his perceived value, it's still far below what I need to earn. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll try to meet him halfway, but I'll still aim for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm offering $925,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price closer to my desired value. I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to my price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's closer to my desired value, it's still far below what I need to earn.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll try to meet him halfway again, but I'll still aim for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000. This is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be a compromise that Bob will accept.  If he rejects, I might consider selling to John as I'm getting closer to the point where his offer is not worth the continued negotiation."
