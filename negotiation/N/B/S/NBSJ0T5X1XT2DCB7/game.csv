"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,
