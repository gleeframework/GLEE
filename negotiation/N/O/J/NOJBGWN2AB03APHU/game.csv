"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $2,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the true value of this product and the return on investment it offers.  I'm willing to move from my initial price, but I propose a price of $1,950,000.  This reflects a more realistic valuation.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move from your initial price, but I still think $1,950,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,950,000 and $1,150,000, which is $1,550,000. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
