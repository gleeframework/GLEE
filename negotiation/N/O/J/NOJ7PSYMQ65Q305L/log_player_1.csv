{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to Bob's $12,000 value as possible without risking him going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $11,500 is a bit high. Would you be willing to consider $10,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low, but it's still closer to my ideal price than John's offer. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we meet in the middle at $11,150?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $10,900 is only $100 less than my minimum acceptable price of $10,800.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with John's offer of $10,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
