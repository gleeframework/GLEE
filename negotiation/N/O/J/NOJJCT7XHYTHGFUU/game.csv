"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $120? This would still be a good value for you, and we can both walk away happy.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you meet me in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about $115?  That's closer to your offer and would still leave us both satisfied.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",107.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good price, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $112.50.  This meets you halfway and leaves us both with a fair deal. What do you say?",112.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $105. Can we agree on that price?",105.0,Bob,8,
