Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to you and your business. I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $1,350,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its potential worth."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a high price of $1,350,000 sets a strong anchor point for negotiation. While it's above Bob's perceived value, it leaves room for negotiation while staying well above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value might be even higher than Bob realizes, justifying the high starting price. 
* **Alternative:** The message doesn't explicitly mention John, but the fact that you have another buyer willing to pay your full asking price gives you a strong bargaining position.

**Goal:** The goal is to maximize profit.  While you could offer it at $800,001 and be guaranteed a sale, aiming higher allows you to potentially secure a significantly better deal."
