"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $200. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum threshold of $150.  I want to gauge Bob's initial interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not in a hurry to close the deal. I want to see if I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that this price will be appealing to Bob, but still allow me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $160. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a reasonable compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit.  There's a chance Bob might offer more in the next round, but with limited rounds remaining, it's safer to close the deal now."
