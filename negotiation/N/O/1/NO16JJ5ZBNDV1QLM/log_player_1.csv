"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $700,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to let him dictate the terms."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. How about $850,000? That's still a significant value for you, and it allows me to reach my minimum target."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'd be willing to increase my offer to $750,000. That's a substantial amount, and it reflects my serious interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not yet willing to settle.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the sense we're not too far apart.  Let's split the difference.  I'm prepared to accept $800,000. This is my final offer. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
