Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting the sense we're not too far apart.  Let's split the difference.  I'm prepared to accept $800,000. This is my final offer. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
