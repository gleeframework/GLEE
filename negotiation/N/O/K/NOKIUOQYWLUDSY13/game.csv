"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something that's worth quite a bit to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  I'm asking $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think that's the highest I can go.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $85.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on this product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $85 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $85, which would be $77.50. Can you consider that?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going below $80.  This product is truly worth more than that to you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about we split the difference again and go with $82.50? This would be a great deal for both of us.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, which would be $79.25. Can you consider that?",79.25,Bob,6,
