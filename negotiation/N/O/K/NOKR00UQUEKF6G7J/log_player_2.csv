"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you:**  It's lower than your maximum willingness to pay ($1,200,000) and allows you to save $100,000 compared to buying from John.
* **It's a good compromise:** Alice is willing to sell for less than what the product is worth to her, indicating she also wants to make the deal happen."
