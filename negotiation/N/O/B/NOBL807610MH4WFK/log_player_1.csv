This offer is a starting point.  Since I know I can sell the product to John for $10,000, I'm offering it to Bob for $15,000. This gives me a good profit margin if he accepts, and if he rejects, I'm still covered by John's offer.  I'll need to monitor Bob's response and potentially adjust my offer depending on his reaction."
