"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, I believe we can find a price closer to its true value for me. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. It makes more sense to counter offer at this stage as there is a lot of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $750,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment for you.  I could consider a price of $890,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $860,000 for the product. I believe this reflects a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000

Bob's offer of $860,000 is a significant improvement and surpasses your minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer secures a healthy profit above your baseline and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing the deal altogether."
