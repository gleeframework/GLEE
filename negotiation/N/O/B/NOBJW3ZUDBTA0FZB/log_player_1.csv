``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not excessively so. It gives Bob room to counter while still leaving you with a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  $9,500 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9800 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still determined to get closer to my ideal price. I will reject Bob's offer and try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to go down to $10,200. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10000. I'm willing to pay $9900 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made several counteroffers and it seems like we're at an impasse. To avoid further negotiation and secure a guaranteed $10,000, I will sell the product to John."
