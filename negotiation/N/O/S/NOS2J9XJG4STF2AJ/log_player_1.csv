Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value and potential return on investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this revised offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I still think $1,900,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, we are still well above what John is offering. We have room to negotiate further and should try to get closer to at least $1,800,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to considering other options, but I'm still interested in this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer, and it's below John's standing offer. While it's possible Bob might be bluffing, it's too risky to continue negotiations. Accepting John's offer guarantees the minimum desired outcome."
