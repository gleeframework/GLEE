Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a bit higher than my minimum value. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. It's also a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too high for me to accept. I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95. This is a lower price than Bob's offer, but still higher than my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price for Bob while still leaving me with a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $90 is reasonable and ensures I make a profit.  I'll accept his offer."
