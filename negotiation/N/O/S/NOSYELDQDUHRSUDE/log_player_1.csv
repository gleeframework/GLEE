"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset to your portfolio. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a strong offer slightly below my minimum ($1,200,000) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a firm stance.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and benefits for Bob, fostering a collaborative tone.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I understand this is just the first round, and I'm prepared for Bob to negotiate. This initial offer sets the stage for a potentially successful back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is still a good value for you given your own valuation.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal.  Selling to John at this point would be a last resort. I have plenty of rounds left to try and reach a more favorable agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. I understand your perspective on the value, but to be honest, $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,050,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Firm:**  I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and willingness to negotiate, but I want to reiterate that I'm seeking a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Strategic Compromise:** Offering to meet ""halfway"" sounds reasonable and might be appealing to Bob. However,  ""halfway"" is based on my initial price, not his counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation anchored closer to my target range.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** I continue using a collaborative and understanding tone to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which is a good sign. However, the current offer is still significantly below my $1,200,000 walk-away point. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can nudge him closer to my target range in the upcoming rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1 million.  Would you be willing to consider $1,025,000? I believe this represents a fair compromise for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I'm explicitly stating my desired price range, anchoring the negotiation closer to $1 million.
* **Smaller Concession:** My counteroffer is a smaller decrease than Bob's increase, signaling that I'm getting closer to my limit.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** By positioning the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" I aim to make Bob feel like he's getting a reasonable deal. 
* **Continued Collaboration:** The tone remains positive and collaborative, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference and agree on $987,500.  This is a fair compromise that leaves us both with a good deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is suggesting a ""split the difference"" approach, he's basing it on his initial offer, not on the concessions made in recent rounds. I need to hold firm on my valuation. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I will start leaning towards accepting John's offer if Bob doesn't make a more significant move soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right that we're both aiming for a fair deal. Let's be real - splitting the difference based on where we started doesn't reflect the progress we've made.  I'm willing to come down to $1,010,000, but that's my final offer. It's a very competitive price for a product of this value."", 
""product_price"": 1010000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Transparent:**  I'm directly addressing Bob's ""split the difference"" tactic and explaining why it's not a truly fair assessment of the current negotiation.
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm conveying a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm reaching my limit.
* **Justification and Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value and positioning my final offer as ""very competitive"" to make it more appealing.
* **Time Pressure:** With fewer rounds remaining, I'm increasing the time pressure on Bob to either accept a price close to my target or risk losing the deal."
