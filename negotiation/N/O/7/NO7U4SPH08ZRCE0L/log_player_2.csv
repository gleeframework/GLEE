"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better price.  There's also the option of buying from John as a fallback, providing some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering your own valuation and the potential for further negotiations, I'd be willing to pay $700,000. Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the potential for further negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, but her offer of $900,000 is still above her own valuation. There's still room for improvement, and Bob should continue to try to lower the price. The option of buying from John provides a safety net and leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our last two offers and go with $800,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go back to the original $800,000 I offered. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is still a compromise, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving closer to Bob's desired price:**  The offer of $850,000 is within Bob's budget and closer to his desired price range. 
* **Time is a factor:**  It's important to remember that Bob has a limited number of rounds. Continuing to negotiate may result in a better price, but also risks losing the deal altogether. 
* **John's price is still a fallback:**  While accepting this offer means paying more than Alice's original valuation, it's still significantly less than buying from John. Bob maintains a safety net if further negotiations fail. 

**In this scenario, it's reasonable for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's still favorable to him.**"
