"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering your own valuation and the potential for further negotiations, I'd be willing to pay $700,000. Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the potential for further negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our last two offers and go with $800,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go back to the original $800,000 I offered. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is still a compromise, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
