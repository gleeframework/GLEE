Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering your own valuation and the potential for further negotiations, I'd be willing to pay $700,000. Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our last two offers and go with $800,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.
