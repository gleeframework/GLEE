"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $5,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your initial offer, $5,000 is significantly below its value.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $8,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  How about we settle on $11,000? This feels like a fair offer considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. That's a very strong offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the market.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $9,000. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk Bob walking away in the remaining rounds."
