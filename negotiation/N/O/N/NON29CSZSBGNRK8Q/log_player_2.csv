"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $125 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $125.  It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a little more.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could try to negotiate further, $115 is a good price. You're getting the product for $15 less than what John is selling it for, and you're still saving $10 compared to Alice's initial offer. It's a win-win!"
