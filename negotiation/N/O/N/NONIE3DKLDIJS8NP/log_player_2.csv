# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $8,750. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $8,750 is a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than what John is selling it for, and it's a reasonable compromise from Alice's previous offer."
