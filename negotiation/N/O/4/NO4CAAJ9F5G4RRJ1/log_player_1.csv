Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing we have John as a backup.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is the highest we can realistically ask for, starting a bit lower might leave room for Bob to counter-offer and still land above our minimum. 

This offer aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
