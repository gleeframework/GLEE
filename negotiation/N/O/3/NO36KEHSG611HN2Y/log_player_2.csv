"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $9,500 is a good price, it's still early in the negotiation. There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower. I'll reject her offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, signaling my serious interest while leaving room for negotiation. I've chosen a price that's still within my budget, but low enough to encourage Alice to consider a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly, and while $8,500 is still a bit more than I wanted to pay, it's a fair compromise.  Since this is within my budget, I'll accept the offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
