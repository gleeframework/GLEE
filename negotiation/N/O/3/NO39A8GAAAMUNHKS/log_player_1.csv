{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to be friendly and communicate clearly to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price and I can potentially get a better deal in the next round, but it's not worth the risk. Selling to Bob now guarantees a profit and avoids the chance of a stalemate or having to sell to John for a lower price."
