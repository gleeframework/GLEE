"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me at the moment. I would be willing to purchase it for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $900,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position and I'm willing to move a bit. How about we settle on $975,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
