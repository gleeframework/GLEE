"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  $9,500 is the lowest I can go right now.  This product is truly worth it, and I believe we can find a mutually agreeable price.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $9,200 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,300.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I truly believe you'll get great value out of this product.  What do you say?",9300.0,Alice,5,
