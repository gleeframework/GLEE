"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, as it's already below the market value of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below market value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down from the market value. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me and allows us both to close a deal. "", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and allows us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than Bob's budget. He's willing to pay $1,250,000, and there's still room for Alice to come down a bit more. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to reach a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're still a bit higher than my desired price. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,290,000, which is still below the market value. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and allows us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already made a counteroffer and Alice is still unwilling to budge much. The price is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but there's still a risk Alice will continue to reject offers.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential savings. Buying from John guarantees the product at his maximum budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
