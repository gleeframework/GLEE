"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, as it's already below the market value of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down from the market value. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me and allows us both to close a deal. ",1250000.0,Bob,2,
