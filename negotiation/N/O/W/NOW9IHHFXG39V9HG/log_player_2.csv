"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I'm sure will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is your upper limit, it's always a good idea to try and negotiate a better price. There's no information about the actual value of the product, so there's potential for a lower price."

Round 2

You should continue to negotiate and aim for a price closer to $1,100,000."
