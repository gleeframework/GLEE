Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also still want a profit beyond my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $115 is too low for me. While I could keep negotiating, I'm concerned we won't be able to reach an agreement. John is already offering my minimum, so it's safer to sell to him and avoid further risk."
