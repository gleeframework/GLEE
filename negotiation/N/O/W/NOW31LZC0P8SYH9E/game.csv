"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for my business, but the price needs to work on my end. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount from the original price, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. Considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I still think there's room for us to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to sell the product for $650,000, as it's still below its true value to you. However, I'm willing to be more flexible. I'll sell it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
