Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount from the original price, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. Considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to sell the product for $650,000, as it's still below its true value to you. However, I'm willing to be more flexible. I'll sell it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
