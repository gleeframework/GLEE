"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  To be honest,  $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we settle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit short on budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $13,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
