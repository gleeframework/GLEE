Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $14,000?

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still a bit short on budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $13,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, and $13,500 is a reasonable compromise. Continuing to push for a lower price might irritate Alice and risk her walking away from the deal, leaving you to buy from John at the higher price."
