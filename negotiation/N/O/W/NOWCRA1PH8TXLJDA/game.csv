"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $13,000? It's still a fair price for the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to feel good about the transaction.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still not able to justify spending more than $12,000 on this product. I would like to propose a price of $12,000 to finalize the purchase. I hope this meets your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,4,
