Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You're not immediately going for the full $15,000, giving Bob some room to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  It's easy for Bob to understand.

Remember, you can adjust the price based on how the negotiations go, and you always have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $12,000 for your product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While selling to John for $12,000 is a secure option, rejecting Bob's offer is the best strategy for now. Here's why:

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob clearly values the product at $15,000. There's a chance you can negotiate a higher price than $12,000.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's initial offer, you demonstrate that you're not desperate to sell and that you're willing to walk away. This gives you more leverage in the negotiation.

In the next round, you can send a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price, perhaps somewhere between $12,000 and $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $13,000? It's still a fair price for the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to feel good about the transaction."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
``` 
This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's a reasonable increase from Bob's offer:**  It shows you're willing to negotiate but not settling for his initial price.
* **It's still below your ideal price:**  It leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant.
* **It's clearly communicated:**  You're expressing your willingness to find a compromise. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still not able to justify spending more than $12,000 on this product. I would like to propose a price of $12,000 to finalize the purchase. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut your losses and move on. Here's why selling to John is the best option:

* **No Further Negotiation Potential:** Bob is firm on his $12,000 offer. There's little chance of him budging further.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate will likely involve more back-and-forth with no guarantee of a better outcome.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  John is ready to purchase for $12,000. This ensures a quick and certain sale, minimizing risk.

While it's disappointing not to get a higher price, selling to John is the most practical choice in this situation. It's better to secure the sale than risk further negotiations with Bob that may lead to no deal at all."
