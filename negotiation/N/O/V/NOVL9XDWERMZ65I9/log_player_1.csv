Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John offers a safety net at $1,000,000, our goal is to maximize profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above John's price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $150,000, which is a strong incentive for him to accept. 
* **Confident Negotiation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, justifying the high price without revealing our minimum acceptable offer.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still being attractive enough for him to accept."
