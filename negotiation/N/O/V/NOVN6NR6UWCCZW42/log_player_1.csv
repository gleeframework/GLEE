{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, you'll love it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is higher than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $115 is less than the $120 Bob values the product at, meaning he has room to negotiate and still come out ahead. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for a back-and-forth that could potentially land you closer to Bob's maximum value.

Remember, I'm an AI and can't predict Bob's response. We'll adjust our strategy based on his actions!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $105 is a good price, it's still below what I can get from Bob and above what John will pay. I'm going to counteroffer to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
