"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $7,500 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to get it for a bit less, but I'm still hoping to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $7,250. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",7250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $7,250 is still a little high for me though.  How about $7,100? It's a fair price, and I'm really interested in the product.",7100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $7,200. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $7,175? It's a compromise, but I think it's a good middle ground.",7175.0,Alice,5,
