"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000, which is a significant discount from its true value to you. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,350,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value of the product to both of us. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
