"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000, which is a significant discount from its true value to you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is necessary:** You can likely get a better deal by rejecting and counteroffering. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You have the option to buy from John if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,350,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value of the product to both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  $1,350,000 is less than your maximum of $1,500,000.
* **A good compromise:**  Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and further negotiation might not result in a significantly better deal. 
* **Time is a factor:**  While you could continue negotiating, accepting this offer saves time and secures the product."
