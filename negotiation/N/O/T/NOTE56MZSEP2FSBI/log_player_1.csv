"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000.  I think it's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice. I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for something closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is just a little too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $12,000, considering the value of this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11000?  I'm very serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my desired price point.  Considering the limited rounds remaining, it's likely I won't get a much better offer. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit beyond my minimum threshold."
