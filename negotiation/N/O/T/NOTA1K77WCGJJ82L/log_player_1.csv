"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Given its unique potential and worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects the true value you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Negotiating is about finding a middle ground. By starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum, you leave room for concessions while aiming for a higher final price.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""unique potential"" and ""true value"" avoids revealing your minimum price while suggesting the product is worth more than Bob might think. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This high starting price helps gauge Bob's eagerness.  His response will reveal how much he values the product and how willing he is to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Based on my research, I believe the product's worth is closer to $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. Accepting now would be a substantial loss. You have room to negotiate, and selling to John guarantees your minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the product's value. However, your offer is a significant gap from what I consider fair. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth of this asset."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Stand Firm:**  You've made a substantial concession from your initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate. However, you're still keeping the price well above Bob's offer and closer to your desired range.
* **Reiterate Value:** By mentioning ""true worth,"" you're subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits, encouraging him to justify a higher price in his mind. 
* **Test the Waters:**  This counter-offer will help you understand how much Bob is willing to budge.  His next move will be crucial in determining your overall strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I still believe we can find a better price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll offer $1,550,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth and my initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now above your guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000). While you could try to push for more, there's a risk Bob might lower his offer in subsequent rounds.  Accepting now secures a profit above your minimum and avoids the potential of losing the deal altogether."
