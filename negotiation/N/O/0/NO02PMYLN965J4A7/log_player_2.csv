# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us â€“ you'll save $100,000 on its value to you, and I'll still be able to earn a substantial sum.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product from John for $800,000, which is a better deal than Alice's offer of $1,100,000."
