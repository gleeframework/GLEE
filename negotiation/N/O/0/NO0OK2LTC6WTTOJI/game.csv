"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $13500. Let's see if we can work something out.",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $13500 to you. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $14500? This would give us a good middle ground, and I believe it's a fair price for the value I see in this product.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go below $16000. However, I'm willing to make another concession to reach a deal. I'm offering the product to you for $15800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",15800.0,Alice,5,
