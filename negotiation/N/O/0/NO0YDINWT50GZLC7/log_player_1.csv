Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1,150,000. I think you'll find this a very fair price considering its potential value to you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While starting high, the offer leaves a little room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Securing a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $1,150,000 still earns you a $150,000 profit over your guaranteed sale to John.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a backup offer."
