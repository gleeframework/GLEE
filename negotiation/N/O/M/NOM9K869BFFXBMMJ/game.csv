,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings, and I'm confident you'll see it's worth it.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of a price of $1,250,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product brings and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go much lower than this.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000.
