"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I think it could be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm aiming to find a mutually agreeable price.  To start, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me right now. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be reasonable.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value. To be frank, $600,000 is quite a bit lower than I could consider.  Could you do $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bigger investment than I had in mind. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be totally transparent, $950,000 is cutting it very close to my absolute minimum. I could do $1,100,000, but that's my final offer. I do believe this product has the potential to be highly valuable for you. ",1100000.0,Alice,5,
