Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I am still unable to go beyond $12,000. I hope we can find a way to meet within this price range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly anchored at $12,000 and unlikely to budge much higher. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting even less. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best outcome in this situation."
