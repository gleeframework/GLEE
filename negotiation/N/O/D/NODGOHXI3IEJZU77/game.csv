"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000.  This is a fair price considering the quality and potential benefits.  Let me know what you think.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8000 for this product.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is significantly below what this product is truly worth.  I'm willing to come down to $12000. This price still reflects the value and potential benefits you'll gain, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 just doesn't cover the value I place on this product. However, I'm willing to make one last concession and meet you at $11000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $9500, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
