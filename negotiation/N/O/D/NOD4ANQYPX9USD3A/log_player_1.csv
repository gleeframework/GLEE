Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($150). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my desired value.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

I'm choosing to start with a higher offer as I have the option of selling to John for $150. This allows me to potentially maximize my profits by negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $150.  While it's tempting to accept a sale, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to potentially secure a better price. 

I'm also considering that John is a guaranteed buyer at $150, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but also proposing a counter-offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm also providing a reason for my counter-offer, highlighting that $90 is still a good deal for Bob. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, but $90 is still a bit much for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $75 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. While it's tempting to try to negotiate further, I'm realizing that time is valuable, and I can guarantee a sale to John for $150.  It's better to secure a certain profit now than risk a longer negotiation with an uncertain outcome."
