"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's something you've expressed interest in before, and I know you'd get good use out of it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $10,000 is the best option."
