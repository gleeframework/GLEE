"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to me is $1,500,000, but I'm willing to make some concessions to get it to the right buyer. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering the value to you, and it's the highest I can go at the moment. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering your value and my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $950,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to bridge the gap and offer $1,000,000. This is a very serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.  If you're open to this price, we can finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the value it holds for me.
